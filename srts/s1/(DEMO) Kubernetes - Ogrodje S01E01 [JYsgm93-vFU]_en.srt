1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's see if there's a new one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It still says mono 0.1, wow.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's alright.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If it was pre-mono 0.0, it would be 0.1.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What if you put an mp3 player, 40kb, 16 bits, stereo, 4 tones, something like that?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, we'll listen to it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Andraž, what do you think, if it's bad, will you record it again?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, I listen to the same things in the car, if the sound is good, then I skip it.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I mean, really, if you listen to a podcast, and you just listen, and you don't have a video,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I think it's pretty important for my point of view, how good the audio is.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I mean, I don't know if it's going to be a debate, or if it's going to be interesting,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but we'll play it anyway.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a very good approach.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Have you found a way to get it up?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, I thought, you can record 3-4 episodes, 3-4 files, and then upload it somewhere.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can be agile.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can be agile, you can go directly to the customer, you don't have to wait.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Release, then customer, then you look at the feedback.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean, you work, people ask for feedback, but you don't pick it up.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm really interested in Nenje, I don't know what he said to Jure Čuhalov on the debate.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He doesn't have time to listen to it.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How long did you work on it, and what did you come up with?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't know.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
More than 16 centimeters, what's the problem?

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, I mean, the format, the format.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Roga has 3 hours.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's too much.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I would say from 15 minutes to 20 minutes.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then we'll see the feedback.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I would aim for half an hour.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think that's just fine.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can see that.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Half an hour is very meaningful if the discussion is very intelligent.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I expected that from Umizja, right?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Or from Kauč, or whatever you want to call it.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't know.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You know, we won't have two guests and two moderators in the morning,

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
so that's fine.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Do you want to do something on the level of those dialogues?

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No, I think it would be good if you could see what's going on.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
For example, you can see that Heroku has an outage,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
which is an interesting topic.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can see that someone is asking,

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know, one is on GCP,

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and then my base is spinning,

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and there's a debate,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and you can see that React hooks are fucked up.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's an interesting topic.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And then someone comes and says,

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
listen, Darknet Diaries,

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I could listen to that.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I won't listen to it alone.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think it has a lot of impact.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In Slovenia?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't know about that.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you want to do something local,

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
with better quality...

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My question is,

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
do you want to do something like that,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
when they are here in the dialogue,

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and only in a different...

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, here in Selakovica,

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's more professional.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, I understand,

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but I want to say,

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the same concept,

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
where three or four get together

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and go with their limited expertise and knowledge

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to be smart,

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
smart,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
or...

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
With more alcohol and more cigarettes.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Or what else?

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And more scrappy.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because scrappy is the best keyword.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Lean.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Lean.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can design this logo in Paint.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Four circles,

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
plus the color inside.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And that's it.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't think there's any episode left.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't think there's any episode left.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I couldn't do anything,

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
no page,

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but when I had time,

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FPSR,

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
then you can connect it,

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and then you open the episode,

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and then you can pull it out

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and convert it yourself.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And you know,

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
this is cool.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Isn't it?

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So you can stream more,

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and then you can stream

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
something else.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hardcore listeners will listen to this one time.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
One time.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Actually,

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No, actually,

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
when you record in Wave,

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
then you record in MP3,

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but then you convert it back

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
to record on a cassette,

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and then you dispatch ten cassettes

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
as a limited edition,

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and then you read it to people.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
On TV.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, that's cool.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You know what's cool?

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nowadays, people make vinyl records,

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and those vinyl records come back,

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
because you have an audio player,

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and they play vinyl records,

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and then you make a cassette.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can be a bit more modern age.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Cassettes are still very popular today.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can be modern age,

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and start writing episodes

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
on 64 megabyte keys.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And throw them over the sea.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In a balloon.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
In a balloon,

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
so that there will be more democracy.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We have a serious topic.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We have to have a serious topic.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We still have minus three minutes,

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and then we have to get to work.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We have an easy topic for a start.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Kubernetes.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's a joke.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sure you don't care about Kubernetes.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can start a topic like that.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you think about Kubernetes?

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What do you think about Kubernetes?

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Can you read the trailer for the next one?

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We'll talk about Kubernetes in the next one.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What do you think about Kubernetes?

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's how it all starts.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
With Docker.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Have you ever looked up

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
what Kubernetes is on Google Docs?

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They don't troll you now.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And what is it about?

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It was a fight,

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
but that explains it.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why did they decide to do it

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
in such a way?

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It was an open puzzle.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Is that how it starts?

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, it was a fight

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
when they redid it.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But it looks good.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
For someone who has never seen

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
or heard of it,

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think it's a success.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How long does it take?

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Two parts.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Each part takes about 40 minutes.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's good.

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's double binge-watching.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Was it always connected

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
to Docker?

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No.

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They only had their part.

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Container, not Docker.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Container was replaced by Google.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Google was a container.

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There was no Docker.

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's all open now.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a different hack.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What did you say?

176
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Google worker.

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know what it is?

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Open Vista or Virtuoso.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's different.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Contemporary.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You could buy one,

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but you couldn't buy the other.

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How many servers did you need

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
for Kubernetes?

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
One.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
One single node.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
One Docker container.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How easy is it to start

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
playing with Kubernetes?

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
One Docker container.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's why you have

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Kubernetes, K and Docker.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
One Docker node.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How much WordPress site do you have?

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You name it.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It depends on how much

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
WordPress site you want to scale.

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It depends on how much

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
your provider is.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's say the biggest

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in Slovenia.

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In every datacenter

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you have a Kubernetes cluster

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and then you scale it

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
through all your datacenters.

207
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In Slovenia,

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
each location has

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
its own datacenter.

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Each bigger city.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I answered you.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You have to market it as a city.

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you can deploy

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kubernetes in your

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
physical datacenter,

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
then yes.

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How about WordPress?

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Can you deploy it?

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, you can't deploy it.

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you can deploy it,

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
you can deploy Kubernetes.

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No, you can't deploy it.

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why?

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Persistent databases

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
can be deployed in time.

227
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Not for ultra-production

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
high-value data,

229
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but it's better.

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Nodes can't have

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
more than 10 milliseconds

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
in Slovenia.

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let me tell you,

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
everything is possible,

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
but sometimes

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
you don't know

237
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
where to start.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's made for

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
a WordPress site

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
with an e-commerce

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
extension.

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you're the biggest

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
datacenter in Slovenia,

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you need a Kubernetes cluster

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
to start meeting

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and you have three nodes.

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Kubernetes,

248
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
MySQL,

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Postgres.

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What else did you forget?

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What else did you forget?

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That you have to physically

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
buy those three nodes.

254
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why?

255
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If you're going to complicate it,

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you're going to have to

257
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
do this and that.

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do you have any management ideas

259
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
for Kubernetes in Slovenia?

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The best.

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It just works faster.

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I like that.

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can even deploy it.

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If you take a physical cluster,

265
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
you can only have

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
a classic virtualization,

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
because nodes can only have

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
110 pods.

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's the first limitation.

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And then you need to have

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
something from the bottom,

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
a classic virtualization.

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But if you give that node

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
a large share of CPU...

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It doesn't matter,

276
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
as long as you have...

277
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean, as long as you have

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
a real Raspberry Pi,

279
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you're never going to exceed

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
110 pods on a physical hardware.

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's the first thing.

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
How can a large cluster

283
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
allow you to start playing

284
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
with Kubernetes

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and see benefits?

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Just one.

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It doesn't have to be just one.

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why not?

289
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can't put everything in one.

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I mean, I don't know why

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you're mentioning that.

292
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're killing the pod.

293
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Kubernetes is going to scale

294
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and you're going to run it again.

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can't do that.

296
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's the same answer

297
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
as in all distributed systems.

298
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You need at least three

299
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
to restart a node.

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And then,

301
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
just one.

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What distribution do you use

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
with Kubernetes?

304
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know.

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You can think of

306
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
a Rancher with SOS.

307
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'd take that one.

308
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not 3KS,

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it's small,

310
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
but it's enough.

311
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't know why

312
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you'd put Kubernetes

313
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
on your hardware.

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's crazy.

315
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It has no business value.

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's a micro-KS.

317
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It doesn't make sense.

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'd go for

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the development cluster.

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You have the K3S

321
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
from Rancher.

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's really nice.

323
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can manage

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
it with

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Google Cloud,

326
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Azure,

327
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
others.

328
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Open,

329
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
shift,

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
DigitalOcean,

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Linode, Vultr.

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Linode too?

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you're a normal

334
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Slovenian company,

335
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you can go to DigitalOcean,

336
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Linode, Vultr.

337
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you're already

338
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
on one cloud provider,

339
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
you stay there.

340
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you choose

341
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
from three big ones,

342
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you have Google.

343
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
K3S is

344
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
very complicated.

345
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know what's better.

346
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A bit of a puzzle.

347
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You need persistent storage.

348
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you're a provider,

349
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that's why you don't deploy

350
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
per se in the cluster.

351
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's already deployed.

352
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You need a distributed

353
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
storage

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
to install

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and maintain.

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How long will it take?

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Good luck.

358
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's one person.

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You buy appliance.

360
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You buy appliance.

361
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What's that Netgear?

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't know.

363
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
When they give you a case

364
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and you just open it.

365
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know if they have it.

366
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know.

367
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't know.

368
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You have to go from

369
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Synology

370
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
to QNAP and so on.

371
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But you don't know

372
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
how to do it.

373
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They give you

374
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
iSCSI.

375
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You look at

376
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
storage class,

377
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
iSCSI, blah, blah.

378
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What's the name?

379
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
CIF.

380
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's above.

381
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now we have

382
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Kubernetes cluster.

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We have

384
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
our own

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and we have

386
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
some of those offers.

387
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We have

388
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
documented tasks.

389
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What can we solve?

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
With WordPress.

391
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
With Svetlachar.

392
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Now we have

393
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Michael Cates.

394
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Michael Cates.

395
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Now we have to look at

396
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
developers.

397
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's amazing.

398
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
With FTP.

399
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you're a proper WordPress

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
deployer.

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's very complex.

402
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What did I study?

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If I had a team

404
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
of 10-20 engineers,

405
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I would be forced to

406
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
manage Kubernetes.

407
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is the only thing.

408
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I mean, you don't put it on yourself,

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you put it on Google

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
or on Linux,

411
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
on Vultr,

412
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
DigitalOcean,

413
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and then you have to manage

414
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Argo, CD, or Flux.

415
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So you get a UI

416
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and you can make

417
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
GitOps.

418
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You specify in the repository

419
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
what you want on the cluster.

420
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then the developers

421
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
interface,

422
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
configure in Kubernetes

423
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
so that they say

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know,

425
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't know,

426
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know.

427
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You put it in GitRip

428
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
so that if I want to run

429
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
this Docker container

430
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
with old replicas,

431
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
blah, blah, blah,

432
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I can put it in

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and have a nice UI

434
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
when you prepare it.

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because if you want to solve

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Airbag,

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
it's very complex.

438
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's go back.

439
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you want to copy files,

440
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
you have to do it this way.

441
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you want to deploy,

442
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you have to copy the files.

443
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Wait, really?

444
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's still very

445
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
debatable

446
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
for the use case.

447
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay.

448
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If you take

449
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
your engineering team

450
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that is on the line

451
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
deploying FTP,

452
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
SPTP,

453
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
whatever,

454
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
what is it good for?

455
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not good for you.

456
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's not good for you.

457
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's what worries me.

458
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You can see it in the diagram.

459
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
In M2U with Kubernetes,

460
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
if you press

461
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
99%

462
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you don't use it.

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You use it if you have...

464
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes, you use Kubernetes.

465
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If you have...

466
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If you have something

467
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that is really

468
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
non-persistent,

469
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you have to

470
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
scale it completely.

471
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You have jobs that can be different,

472
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
but

473
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
they run or don't run.

474
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you know why you use Kubernetes?

475
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know.

476
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Kubernetes is used too much

477
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because you want to use it

478
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
in production.

479
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's my main point.

480
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And then

481
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
because you have

482
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
so few systems

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
that would make it easier for you.

484
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You always have

485
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
a container in your hand

486
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and it works.

487
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's a load balancer.

488
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's the only open source

489
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
thing that survived

490
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the whole generation

491
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
that is Kubernetes based.

492
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You had Rancher

493
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
that was Docker Compose based

494
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and you had other providers

495
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
like Swarm.

496
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's why you said

497
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
you would use

498
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Docker or Container based

499
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
with Swarm.

500
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

501
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So you don't have to worry

502
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
about everything.

503
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, Swarm is still used.

504
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If you have Docker Compose

505
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
written,

506
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think there are

507
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
a few more signs

508
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that you can put

509
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
in the Swarm cluster.

510
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You have a black page

511
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WordPress, whatever.

512
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The first step is

513
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
to put it in a container.

514
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The second step is

515
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
to start using

516
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Docker Compose in production.

517
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No, you don't want to

518
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
put it in a container.

519
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Or Swarm.

520
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If you have to use

521
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Kubernetes,

522
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
if you have to use

523
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Docker,

524
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
then you have to

525
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
put it in a container.

526
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You can put it in a

527
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Heroku

528
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
or you can look

529
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
at Swarm or Nomad.

530
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Kubernetes is

531
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
very complex.

532
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If you want to have

533
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
dynamic number of nodes,

534
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
you have to have

535
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
3 fixed nodes

536
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
at all times.

537
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The load has to be

538
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
so low

539
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that you can't

540
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
put it in a container.

541
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If we talk about

542
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
nodes,

543
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
what does it mean?

544
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
How difficult is it

545
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
to put a node in a cluster?

546
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know.

547
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think it depends on

548
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the distribution.

549
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In the beginning,

550
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
you have to sign

551
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
on the master node

552
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and that's it.

553
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You copy the keys

554
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and that's it.

555
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You have to know

556
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
which nodes are which.

557
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I think the master node

558
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
knows about

559
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
workers.

560
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Nodes don't know

561
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
everything about themselves.

562
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
If you have a cluster

563
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
that is composed of nodes,

564
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
nodes are masters

565
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
or just workers,

566
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
then both can get

567
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
workloads.

568
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's the main process

569
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
that runs on a virtual

570
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
or hardware box.

571
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Typically,

572
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it's not a hardware box.

573
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Each node can have

574
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
110 nodes because of

575
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
networking.

576
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Typically,

577
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
you have 3 to 0

578
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
for production.

579
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
If you play,

580
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
you can have only one.

581
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's it.

582
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I would like to interview

583
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
a DevOps engineer

584
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
for a DevOps position.

585
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I can ask him

586
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
what is a good interview

587
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
to check

588
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
if someone will

589
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
manage it.

590
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It depends on what is written

591
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
in the CV.

592
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I typically check

593
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
if what is written is true.

594
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
How do you establish

595
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
a partner?

596
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What would you do

597
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
if you didn't have

598
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
a DevOps engineer?

599
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
If you didn't know

600
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
what a partner is,

601
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
what would you do?

602
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I think

603
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
if you really know

604
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
how to ask a question,

605
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
you have a path

606
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
that goes around

607
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and around.

608
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What would you look at?

609
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Where would you debug

610
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
the problem?

611
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's not that

612
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you want to see

613
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
the whole team

614
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
in a syntactic way,

615
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
but you need to understand

616
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
what to look at

617
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
from the description

618
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
to the service,

619
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the situation,

620
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
what is logical,

621
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and so on.

622
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you ask him

623
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
what is a service

624
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and what is a path?

625
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes.

626
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The question is

627
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
if you have an application

628
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
that is deployed on Kubernetes

629
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and you refresh the page,

630
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
when do you get

631
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
500 EUR

632
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and when do you get

633
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
200 EUR.

634
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What do you think

635
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
could be done?

636
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It depends on the level

637
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
of people you interview.

638
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The good thing is

639
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
if you want

640
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
a person

641
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
to understand

642
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the basics of Kubernetes,

643
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
yes,

644
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
you can learn a lot,

645
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
but if you want

646
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
a plug-and-play,

647
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the understanding

648
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
has to be high enough

649
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that it brings

650
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the basic business knowledge.

651
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The main problem

652
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
with Kubernetes

653
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
is that people

654
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
have to know a lot

655
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and then you ask

656
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
if it makes sense

657
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
for a small organization

658
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
to use this technology

659
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
because in the end

660
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
you get very little from it.

661
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Ok.

662
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If we look at this,

663
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
these are complex questions,

664
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
but

665
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
how many

666
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
of these

667
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
new age

668
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
infrastructure stacks

669
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and how many of these

670
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
stacks should be known

671
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
today?

672
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Where are the responsibilities

673
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
of engineering

674
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
or developers

675
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
or developer league?

676
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Do you think

677
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to what extent

678
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
should developers

679
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
understand

680
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Kubernetes

681
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and containers

682
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and where

683
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
should they prepare?

684
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't think that's the case.

685
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Do you think that developers really need to know this stuff?

686
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I think that if they are developing it, and you already have the development,

687
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I think that they need to include containers,

688
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and if a developer puts it on his laptop, in his docker,

689
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
then to some extent he needs to know the containers, and he needs to know the docker.

690
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Now it's just about overbuilding.

691
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Do developers need to know what are the requests, requirements, and limits for their workflows?

692
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
No, I don't think that's the case.

693
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The first thing, when it comes to organization,

694
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
the first thing you ask is what does DevOps mean for them.

695
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
In the beginning, in DevOps culture, developers don't need to understand

696
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
if there are nodes or not,

697
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and you have the right to deploy them on the cluster or in the namespace.

698
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
In my opinion, in the next point, you need to know that

699
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Helm nodes don't need to describe platform engineering or operations,

700
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
developers need to do it themselves,

701
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and it's good to have someone who knows Kubernetes better through that guide.

702
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And here's the next point again,

703
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
because people are used to deploying on some clusters,

704
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and they have SSH, and they say,

705
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
oh, Ansible is a more structured framework for SSH,

706
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and it's very useful,

707
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but people don't like it when I say we'll adopt Kubernetes

708
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
because it's a completely different thing,

709
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because it's much more complex,

710
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and it's also much more specific to the application.

711
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If you're an agency, you'll have a pattern,

712
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and you'll be dancing in the application,

713
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and if you're a customer, it's a bit more tricky.

714
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Simon is shocked.

715
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
No, I'm messing with Celina.

716
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Kubernetes will try to get through Celina.

717
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
These are really difficult topics for people.

718
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
They're not.

719
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What, Kubernetes?

720
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yes.

721
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I think it's a fully hype-driven technology,

722
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
everything that comes out of it.

723
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And if you want to be in this business, you have to know it.

724
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So the question is, if you're a person who wants to work on a platform,

725
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
or if you're in an engineering position,

726
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
then you have to learn it.

727
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If you know the technology, the circumstances,

728
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
is it the most reasonable for our space?

729
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't think so,

730
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
but if the whole caravan is in that direction,

731
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
then you have to go with that caravan,

732
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
as always.

733
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Thank you.

734
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
How would you advise the management?

735
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Look at the time.

736
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Look at the Kubernetes.

737
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Just don't do this.

738
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Kubernetes is recording,

739
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and it's pretty quickly closed.

740
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You'll always need someone to...

741
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Just a part of it won't be enough.

742
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's another problem.

743
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
If you're alone and you have some real products,

744
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Kubernetes is doing things pretty quickly.

745
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And then people say,

746
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
while we would have, I don't know,

747
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
canary releases,

748
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
then we would put 10% traffic on one release,

749
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and 90% on the other,

750
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and I would have my own deploy,

751
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and then you need two,

752
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and you're on 8-10 releases.

753
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And with one release,

754
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
it all works.

755
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes.

756
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Right?

757
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I mean...

758
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yes, it costs, but...

759
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes, but it's very undervalued.

760
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I mean, not 8 releases,

761
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
but 4 releases.

762
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes, people are like that.

763
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
People will say,

764
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
we pay 2 euros for each release,

765
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and that's very expensive.

766
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And then you have to pay for 2 euros.

767
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes, and now you have to pay for the frame.

768
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's a much better way.

769
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's that narrow-minded, you know,

770
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
that you're just looking at

771
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
one part of the price,

772
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
or one part of those accounts,

773
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and then you have to pay a lot of money for it,

774
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and in the superior part,

775
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the human factor is the health factor.

776
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yes.

777
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well,

778
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
in my opinion,

779
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
if you're a full-time Slovenian,

780
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and you're still looking at Swarm,

781
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
if you have a Docker Compose on 3 servers,

782
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and you want unmanageable,

783
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
then look at Swarm.

784
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Because it's still like Docker Inc,

785
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and then it's a much smoother transition,

786
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
if there are alternatives,

787
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and...

788
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
on the one hand,

789
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
you have to ask yourself,

790
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
do you really need it?

791
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We've also touched on a lot of things.

792
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Monitoring,

793
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
upgrading,

794
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
security,

795
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
a lot of things that still need to be done.

796
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, that's not relevant for a Slovenian company.

797
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Not relevant.

798
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We're just upgrading.

799
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, Kubernetes is a very complex airbag,

800
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and the environment is very complex,

801
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
but you don't have to worry about it.

802
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That's why these systems like Ergos, OCD, help you.

803
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So you can say,

804
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I want to have Google SSO,

805
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and people who are in a Google group,

806
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
developers,

807
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
can do that.

808
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Because otherwise,

809
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
you break down,

810
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
if you don't have that.

811
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Monitoring,

812
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
if there's something easier,

813
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
or something better,

814
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
than anywhere else.

815
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
A good thing,

816
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
maybe,

817
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
is that when the services run in the Kubernetes cluster,

818
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
they're more easily auto-discoverable.

819
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Because you have metadata,

820
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and it's easier to re-distribute the data.

821
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But if you're a Slovenian company,

822
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it doesn't have that much of a connection.

823
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What else was there?

824
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What else did we forget?

825
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Well, that's it.

826
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Okay.

827
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's it.

828
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Magically,

829
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
you don't cut your disaster recovery scenario.

830
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You can still ask in Kubernetes,

831
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
what you're going to do,

832
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
when you have one.

833
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
For that,

834
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
for a specific disaster recovery,

835
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
if you want.

836
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
For a disaster recovery.

837
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yes.

838
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay,

839
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
cost downtime,

840
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
if the disaster recovery,

841
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I don't know,

842
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
was good.

843
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
No,

844
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
it's not cost downtime,

845
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
it's cost losing of data.

846
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
In Slovenia,

847
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that has nothing to do with it.

848
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If you're an international company,

849
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
then you know what to do.

850
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We know.

851
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You know,

852
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
even if you're a Slovenian company,

853
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
your business is online,

854
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and you live from it,

855
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and you've done it,

856
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
shot in the foot,

857
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
by complicating your life so much.

858
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Can you calculate what that means?

859
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't know.

860
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That kind of downtime.

861
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We know examples,

862
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
where they lost a lot of data in Slovenia,

863
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and in the end,

864
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
no one got sick.

865
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Everything is custom-made,

866
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
one e-mail,

867
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and they don't feel it,

868
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but they feel they're in another country.

869
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But,

870
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
but,

871
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
but,

872
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
you know,

873
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
that no one got sick,

874
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
it's so interesting,

875
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
if you put it into numbers,

876
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and in some percentages,

877
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
no one knows you,

878
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
on your brand,

879
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
on the revenue,

880
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
that the company creates.

881
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Right?

882
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't know,

883
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I came here for a consultant,

884
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
who creates a specific revenue,

885
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
in the Slovenian market,

886
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and there,

887
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
you can calculate exactly

888
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
what that means,

889
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
one hour of downtime.

890
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Right?

891
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Right in the peaks,

892
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
when they were,

893
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't know,

894
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Valentinovo,

895
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Božić,

896
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
or Novljet,

897
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and so on.

898
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Right?

899
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So,

900
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
those managers,

901
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
or those leaders,

902
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
they know how to calculate.

903
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes.

904
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
In general,

905
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
you calculate

906
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
how much

907
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
one hour of downtime is,

908
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and you do a cost-benefit analysis,

909
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and if you save one hour of downtime,

910
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
you don't get sick.

911
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes.

912
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That's different.

913
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes,

914
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
in a nutshell,

915
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
let me put it this way,

916
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
in a nutshell,

917
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
probably,

918
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
that disaster recovery,

919
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
with that,

920
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
you know,

921
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
second best solution,

922
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
which can be totally static,

923
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
or even better,

924
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
when you restore,

925
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
or put back

926
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
the same complexity.

927
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yes,

928
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
disaster recovery

929
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
is a terrible,

930
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
expensive thing.

931
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It requires you

932
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
to take a pen,

933
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
write an essay,

934
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and look at basic tooling.

935
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It doesn't cost much.

936
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But,

937
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
what I want to say,

938
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
if Kubernetes,

939
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
if you think that

940
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Kubernetes gives you resiliency,

941
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
you still have to

942
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
make a mental effort,

943
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and write

944
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
what your disaster recovery

945
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
will look like,

946
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and test it,

947
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
every now and then,

948
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
let's say,

949
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
once every five years,

950
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
if you're a Slovenian startup.

951
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I just want to say,

952
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that technology

953
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
won't autoresolve

954
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
certain problems.

955
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
We're fucked.

956
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I know.

957
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We've heard a hard topic.

958
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm the first one.

959
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You're like a machine.

960
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Lp, bye-bye.

961
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yes.

962
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
When I listen to Jure,

963
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I have to say,

964
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
that if I listen to him,

965
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'll send him an email,

966
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
or something,

967
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't know.

968
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
No,

969
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm not going to send him

970
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
an email.

971
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm not going to send him

972
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
an email.

973
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm not going to send him

974
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
an email.

975
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That he listened to you.

976
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That he listened to you.

977
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That he listened to you.

978
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
He can write a message.

979
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yes.

980
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
If he does,

981
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
he'll write to me.

982
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He'll write to me.

983
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
He'll write to me.

984
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Or something.

985
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Or something.

986
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Are we going to work?

987
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We're going to work.

988
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And then we'll try

989
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Javascript,

990
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
or something.

991
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Or something.

992
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What are we going to try next?

993
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Tell me,

994
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
so that Jure will see.

995
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Something like ReactHook.

996
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Or something.

997
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What is it?

998
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
What is it?

999
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
He can come back.

1000
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
He can come back.

1001
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What is it?

1002
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Frontend technology,

1003
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
frontend technology.

1004
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And what is Javascript for?

1005
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
If we went full backend,

1006
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
maybe,

1007
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
are we going

1008
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
even lower in the backend?

1009
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Or are we going

1010
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
to work in engineering?

1011
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
A bit of engineering,

1012
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
a bit of recruitment,

1013
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and something like that.

1014
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Or are we going

1015
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
up the stack?

1016
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Let's say

1017
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
we're a developer,

1018
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
then we're going

1019
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
to containers,

1020
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
then applay,

1021
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
then security,

1022
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
then,

1023
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't know,

1024
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
performance,

1025
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
whatever.

1026
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Are we going

1027
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
up the stack,

1028
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
down the stack,

1029
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
left the stack,

1030
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
right the stack,

1031
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
right the stack,

1032
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
left the stack,

1033
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
right the stack.

1034
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think

1035
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm the only one

1036
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
talking.

1037
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Can you give us

1038
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
a more easy,

1039
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
a more fun

1040
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Javascript framework?

1041
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A fun one?

1042
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes,

1043
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Javascript framework.

1044
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Not just fun,

1045
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Javascript is

1046
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
something fun,

1047
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
whenever

1048
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm in touch

1049
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
with Javascript,

1050
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I always get

1051
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
a call.

1052
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We're going

1053
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
to link

1054
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
the scripts,

1055
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
we're going

1056
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
to put them out,

1057
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
we're going

1058
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
to ask people

1059
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
what they think

1060
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
about the topic,

1061
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
maybe we'll

1062
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
talk about it

1063
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
in games.

1064
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
In games.

1065
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Have you ever

1066
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
played a game

1067
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
with children?

1068
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
No,

1069
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
but I watched

1070
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Spiderman,

1071
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
the first

1072
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
time I watched

1073
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Spiderman.

1074
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
A movie?

1075
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A real movie

1076
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Spiderman.

1077
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The first,

1078
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
but the last.

1079
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The one

1080
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
with,

1081
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
not the

1082
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Spiderman

1083
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
adventure,

1084
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
whatever,

1085
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
the new generation,

1086
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the old generation,

1087
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
who

1088
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
plays

1089
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Green Goblin.

1090
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And?

1091
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And,

1092
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
you know,

1093
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
little kids

1094
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
climb up,

1095
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
climb up

1096
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
those buildings

1097
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and sit

1098
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
on Spiderman

1099
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and jump up.

1100
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't know,

1101
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
did I tell you

1102
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
to watch it?

1103
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I think you

1104
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
watched it

1105
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
in the process,

1106
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
but...

1107
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
There was no

1108
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Nobenga Joka.

1109
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No,

1110
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
no, no,

1111
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
there was Star

1112
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
4,

1113
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
yesterday

1114
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
was Star 6,

1115
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and you

1116
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
listened to it

1117
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and it was

1118
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
great.

1119
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And you have

1120
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
those two fingers

1121
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
on the top,

1122
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
you know,

1123
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
close up,

1124
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Spiderman

1125
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
on the top.

1126
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I liked that part

1127
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
a lot,

1128
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I liked it a lot,

1129
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and

1130
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I thought

1131
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
you were

1132
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
old enough

1133
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
to watch it,

1134
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
so it was

1135
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
cool.

1136
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Here.

1137
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Spiderman.

1138
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Spiderman.

1139
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Here,

1140
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
let's work.

1141
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Ok, let's work.

1142
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
If I do it now...

1143
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
We can't.

1144
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I didn't record,

1145
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
right?

1146
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I just recorded.

1147
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I didn't record,

1148
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
right?

1149
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I just recorded.

1150
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I just recorded.
