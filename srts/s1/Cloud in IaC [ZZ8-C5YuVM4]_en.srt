1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We can start with a fresh episode of Grodje, which we will dedicate today to a purely time-appropriate topic.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Today we will talk about trains, we will talk about infrastructure, we will talk about scaling, and we will try to focus on infrastructure as a whole.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today's episode will be more technical than the previous ones, and today we are alone with Andraž Brodnik, and we will go deep into the Jarek.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's say hello to everyone first.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was just thinking, what if I'm alone with you, and I can't do anything, and you can box me into the frame.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello everyone!

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now we will try to make two episodes, so that we can talk about it.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
First, we will talk about the cloud, what is happening with it, why is it a cloud, and we will go deeper into IOC.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now, around the cloud itself, the infrastructure, operators, orchestrators, etc., we can have more episodes.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, have a little patience watching this.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But yeah, I was focusing on IOC today.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Andraž is nodding nicely.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And now, I was thinking, when I was preparing for this episode, if we are going to talk about this topic, it is very important that at the beginning we set up some credibility,

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:32,000
so that we can tell people why we came up with this topic, or where we came up with this story.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, maybe one of the easier ways is to go back to the beginning, so that you can tell what you started at the beginning,

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
how did you start with the infrastructure, how did you start with Linux, how did you set up your first server,

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
so that we can make a parallel of how the world changed.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And maybe if we go back in time, we will be able to describe what was the situation at that time, what were the demands at that time, and what the world was like.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, let's start there.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, my first question regarding this topic is, where did you start with Deops, or system engineering?

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where is your beginning in this area, and we will try to talk about it later.

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is a very good question.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In the early 2000s, there was a wide spread of Internet in Slovenia, or it was available for the end user.

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And at that time I decided that the router we had was not as good as it was, or I wanted to understand how networking works,

25
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and that led to the fact that I bought, for 10,000 dollars, an old Dell Pentium 3 or 4, and an additional network card.

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And then I followed the lead, I remember, from Choker, Forum, Nenjalnik, how to make a router out of an old case.

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Something like that.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And then I copied the instructions in Dummy to Windows via SSH, and configured it.

29
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But what about your server? Did you already download it from CD, or from floppy disk?

30
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, no, it was already in CD.

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, it was already in CD.

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, I remember, this case already had some CD notes, but I know that I could update it with floppy disk,

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
because there were some problems with adding those PCIe networks.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So my first home router was...

35
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Something like 386, 486?

36
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, it was Pentium 3, Pentium 4.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, that was already...

38
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, yes, I think there were 2 or 4.

39
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know that there was a bed, an old desktop machine, and on top of that I had a cathode monitor.

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ah, ok, that's why.

41
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Because the LCDs were so...

42
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Rare, right?

43
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes, you could take a look at it, but it was so expensive that I didn't have a lot of money,

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so now that we have them, you don't know where you're going to mount those two.

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, yes, that's how I started.

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How did you start?

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You set up a router, that's how you started.

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes, yes, actually...

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, I don't know what exactly happened with IPTables.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But you didn't have the intention of setting up a web server or something?

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, no, I was actually most interested in...

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ok, I'm interested in how IPv4 works.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I mean, I was like, ok, that's pretty simple at first, and then you can play around with it a bit.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then you realize that some concepts are so hard to understand.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
To understand.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because I still have to think about it a lot of times, I've done it a hundred times already, just like at the end of the month.

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How to work on it, or, well, it's basically just a path, up and down, up and down, and...

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I also had a fear of terminals, and that was a long time ago.

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Even when I joined CyberPig.

60
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
When you're so black, and you can't write anything.

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, it's like...

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But it's interesting that you said that you connected with WindowsBox,

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
on the machine you set up, or something.

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, I've already done that a bit.

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you didn't directly set it up?

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I did, I did.

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I mean, I used to be on these frozen boards, but it wasn't that convenient.

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'd go to an old recording studio and watch concerts.

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And then, after a month or so, I think, I figured out that a path exists.

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And it lasted like that, it was like that.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I built an old router, which was this GL,

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and I hacked it while everyone else was watching TV.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
At the time, TV was still an analog satellite, and terrestrial,

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
so you didn't need the internet for that.

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And then I hacked it again, because it didn't work.

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And then I hacked it for so long that it didn't start working,

77
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and it lasted like that for six weeks.

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And you...

79
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now, for a beginner at that time,

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and it's probably the same for us,

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and especially in the Linux space,

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
do people connect with distributors?

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you connect with distributors?

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, you just...

85
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When you're a noob, you don't have strong feelings about things.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And what did you do when you, for example,

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
fucked up the system and went to format everything?

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, no, you couldn't destroy it like that.

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Basically, all that happened was

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that you hacked the firewall so much

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that your whole configuration went to shit.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That you locked yourself out.

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, but that wasn't a problem.

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I went under the table, but behind me was a domain

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that I could destroy as much as possible.

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You didn't see the firewall,

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and some things didn't happen at the time

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
that would hide the system so much

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
that you wouldn't see it.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That was the beginning of the fax,

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
because I hacked it so much,

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and then the news.

103
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
How did you start?

104
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I prepared myself,

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I went to investigate a little

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
when it was that I played with those things myself,

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
when I started playing with those things.

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And that was also a step

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
before the break of 2000,

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and around 2000,

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and for illustration at that time

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
PHP 4.0 was used,

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
for example, it was at that time.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And that was also a breakthrough year,

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and around that year

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Apache 2.x came out.

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think these are the major versions

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
of those two softwares.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I played a lot with Linux Slackware,

120
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and that was like,

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
okay, debugging packages,

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
that's already done,

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
what's more hardcore than that?

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And then I played with Slackware.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And Slackware at that time,

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think this distribution still exists,

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but it's like,

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Linux kernel,

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
some basic bash,

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
tooling,

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think it's also a compiler,

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I didn't talk about it,

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
getCB is healthy,

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but this thing worked like this,

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you pulled down from the Internet

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Apache source code,

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
PHP source code,

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
then you could,

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
or even if you had less SQL,

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you could pull down less SQL,

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but that was the most popular combo.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then you could first compile,

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think PHP,

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and then you could compile Apache,

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
extension,

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
compiled everything.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And that was compiled in a couple of hours.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And if you forgot a flag,

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you could compile it again,

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and then you got those binaries.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was much more into that,

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
before I realized,

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
oh, look,

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
debugging packages,

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and RPM packages,

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and all that.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Those were some of the experiments.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
At some point,

159
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I tried everything,

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
from Fedora,

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
to Red Hat Linux,

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to SUSE Linux,

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to the shorter Ubuntu,

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think there were a lot,

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
but mostly I tried all those

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
different distributions,

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I pulled most of them down,

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
then I played,

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and when I got bored,

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I deleted them all together,

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and I became lazy.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And I also tried those BSDs,

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD,

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
so I played a lot with those systems.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think I worked on a desktop,

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then,

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
when I knew a bit more about PHP,

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I worked on a lot of split pages,

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and when I learned about SlashDiag,

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
then I earned some cash

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
through the diag part,

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and then,

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
after two years,

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I bought my first server,

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and it was a part of ESC,

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know what,

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and I also got a playground

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for experimentation,

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and I worked on a page,

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and then I hosted them,

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
or I hosted others,

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and those were my beginnings

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
with infrastructure,

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I realized then,

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that if I wanted to work

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
on a page,

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I had to live somewhere,

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and if you know how to layer it,

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
it's easier to do it from the bottom.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I wasn't interested in

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
some nat-type of firewall,

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and I never really struggled with that,

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and I also hosted an FTP server,

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and an IRT server,

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and I played around with those.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Now, I'll give you a bit of context,

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I went to look around a bit,

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and when we talk about

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
2022,

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in those areas,

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
maybe,

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the internet

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
was around 300-350 million

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
users back then.

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
For example,

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
in the year 2022,

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
there were almost

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
5 billion users

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
of the internet,

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and 62%

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
of the population

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
on Earth

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
has access to the internet.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So,

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the world in which

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
we both started,

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the world in which

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
we both started,

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
was such that

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
if a neighbor saw your page,

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
it was already big,

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and people didn't really know

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
what to do with it,

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
plus those geographical challenges,

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and now,

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
fast forward,

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
today,

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
there are more expectations,

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
more users,

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and in a way,

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
there was a lot of luck

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
that there weren't so many users

243
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and that you could play,

244
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and there weren't any expectations

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
from the people who looked at the page,

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that everything would snap together.

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah, I don't know,

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
when I look back,

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
there are three more things

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that I remember very well.

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I remember that traffic light

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
when you started MySQL

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
on Windows,

254
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
there was such a traffic light

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that people thought

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
that you weren't working,

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
because they thought

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
that you were working,

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and then when you set up

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
PHP, BBForum,

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you were very happy

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that you were working,

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and then you thought,

264
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
okay, I'm the biggest

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
king in the world now.

266
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's a memory

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
that was very funny to me.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then I remember

269
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
when I applied

270
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and I was on duty,

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I could get into

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
all those computers

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
very quickly,

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
because they were

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
in one code,

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and they actually

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
booted from the LAN,

278
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
but at that time

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
it wasn't like that.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I mean, smartphones

281
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
came out very quickly,

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and it was just

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
a different time.

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
People actually

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
didn't know that.

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
When you applied

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
for that particular job,

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
did you apply randomly

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
or did you intend to work?

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Very randomly.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I just wanted to do something

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
that was connected

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
to technology,

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and then,

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
because it was a factory,

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the queue was already

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
very low at that time,

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
it was about two and a half.

299
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And then,

300
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I remember

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that one question

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
was the best

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
question for the job ever.

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There were predetermined

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
answers to almost

306
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
all the questions,

307
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
but one was just

308
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
for the job.

309
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I mean, a game hadn't

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
come out yet,

311
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and then you could

312
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
circle around it

313
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
for the job.

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You could always install

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
a distribution at home

316
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
or at your neighbor's,

317
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
or something like that.

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So,

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
one of the reasons

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that I was more

321
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
comfortable with

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
building things

323
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
was because I had

324
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
been maintaining

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
a lot of things

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
for so many years.

327
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This last memory

328
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
comes to mind

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
when I was at Krimp.

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
At that time,

331
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
if you had capital

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
or cash,

333
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you went to the store

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and bought short

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Ethernet cables

336
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to solder switches

337
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
to each other.

338
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We probably didn't have

339
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
that much cash at the time.

340
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I remember that

341
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
at Krimp I had

342
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
60 cables,

343
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and you had to put them

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
into a connector.

345
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You had to look at it

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and solder it,

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and I had a bloody hand

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
one day.

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I remember that

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
because it seemed

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
really funny to me.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I hope you like it

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
when you play Krimp.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well,

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that was a trip down

356
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the memory lane.

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If I can go back

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to the beginning,

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
why did I choose

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
this building?

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I really liked it

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
because the systems

363
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
that worked

364
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
allowed people

365
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
to access the system,

366
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
the pages,

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the media,

368
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and people could see

369
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
what you were doing.

370
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You could get tools

371
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
to help people.

372
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I had this feeling

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that I created a webpage

374
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and people could work with it.

375
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Unbelievable.

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
There was one guy

377
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
with a new gun

378
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and a shotgun.

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That was it.

380
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Now,

381
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you are a certified

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Google Cloud Engineer,

383
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
right?

384
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes,

385
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Cloud Architect.

386
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Now it's gone,

387
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
but I did

388
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
that certification.

389
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you also work

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
for AWS?

391
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't know how many

392
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
you have.

393
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
For AWS,

394
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I could only write

395
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and go.

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I used to say

397
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that

398
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
those certifications

399
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
are useless.

400
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
On the other hand,

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
when I started working,

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I realized

403
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
that they are useful

404
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
because

405
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you would never

406
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
go through

407
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
all those things

408
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
if you didn't have

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
a curriculum.

410
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Some things are useless,

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but a lot of them

412
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
are.

413
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Before that,

414
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I would do it

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
custom.

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I like the fact

417
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
that all those things

418
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
are useful

419
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
when you study for it.

420
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you want to save it

421
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
through a certification?

422
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Do you want to go

423
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and do it?

424
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If you do

425
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
a certification

426
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
for Google Cloud

427
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
or AWS,

428
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
do you think

429
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
it's easier

430
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
to do it for others?

431
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If you study for it.

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
it's easier.

434
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If you establish

435
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the basics of

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
networking,

437
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
cloud,

438
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
deployment,

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
containers,

440
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and then you study

441
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
for AWS.

442
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
On the one hand,

443
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
if you know Italian

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and it's easier

445
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to learn Spanish,

446
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
yes,

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but you have to be careful

448
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
not to think about

449
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
words

450
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
if you really want

451
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
to know it well.

452
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But I don't know

453
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
how...

454
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Even if the things

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
are different,

456
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
you have a reference point.

457
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you say

458
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that networking

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
in Google Cloud

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
is more loose,

461
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
if you study

462
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
for AWS,

463
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
you have that kind of

464
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
network.

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I used it before,

466
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but I didn't

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
think about it

468
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that much.

469
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
On a very

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
professional level,

471
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
you think

472
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that it's more

473
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
strict.

474
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
how you separate

476
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
two projects

477
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
so that

478
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
in Google Cloud

479
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and in AWS

480
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
it's different,

481
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
but if you know

482
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
how,

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
let's say,

484
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Google does it

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
quite simply

486
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and I think

487
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
it's good,

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
then in AWS

489
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
you can think

490
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
about it

491
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
more.

492
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Will it be a

493
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
low-cost

494
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
AWS account?

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Will there be

496
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
GitHub Organizations?

497
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You can take

498
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
all the roles

499
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
as those

500
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
you use

501
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
because

502
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
things are

503
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
a bit different,

504
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
but it helps you

505
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
a lot

506
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
because you have

507
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
a reference point

508
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
where you can say

509
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
this is different

510
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
with this part.

511
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's always easier

512
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
because you don't

513
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
have any of that.

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I think it's

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
quite fast.

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I mean,

517
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it's not ultra-trivial

518
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
to say

519
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I did GCP

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and in a month

521
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'll have AWS.

522
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not like that,

523
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
but it's easier

524
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
for you.

525
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
For managers

526
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
who listen

527
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
or entrepreneurs

528
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
who have

529
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
programmers,

530
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
would you consider

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
sending your

532
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
system,

533
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
CDO,

534
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
or engineers

535
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
to these

536
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
tasks?

537
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you think

538
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
if they know

539
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
more about

540
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
cloud

541
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
or if

542
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
they go

543
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
through

544
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
certification

545
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
or courses,

546
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
do you think

547
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
they will

548
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
use

549
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
those

550
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
cloud offerings

551
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
better?

552
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Because of

553
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
less reinventing

554
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and more

555
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
use of

556
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
those resources?

557
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think

558
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
it's

559
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
very important

560
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
that

561
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
if you're

562
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
at the beginning

563
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
of your career,

564
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
it's important

565
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
because you'll

566
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
learn a lot

567
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
because you

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
don't have

569
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
a lot of knowledge

570
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and if you have

571
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
it will

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
help you a lot.

576
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
In the end,

577
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
you'll get

578
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000

582
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's not

583
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
that important.

584
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If you're

585
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000

586
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000

it's

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000

you

system

731
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's already quite robust, and this is a very important premise.

732
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's a very important word outside of technological affairs.

733
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If you're in the commercial sector, and you want to have...

734
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I mean, what is the set of people you need, it's harder without it.

735
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Let's give this connection to people who may not know.

736
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If we're talking about entry-level certification, engineering certification, courses,

737
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
does it cost, I don't know, 20,000 euros, 100,000 euros?

738
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What is the price range of these certificates?

739
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's a good question.

740
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Google has a deal with Coursera,

741
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and for education you pay around 45 euros per month,

742
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and they've allowed you to use Google's website for educational purposes.

743
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
They've found a good place for it.

744
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Then, I think the certification was around 200 euros.

745
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You need to write it in an exam center.

746
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
In Ljubljana, it's around 3 euros,

747
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
but you can also do it online,

748
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
but because of the coronavirus, it changes a bit.

749
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
In Ljubljana, you typically have to write it somewhere,

750
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
but here you have time.

751
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
For AWS, it's nothing special.

752
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
In Slovenia, there are offers for business training,

753
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
there are also mixed offers,

754
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
where you have to prepare for a certificate,

755
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
where they guide you through things.

756
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's also really good.

757
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
They tell you this, this, and this,

758
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
but it's also documentation that you need to go through.

759
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Some things will be more interesting,

760
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
others will be less interesting,

761
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but if you cover the same base,

762
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and if you're really interested,

763
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
you also get a little extra money.

764
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You don't do it because someone told you to.

765
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Or, you know...

766
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You have to look at it as an open documentation.

767
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes, but when I pay for it myself,

768
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
it's a child's expense,

769
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and you look at it differently.

770
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
In the end, the certificate doesn't matter.

771
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's more about me doing a better job.

772
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's more like I'm doing more business

773
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
on the software as a service,

774
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
rather than doing it on my own.

775
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
There are similar prices on AWS,

776
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
from 200 euros.

777
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
For someone who's a student,

778
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
it's relatively expensive,

779
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
but if you're in a business,

780
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
if someone wants to do it,

781
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
it's not that expensive.

782
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
At least, I don't think so.

783
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
In these conversations,

784
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
we'll call it biased,

785
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
but we also have Azure Cloud,

786
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Oracle Cloud,

787
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
smaller offers,

788
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
cloud technology,

789
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and also hosting.

790
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I would say that there are similar problems.

791
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I don't have exact information,

792
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
so it's a bit difficult to talk about it

793
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
in this episode,

794
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
but I think it's very similar.

795
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You also get badges and certificates for Azure.

796
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
They also have very good courses,

797
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and you can get everything.

798
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I have one more question,

799
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
just to sum it up,

800
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
because I think it's interesting.

801
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Who pays for the hosting

802
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
that you need to be able to play?

803
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Who pays for the credit?

804
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Where do you get the money

805
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to be able to play half a day

806
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
on these clouds?

807
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
To do a lab?

808
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That's a great question.

809
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
There are different strategies.

810
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Google Cloud will make your account

811
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
in the first 12 months

812
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
with a 300-euro budget,

813
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
which you can spend,

814
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and they will pay for it.

815
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Most of the time,

816
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
for self-education,

817
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the costs of daily infrastructure

818
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
are especially low.

819
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So, I don't know,

820
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
everything I did,

821
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I did it on my own credit,

822
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and not at the end,

823
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to make a lab.

824
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
There are a lot of people

825
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
who are educated,

826
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
who have specialized offers,

827
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
who have a contract

828
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
with cloud providers,

829
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and in the end,

830
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
you get a lab.

831
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's a laboratory environment,

832
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and it's on-demand.

833
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You make a loan,

834
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
they give you a username and password,

835
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and literally,

836
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
you get the environment,

837
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and you click there,

838
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and the lab also has a check

839
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
at the back,

840
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
if you clicked it correctly.

841
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
They give you a logo,

842
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
you click it,

843
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and then they verify

844
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
if you did it correctly.

845
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If the resources are there.

846
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So, most of the time,

847
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it's all included

848
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
in the education itself,

849
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
so you don't have to

850
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
pay extra for it.

851
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay.

852
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Phew, we're warmed up.

853
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Are you comfortable?

854
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's warm.

855
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay, let's talk

856
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
a little bit more

857
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
about

858
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
how we

859
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
actually came

860
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to these clouds.

861
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's a good question.

862
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Actually, I don't know,

863
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
20 years ago,

864
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
you had a server,

865
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and it was your box,

866
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and there was one box.

867
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Why did we come to the cloud?

868
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What's the path

869
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
that we are

870
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
full of clouds today?

871
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Why do we need these clouds?

872
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Give me a reason.

873
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Why do you think

874
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
there's a need for

875
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
a host, for example?

876
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I would say

877
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
it's a natural evolution.

878
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Not all firms are

879
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
technology-first firms,

880
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
which means that if you want

881
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to have a storage thing,

882
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
it doesn't make much sense,

883
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
if you're too small,

884
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
to have a server

885
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
in the middle of a desk

886
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
at your feet.

887
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Let's say you're an average

888
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
middleman.

889
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
At some point,

890
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
in the mid-2000s,

891
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I think everyone needed

892
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
a server, and then

893
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
you could have

894
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
some equipment, and of course,

895
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
there were offers.

896
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
They bought storage units,

897
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
gave them away, amortized them,

898
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and offered it as

899
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
a monthly payment.

900
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Most of the time, it looked like

901
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
you had to virtualize it.

902
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You called a secret firm

903
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
on the phone or e-mail,

904
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and you said,

905
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
we would transfer the virtual

906
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
with this and that spec,

907
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
this and that disk,

908
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and then someone had

909
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
more or less than

910
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
one of us,

911
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and a security guard,

912
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and he calculated

913
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
that the amortization process

914
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
was going to take a while,

915
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
or maybe not.

916
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And now,

917
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
people are calling,

918
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
sending e-mails,

919
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
it's fluid,

920
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
you simply have

921
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
split portals,

922
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
where you can click on it,

923
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
make an order,

924
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
send it back,

925
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
the most typical,

926
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I don't know,

927
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
you want hosting,

928
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
localalpha.php,

929
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
ok, cool, you have that.

930
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Then, at some point,

931
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
it started to happen that

932
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
above that,

933
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
what if people want

934
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
to access it

935
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
through APIs,

936
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
it means that

937
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
now everything is RESTful,

938
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
but at the time, it wasn't RESTful,

939
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
you had SOAP, or Remote Procedure Call,

940
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
in XML,

941
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and everything was set by a server,

942
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and that's how

943
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
it all started,

944
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
once you have an API

945
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
that can manage your infrastructure,

946
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
everything is done

947
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
through Cloud.

948
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That's the

949
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
local version,

950
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
how we got into it.

951
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
In practice, I don't know,

952
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
AWS started with SQS,

953
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
which was very useful for them,

954
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
then they started to implement it as a storage,

955
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and then they added

956
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Compute Engine,

957
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and Google started to...

958
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Now we'll stop.

959
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You went too fast.

960
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's all cool.

961
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Let's go back a bit.

962
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Why do you want to be a company

963
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
with your own hardware?

964
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I mean, you can have it,

965
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
but it doesn't mean anything.

966
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Why do you want to be a company

967
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
with your own hardware?

968
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
What are good reasons

969
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
to buy your own servers,

970
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to set up your own

971
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
data center?

972
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Good reasons are

973
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
if you really need

974
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
regulation,

975
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I don't think you need

976
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
it because of regulation,

977
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
but if you really need

978
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
your own hardware,

979
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that's one option.

980
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Another option is

981
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
if you really need

982
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
a lot of data,

983
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and you need

984
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
low latency,

985
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
if you're doing video editing,

986
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and you need

987
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
a video production company,

988
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
then it's important

989
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
to have a server.

990
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
On the other hand,

991
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't know,

992
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
we're almost there.

993
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There are a lot of

994
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
special things.

995
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
If you have your own hardware.

996
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes, or if you have

997
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
an infrastructure,

998
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I mean, you're an industry,

999
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and if someone has

1000
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
a Java app,

1001
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
you won't be able to cloud it.

1002
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's like a box.

1003
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You have two identical boxes,

1004
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and you put them together.

1005
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
These are industrial special things.

1006
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's a waste of knowledge.

1007
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Or I don't know.

1008
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yes, audio production is the same.

1009
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Low latency is very important.

1010
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Why is it a waste of knowledge?

1011
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's because

1012
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
you need to have

1013
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
a good environment.

1014
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
If you're a woman,

1015
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the environment is even better.

1016
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Then it's a bit hotter,

1017
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and you need air conditioning.

1018
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Then you need more hormones,

1019
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and you have an electricity problem.

1020
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Then you have to amortize everything.

1021
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You buy everything,

1022
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and you have everything.

1023
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You have to pay for the internet.

1024
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yes, you have to pay for the internet.

1025
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Then you realize

1026
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
that this equipment

1027
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
is computer-amortized,

1028
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
but at some point

1029
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
you realize

1030
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
that more electricity

1031
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
gives you more compute power.

1032
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You have to think about

1033
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
what you want to have.

1034
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
In the future?

1035
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Typically, you will have a problem

1036
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
that it is inefficient

1037
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
before the future.

1038
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If you are extremely big,

1039
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
if you are a very big company,

1040
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
you will have to

1041
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
listen to the public.

1042
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
From the cloud,

1043
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the first thing you take down

1044
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
are databases and data,

1045
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
because you want to have them up.

1046
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You typically put computing up,

1047
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
but there are

1048
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
more advanced things.

1049
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You need to get

1050
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
more of the classic things

1051
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
that are everywhere.

1052
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
They have flexibility,

1053
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you don't have to

1054
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
have an additional server,

1055
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
you don't have the problem

1056
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
to call the provider

1057
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and say that your datacenter

1058
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
has no more disk space,

1059
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
no more RAM slots.

1060
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It might seem

1061
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
bizarre to someone

1062
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
who is already working

1063
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
with Ethereum,

1064
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
because it is unlimited.

1065
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Sometimes you call them

1066
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and they tell you

1067
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
that they don't need more disk space.

1068
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What are you going to do next?

1069
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It is difficult.

1070
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The other bizarreness

1071
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
is that you are

1072
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
an e-commerce platform

1073
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and you have 100 pages

1074
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
with 100 domains

1075
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
on different providers,

1076
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you register them,

1077
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
you decide that you are

1078
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
very smart and you will

1079
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
switch to DNS.

1080
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
When registering,

1081
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
for example, if you want to sell

1082
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
sour milk,

1083
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
they will write your IP address

1084
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
where your DNS server is.

1085
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
How are you going to switch

1086
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
when you have 100 people

1087
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
who are not technology experts

1088
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
who have registered the domain

1089
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
to be able to switch

1090
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the location of the server?

1091
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
There are a lot of things.

1092
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I forgot one more thing.

1093
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
If you have hardware,

1094
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you need people

1095
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
who will physically

1096
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
go to the hardware

1097
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and maybe change the disk,

1098
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
upgrade it,

1099
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
patch it.

1100
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Let's say in Slovenia

1101
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you get a disk on Friday

1102
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
at 2 p.m.

1103
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
When will you be able to buy a new disk?

1104
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It is said that at least on Tuesday.

1105
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Good luck.

1106
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean, you have to know

1107
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
vendors and logists

1108
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
in a special way

1109
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
to be able to switch.

1110
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There are a lot of bizarreness

1111
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
that I have encountered

1112
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and they are very fluid

1113
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
to the point

1114
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
that they are

1115
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
even more fluid.

1116
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think that

1117
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
if we talk about compliance,

1118
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
if you want to cut

1119
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
data in Slovenia,

1120
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
then you can do it

1121
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
by yourself or by a Slovenian vendor.

1122
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Please, do it

1123
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
with a Slovenian vendor

1124
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
if you expect good support,

1125
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
which will be better than

1126
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
if you try to get it

1127
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
from someone on the phone.

1128
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But

1129
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
when a compliance

1130
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
requires 24-hour

1131
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
security for a person,

1132
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
then you

1133
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
can't afford it.

1134
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I hear a lot of times

1135
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
that we can't have it

1136
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
because there are some regulations.

1137
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It would be much easier

1138
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
to give the risk to someone

1139
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and they will pay you

1140
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
for

1141
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
ISO 27000X

1142
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
or SOC 2

1143
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
or...

1144
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't know.

1145
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I know that there must be

1146
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
a registry and some data.

1147
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It doesn't make much sense

1148
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
to have it on paper

1149
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
if you really want it,

1150
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
but you can't afford it.

1151
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Did I forget anything else?

1152
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That's all I wanted to say.

1153
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I hear a lot of times

1154
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
maybe a little less now,

1155
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
but

1156
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
reliability.

1157
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Reliability.

1158
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I mean...

1159
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
How do I put it?

1160
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Even clouds are not silver bullets

1161
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and they are 100% reliable

1162
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and I don't know what else.

1163
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Local data centers

1164
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
are not 100% reliable either.

1165
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
None of those solutions

1166
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
are 100%

1167
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
silver bullets.

1168
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Even S3

1169
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
is

1170
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
endless, I don't know what else.

1171
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But it's not

1172
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
100% reliable.

1173
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It has some 999

1174
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
reliability.

1175
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't know.

1176
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Do you also have

1177
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
a view of the world

1178
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
where...

1179
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
How should I put it?

1180
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Reliability is a very complex thing.

1181
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But the most basic way

1182
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
is...

1183
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If you're in telecommunications

1184
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
those 9 or energy

1185
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
are very important because it's a critical infrastructure

1186
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
for...

1187
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You can also buy a station

1188
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and your station

1189
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
when you have it in the office

1190
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and the data center

1191
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
can draw

1192
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and this event

1193
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
can happen.

1194
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Now...

1195
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It depends on

1196
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
your business model

1197
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
if you want to cover it or not.

1198
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
In both cases.

1199
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
If you're a startup, even if you have everything in the cloud

1200
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
or locally, in both cases

1201
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you won't have a backup.

1202
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
If you're

1203
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
a proper

1204
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
company

1205
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
it's more likely that you'll have it.

1206
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But you can have it in both cases.

1207
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Then you have

1208
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
some special use cases

1209
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
that are products that rely

1210
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
heavily on infrastructure.

1211
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You'll look at these percentages

1212
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and calculate

1213
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
how much theoretical output

1214
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
there is.

1215
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You'll know the difference

1216
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
between the 5th place

1217
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and the 7th.

1218
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I would say that

1219
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
practically

1220
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
the cloud

1221
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
is more reliable.

1222
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It happened to me as well.

1223
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You get a daily event

1224
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and it's hard to find it.

1225
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It's gone.

1226
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's gone.

1227
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's not a problem

1228
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and it happened to me

1229
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
once in my entire career.

1230
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I won't go

1231
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
deeper into this

1232
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
because we'll get

1233
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
into it later.

1234
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Can you tell me

1235
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
some types of

1236
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
computations

1237
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
inside

1238
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
the cloud?

1239
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Can you tell me

1240
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the differences between the 3 models?

1241
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'll give you the first one.

1242
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You tell me.

1243
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Let's start

1244
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
with the computations.

1245
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Tell me what does

1246
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
IAAS mean.

1247
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
We can start

1248
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
with the index.

1249
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
IAC stands for

1250
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Infrastructure.

1251
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
PA stands for

1252
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Platform.

1253
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
SAS stands for

1254
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Service.

1255
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Infrastructure,

1256
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Platform

1257
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and Service.

1258
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Infrastructure is

1259
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
a typical way

1260
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
for small teams

1261
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
to consume

1262
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
in Slovenia's cloud.

1263
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You go to AWS

1264
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
which has a large dashboard

1265
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and you click on

1266
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
4 virtual machines

1267
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and so many disks.

1268
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You also get

1269
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
implicit default networking.

1270
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You're very lucky

1271
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and it reminds you

1272
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
of the times when you

1273
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
only had VMWare

1274
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
virtual machines.

1275
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
These machines

1276
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
are quite complex

1277
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
but typically you can

1278
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
think of disks,

1279
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
networking

1280
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and virtual machines.

1281
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
These are typical examples.

1282
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And when I have

1283
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
4 boxes and I need

1284
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
the 5th one, what do I do?

1285
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You click on it.

1286
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You have roughly

1287
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
3 options.

1288
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You go to the dashboard,

1289
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
click on it,

1290
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
you get one.

1291
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Or you use a special tool

1292
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
which will

1293
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
if there are not 5 of them

1294
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
it means there will be 5.

1295
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
If there are 6,

1296
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
there will be one less.

1297
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Platform as a service?

1298
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Platform as a service is like this.

1299
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You're a developer

1300
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and you know

1301
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
you have PHP

1302
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and you need

1303
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
a MySQL database

1304
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and then

1305
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
you use a framework

1306
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
let's say WordPress

1307
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and then you write a file

1308
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
which is PHP

1309
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
entry point

1310
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
it depends on the implementation

1311
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
or the language

1312
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
how it's implemented.

1313
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's called an index

1314
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
it depends if it's conventional

1315
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
or not.

1316
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And then it will say

1317
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
that you need

1318
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
a database

1319
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and you give it to yourself

1320
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
you say deploy

1321
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and it magically happens.

1322
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's the same with

1323
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Python

1324
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
your provider

1325
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
supports certain languages

1326
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and you tell

1327
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
in which bucket

1328
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
what your language is

1329
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and you get a dashboard

1330
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
where the app is running

1331
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
you have a logo

1332
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
you can restart the app

1333
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
and then it depends

1334
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
it can also be a non-activity

1335
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
if you don't have a package

1336
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
it will be through an app

1337
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and typical examples are

1338
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Heroku

1339
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Google

1340
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Engine

1341
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Google App Engine

1342
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
or Beanstalk

1343
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
and it's great

1344
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
if you're a beginner

1345
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
and you just want to deploy something

1346
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
you download it in Heroku

1347
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and then you write

1348
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Python or Flask app

1349
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and you deploy it

1350
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
but as a programmer

1351
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
as a user

1352
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
you don't deal with

1353
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
a virtual machine

1354
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
you don't deal with networking

1355
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
firewalls, breakups

1356
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
you end up

1357
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
with an IP

1358
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
and because those things

1359
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
are abstracted

1360
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
from you

1361
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
those providers can give you

1362
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
certain cool bonuses

1363
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
like if you want to revert

1364
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
to another deploy

1365
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
or if you want to have

1366
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
two deploys

1367
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and 99% of the traffic

1368
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
goes to the old one

1369
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and it helps you

1370
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
with the new version

1371
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
for example

1372
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
in Canary

1373
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
you have

1374
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
part of the traffic

1375
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
on a new one

1376
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and it turns out

1377
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
if you want to do it on IEC

1378
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and you have virtual machines

1379
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
it's not that easy

1380
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
it's very complex

1381
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
ok

1382
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and

1383
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
let's talk about

1384
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
service software

1385
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
the third layer

1386
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
of abstraction

1387
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
what is it?

1388
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I think that

1389
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
it's very

1390
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
popular

1391
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
more and more

1392
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I don't know if the basics

1393
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
fall under that

1394
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
you just say

1395
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I would click there

1396
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and I would have

1397
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
a user

1398
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
and now

1399
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I can put a base there

1400
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and I get back

1401
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
that port

1402
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
sorry, that IP

1403
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
that's a username

1404
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and there's a base

1405
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and that's one thing

1406
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
if you want to have

1407
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
a mail server to send

1408
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
instead of

1409
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
saying

1410
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I need a mail server

1411
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
open

1412
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:15,000
The GIMP, SPF, all those things, certificates, so I don't go to spam, no, you just, there's an API, you call the API, and that's it.

1413
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:24,000
You want to call a person on the phone, or you want to send an SMS, then you have an API there that you pay for every SMS,

1414
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:31,000
then you receive it as a certificate, and then you send it to, I don't know, Postrequest, REST, or whatever else.

1415
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And then there's a huge, huge amount of that.

1416
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:49,000
For old school, old school engineers who, for example, were, who went through, we just mentioned those shortcuts,

1417
00:50:49,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and if we go back to setting up your own servers in your own rack and stuff, if you go from that infrastructure, platforms, SaaS,

1418
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:09,000
to ultimately LAMBDA, and so on, there's a lot of arguments here, that every level, when you go to vendor locking,

1419
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
you always have less control over how you see it.

1420
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Because every level of abstraction is a question of whether you can achieve a lot inside, and you tune it, and, well, let's just say that.

1421
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Now that's the answer.

1422
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
One time, a colleague told me that when you drive on public roads, or local roads, right,

1423
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean, for him, when he's driving, it looks like a bus that's pulling you from the center, or from the center.

1424
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
You, in fact, have a project, and at that point you decide what you're going to choose, and then you go with it.

1425
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And that doesn't mean that you're entirely responsible for that vendor.

1426
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You're not an Apple user, or a Linux user, or a Windows user.

1427
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's a little harder for me to replace that.

1428
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And then, if you look at it from a business perspective, you can also ask yourself, is this really such a problem?

1429
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And it's really funny to me that in our space, we think a lot about it,

1430
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
because we work with very, very large companies that are not directly technological competitors to AWS.

1431
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
All people work in risk analysis, right?

1432
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
With the team that's responsible for that.

1433
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And legal, and everything.

1434
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
They're just like that.

1435
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And, I don't know, we now have AWS.

1436
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The probability that AWS will disappear is very small.

1437
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And how we're going to fix it, how we're going to fix the engineers, that's their problem.

1438
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's going to come from me.

1439
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And the benefits that we're going to get from them, because it's not like a business.

1440
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Is there a point where you say, shit, the components are becoming too expensive.

1441
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
We're going to go back.

1442
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We're going to go a level lower.

1443
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
How is this happening?

1444
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
This used to happen in our space.

1445
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And a lot of times, people don't know how to calculate expenses.

1446
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Either equipment or people.

1447
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And then I think a lot of times...

1448
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
For example, let's say we have two companies.

1449
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And it's very successful.

1450
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And each year they get 100,000 euros.

1451
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And then they get 4,000 euros.

1452
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And you say, wow, that's really a lot.

1453
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
We're going to go back to...

1454
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I don't know.

1455
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
We're going to hire engineers.

1456
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And then we're going to get a junior DevOps to fix it.

1457
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Because that's going to cost us a lot.

1458
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Because 4,000 euros is really a lot.

1459
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
This might work for our bubble.

1460
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because we're in some technology.

1461
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And you say, okay, I'm going to hire a junior.

1462
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I have to pay him 2,000 euros.

1463
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And then the amortization.

1464
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Let's say it pays off somehow.

1465
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But in the end, I think...

1466
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
This is mainly happening because people don't know how to calculate expenses.

1467
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I pay a lot of attention to that.

1468
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You buy a new tractor, it costs 5 million.

1469
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Even if you don't deserve 5 million back.

1470
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
This is also happening to us in IT.

1471
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I think we're not very good at it.

1472
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Or at calculating.

1473
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
To be able to calculate it a little.

1474
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Now, if something is really obscure...

1475
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
In the end, it's a cost-benefit.

1476
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
If something is really obscure.

1477
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You say, aha, that's so expensive.

1478
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
We're going to migrate to another one.

1479
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The price is different.

1480
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The price of migration is different.

1481
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Can we do it from the inside?

1482
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
The risks we're going to have if we stay here are like this.

1483
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The risks of migration are like this.

1484
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
The risk that a new vendor that is now more expensive will increase the price is like this.

1485
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I also pay attention to that.

1486
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
People choose, let's say...

1487
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Slovenians make cloud offers based on price.

1488
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's a very bad strategy.

1489
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
At the time, Google was only one-fourth of the price of AWS.

1490
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That was their selling point.

1491
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
When I started using Google Cloud, which is a good compute engine...

1492
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
They were like, we're only 25% of the price of AWS.

1493
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Great, but...

1494
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Maybe in two months you won't be 25% of the price of AWS.

1495
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And Google is now the same price as AWS.

1496
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And they have more things to do.

1497
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Which is good in the end, if you have a smaller team.

1498
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
But it's not the cheapest.

1499
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Maybe somewhere more expensive.

1500
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
You have to think about it.

1501
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Never say never.

1502
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Maybe it will pay off.

1503
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But...

1504
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Do you really need your StriveX to wash a car once a year?

1505
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Or to go to the laundry to have someone else wash it for you?

1506
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
If it makes you very happy to have your own StriveX...

1507
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And you pay people for it...

1508
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's also fine.

1509
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Everything comes naturally.

1510
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Before I tell you...

1511
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Let's try to segment these providers.

1512
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Can we do it on a high level?

1513
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Or on a business level?

1514
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Or from the top?

1515
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Can we, for example...

1516
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform.

1517
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Do you notice any differences?

1518
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
How are these platforms designed?

1519
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
How do they start to be used?

1520
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Is it possible to use it on a high level?

1521
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
There are also big three.

1522
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I have a lot of experience with AWS and Google Cloud.

1523
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
With Azure, less.

1524
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But...

1525
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I've seen companies I've worked for use it.

1526
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
But I haven't worked with them directly.

1527
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Because they are big systems.

1528
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And I would say...

1529
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
AWS...

1530
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Is...

1531
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
More like...

1532
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
StarCloud.

1533
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's more like Dino.

1534
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And then you can see the legacy, how it's being used.

1535
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Things are well done.

1536
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Properly done.

1537
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
But...

1538
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
If you want to adapt...

1539
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Like Jason.

1540
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
When you don't understand why it's there.

1541
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You need to gather your thoughts.

1542
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That's why it's not important...

1543
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Do you have access to something?

1544
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
You can find a lot of things.

1545
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Can this service do this?

1546
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Can this user do this?

1547
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Can this virtual one do this?

1548
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Can this Lambda function do this?

1549
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
What's the reason?

1550
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's like an old XML.

1551
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It's edited.

1552
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And grounded.

1553
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Why is it there?

1554
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It's...

1555
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
On the market...

1556
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
There's a huge market share.

1557
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Google doesn't catch it.

1558
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Azure doesn't catch it.

1559
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
If you learn one cloud...

1560
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And you want to be a professional...

1561
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
On big companies...

1562
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
AWS is the way to go.

1563
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And for a reason.

1564
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It's a complex machine.

1565
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And it's...

1566
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's your career.

1567
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
AWS is your career.

1568
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Google is...

1569
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
In my opinion...

1570
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's too shallow.

1571
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Hipsterish has certain advantages.

1572
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
For example...

1573
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
If you have more projects...

1574
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And more stages and production...

1575
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And two projects...

1576
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
You can segment it in Google.

1577
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
That's one thing.

1578
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I think...

1579
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Access is more loose.

1580
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Network is more loose.

1581
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's not that strict.

1582
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
If you want to talk outside your WPC...

1583
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You talk outside your WPC.

1584
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
That's a problem.

1585
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
It's reasonable.

1586
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You can create security.

1587
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Not that it's not security.

1588
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
But it's not an extreme level.

1589
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
There are certain things...

1590
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I think Google is still...

1591
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Ahead of everything else.

1592
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Data analysis.

1593
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
They bought Looker.

1594
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's a platform where you can look at data.

1595
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Their BigQuery is very powerful.

1596
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
There are segments in the industry...

1597
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Where...

1598
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Google is ahead.

1599
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Almost everywhere else...

1600
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's the same as AWS.

1601
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Or it lags behind.

1602
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I played with their Cloud Functions.

1603
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I think you played with their Cloud Functions too.

1604
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
The same documentation.

1605
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It all makes sense.

1606
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But when you want to combine things...

1607
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Strange things happen.

1608
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
If you want to have IPv6 in Google Cloud...

1609
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
That's not possible.

1610
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Reload balancer is over.

1611
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If it's good, it doesn't matter.

1612
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
If it's bad, it doesn't matter.

1613
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
You can try it.

1614
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
If it matters, try it.

1615
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's not the best choice.

1616
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Azure...

1617
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's really nice.

1618
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Because...

1619
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
How do you...

1620
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Unlock and...

1621
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Make happy...

1622
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
All the people on Microsoft stack.

1623
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It's very simple.

1624
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You start hacking...

1625
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Security releases...

1626
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
On-premise security.

1627
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And you start pushing Azure.

1628
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And you say...

1629
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Active Directory...

1630
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
You managed it yourself.

1631
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It's so hard.

1632
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
We offer it to you as a student.

1633
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And it's all very easy.

1634
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And a bunch of candy.

1635
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Because it's such a hard thing.

1636
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's a cost.

1637
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You already have Microsoft Teams.

1638
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Exactly.

1639
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And Cloud...

1640
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I think it's great.

1641
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Because I think...

1642
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
If...

1643
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
If you already have it.

1644
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And you need to do something.

1645
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It doesn't matter if you...

1646
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Go to AWS.

1647
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You're committed to it.

1648
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I like it.

1649
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
That's my...

1650
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Hypothesis.

1651
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I have a feeling that...

1652
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
With Google...

1653
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
The development of Cloud goes...

1654
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
From the point of view that...

1655
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
First of all...

1656
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
They develop things for their needs.

1657
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Primarily.

1658
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And then those things they already use...

1659
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Then they go to some transformations.

1660
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And through those transformations...

1661
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
They get to their...

1662
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Public Cloud or something.

1663
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Just like with Microsoft and Azure...

1664
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I have a feeling that...

1665
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Their main customers are...

1666
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Enterprises from the beginning.

1667
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And I have a feeling that...

1668
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
With Azure...

1669
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
They are much more...

1670
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And better connected.

1671
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I don't know what else to say.

1672
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I don't know.

1673
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You already suggested using Synapse.

1674
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I think they are much more...

1675
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Coherently connected.

1676
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
With Google.

1677
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And...

1678
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
One is coming from themselves.

1679
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

1680
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
My feeling was like that.

1681
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
When I saw those tools.

1682
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Is that a hypothesis?

1683
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I know for a fact that...

1684
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Google definitely doesn't work like that.

1685
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Google doesn't use Cloud.

1686
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
If you try engineering.

1687
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
They force people to use their Cloud.

1688
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How do they use it?

1689
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I don't know.

1690
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
They still use Borg.

1691
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
They are not consumers.

1692
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Their concepts are different.

1693
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Maybe they use Bitcoin for their products.

1694
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Maybe.

1695
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
But that's not the case.

1696
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
They would probably eat...

1697
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
What do you call it?

1698
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Eat your own dog food.

1699
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
They would probably eat a briquette.

1700
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
But...

1701
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
You can see that...

1702
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Google Cloud has a lot of problems.

1703
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I think that their product...

1704
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Segment...

1705
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Project.

1706
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That's why...

1707
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
First of all, they look around.

1708
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And then they try to implement it.

1709
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So they have a lot of cash.

1710
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But there are still things there.

1711
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
You don't pay attention to that.

1712
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You really pay attention to that.

1713
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
If you...

1714
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
If you pay attention to that.

1715
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That's what I pay attention to.

1716
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
If you use cutting edge.

1717
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Yes.

1718
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Ok.

1719
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Let's say...

1720
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I played with...

1721
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I played with...

1722
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
When I say I played, I mean I used it.

1723
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I didn't use it for my website.

1724
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I played with IBM's Cloud.

1725
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I also played with Oracle's Cloud.

1726
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Also those two...

1727
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Also those two...

1728
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Also those two...

1729
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I would say...

1730
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
If we go through all the shortcuts...

1731
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
That we had before.

1732
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
When you say, I just want to have a computer.

1733
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
That's it.

1734
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I just want to have 5 virtual machines.

1735
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And a disk, and I don't know what else.

1736
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
There are no crazy differences.

1737
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
You get the same boxes.

1738
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
If you don't need them, you spend them.

1739
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
There are no differences.

1740
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I think there are more differences.

1741
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Now I need Oracle's Autonomous Database.

1742
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I want it to manage itself.

1743
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Clean up, scale it up.

1744
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
There are a lot of differences.

1745
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
And when you go to even higher abstract levels.

1746
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
When you go to Lambda.

1747
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
When you go to those specifics.

1748
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
There are a lot of differences.

1749
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And there are also...

1750
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I see differences.

1751
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Maybe you said it yourself.

1752
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Maybe you said it yourself.

1753
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Sometimes I see those boxes.

1754
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Or services that fill them.

1755
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
They work great on their own.

1756
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Sometimes I see problems.

1757
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
When you have to connect those boxes.

1758
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
When you have to connect those boxes.

1759
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
For example, with Google.

1760
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I noticed Google Cloud Run.

1761
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It's the Knative runner for containers.

1762
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's fully managed.

1763
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It works with other services.

1764
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
With VPC, with Caching,

1765
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
with Redis and everything.

1766
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
You connect that part.

1767
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It's one thing how you do it.

1768
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's another thing what documentation.

1769
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
But to be fair, it's relatively new.

1770
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's still developing.

1771
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It'll be different tomorrow.

1772
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
As it was a couple of months ago.

1773
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But I see those differences.

1774
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
How things are combined.

1775
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And where you have right now

1776
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Hybrid or non-hybrid cloud.

1777
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Or you have some outdated

1778
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
applications.

1779
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You have Knative.

1780
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
If you're Slovenian

1781
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
or someone who works in Slovenia.

1782
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Maybe it's more important

1783
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
that if you already use

1784
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Google Workspaces.

1785
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You already have all the users inside.

1786
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Why not use Google Cloud?

1787
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And I think it's legit.

1788
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Reason for

1789
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
using Google Cloud.

1790
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Don't go into

1791
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
over-optimization.

1792
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It's not worth it.

1793
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I think people will think

1794
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
oh my god, we've been there

1795
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
and they'll get stuck.

1796
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
We could go on

1797
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
another topic.

1798
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Now,

1799
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
let's talk about

1800
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
the next big topic.

1801
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
If we said

1802
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
one server, then we had more servers.

1803
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Then you moved the phone

1804
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and said give me a new disk.

1805
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Let me configure it.

1806
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Then you sent mails.

1807
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Now,

1808
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
where is

1809
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
in all this

1810
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
heat of some

1811
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
technologies and tools.

1812
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Where is the space

1813
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
for automation?

1814
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
As engineers,

1815
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
we need automation inside this space.

1816
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Maybe

1817
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
that's the answer.

1818
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
There are many

1819
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
use cases.

1820
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
One of the use cases

1821
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
is that

1822
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
all the dashboards are

1823
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
relatively complex.

1824
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
With time,

1825
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
when you click the resources in the cloud,

1826
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
it's problematic

1827
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
because

1828
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
you don't know

1829
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
what exactly you clicked.

1830
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It would be more difficult

1831
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
to have a sheet of paper

1832
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
saying we need this

1833
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and we can have it in the cloud.

1834
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
If you have

1835
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
up to 20 dashboards

1836
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and you don't use many things,

1837
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
you have more people

1838
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
who know what resources

1839
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
you clicked.

1840
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Otherwise,

1841
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
it's complex.

1842
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Then there are things

1843
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
where you need more dynamics.

1844
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
A good example is

1845
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
when you do surveys

1846
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
for presidential elections

1847
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and you have

1848
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
an image.

1849
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
When you send people

1850
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
an email

1851
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
to do the survey,

1852
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
in the first minutes,

1853
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
a lot of people will click it.

1854
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Traditionally,

1855
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
even if you click auto-scaling,

1856
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
it will be too cold

1857
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and people

1858
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
won't do it until

1859
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
auto-scaling says

1860
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
we have a lot of requests,

1861
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
but you lost

1862
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
track of the users

1863
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
who opened the email.

1864
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It's a bit theoretical

1865
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
but maybe

1866
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
it's worth it

1867
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
to warm up the system

1868
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
so you hire 4 times more

1869
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
surveyors and then send the email.

1870
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
How would you do that?

1871
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
You can do it with automation.

1872
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's a useful thing.

1873
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
You get

1874
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
faster

1875
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and you can

1876
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
react to needs.

1877
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You have better tooling

1878
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
for automated

1879
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
enlargement and

1880
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
elasticity of your

1881
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
infrastructure.

1882
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Cloud providers

1883
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
often have auto-scaling stories

1884
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
which will be watched

1885
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
by users

1886
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
using a reminder

1887
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
or

1888
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
a processor.

1889
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
You can

1890
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
enlarge it and

1891
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
shorten it.

1892
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You also need webasto

1893
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
when your car goes

1894
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
in front of you.

1895
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
You can work with that.

1896
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
A good example is

1897
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
we have 2 microservices

1898
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
and traditionally

1899
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
one click of the other

1900
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
via HTTP

1901
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
but if the other falls down,

1902
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
the first one falls down too.

1903
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
We are 4 but

1904
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
if one falls down,

1905
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
we all fall down.

1906
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And then we say

1907
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
that we will create a queue

1908
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
or a PubSub system

1909
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
where we will log

1910
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
the messages.

1911
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
If one falls down,

1912
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
it's great.

1913
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The problem is

1914
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
when you have

1915
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
a lot of microservices

1916
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and a lot of queues

1917
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
and you have all those queues

1918
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
in the cloud

1919
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and you can

1920
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
say in your code

1921
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
that this service is lagging on that queue

1922
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
and then you have another process

1923
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
or a program which looks at all those services

1924
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and where the queues

1925
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
need to exist

1926
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
and as a guarantee

1927
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
confirms that they exist

1928
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
on the cloud.

1929
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Ok, so let's

1930
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
sort out 2 things.

1931
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
The concept

1932
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
goes to

1933
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
the declarative

1934
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
description

1935
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
of what you have

1936
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
or what you want to have

1937
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and instead of writing it

1938
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
in a list, we write it

1939
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
in some YAML

1940
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
in some format, file, JSON, YAML

1941
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
whatever

1942
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
or

1943
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
we use a programming language

1944
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
to do it, but we describe

1945
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
what we want to have

1946
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
and then some tooling

1947
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
will determine what is already done

1948
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
and what is not done

1949
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and will determine

1950
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
which changes need to be made

1951
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and will communicate with the cloud

1952
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
or with some tooling

1953
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
how to do it

1954
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and how to do it will be determined.

1955
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And in this I would say

1956
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
infrastructure as code

1957
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
or infrastructure

1958
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
as a code

1959
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
two A's.

1960
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
There is also something

1961
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
called configuration management

1962
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
and these things

1963
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
overlap a bit.

1964
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's more about

1965
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I already have a server

1966
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
and I have 5 pages

1967
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
and there

1968
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
in Nginx or Apache

1969
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I have virtual domains

1970
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
or servers

1971
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
where I say if a person

1972
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
comes with a domain nom.c

1973
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I show him this page

1974
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
and if he comes

1975
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
with another domain

1976
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
then

1977
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
he goes somewhere else.

1978
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And now when I add

1979
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
if I have 5 pages, then I add 6 pages

1980
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
then I have to change this configuration

1981
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
and so that I don't do it manually

1982
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
you have more configuration

1983
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
management systems.

1984
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
These are systems that are more

1985
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
specialized so that

1986
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
for example

1987
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Ansible will function

1988
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
so that you add

1989
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
a new domain

1990
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
it connects

1991
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
via SSH to

1992
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
the server, changes the file

1993
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
so that Nginx

1994
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
reloads or restarts

1995
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
the details

1996
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
and

1997
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
that's it.

1998
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Ansible also has

1999
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
a different module

2000
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
that will tell you

2001
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
if I still want

2002
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
to install this

2003
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
virtual domain and

2004
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
it will also take care of that.

2005
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's not necessarily more specialized

2006
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
for configuration management

2007
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
but infrastructure is code

2008
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
that takes care of infrastructure

2009
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and that's also part of Ansible.

2010
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Before we get into the specific tooling

2011
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
everyone who

2012
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
might be listening to this

2013
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and I don't know

2014
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
if SSH on the server is

2015
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
done manually or if

2016
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
scripts are written to do it

2017
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
why would

2018
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
you pay for this tooling

2019
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
that we will talk about

2020
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
to use this tooling versus

2021
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
to just copy via FTP

2022
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
or SSH and then do it manually

2023
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
what's the advantage?

2024
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
At some point it's hard to scale

2025
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
that's the first thing

2026
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
at another point

2027
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
you can do it manually

2028
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and then decide

2029
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
if you want to do it with or without script

2030
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
and yeah

2031
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
bash is also

2032
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
a fun language

2033
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
if you can call it that

2034
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
that's also

2035
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
from the time

2036
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
when it was first

2037
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
introduced

2038
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
and

2039
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I think

2040
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
it was

2041
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Error prone scripts are hard to maintain, and then you have to implement one more thing a lot of times with independence.

2042
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,000
That means that when you call something, it already exists, it's okay, if it doesn't exist, you do it.

2043
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
You can't go back to the fact that you want to do something and it still exists.

2044
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
That means that you can call it many times and it will always be okay.

2045
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And that's why these tools are important.

2046
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
One more interesting thing.

2047
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Do you want to be the same person who wrote the script that other people have to maintain?

2048
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It's no longer in the company.

2049
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That's a big question for me.

2050
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
What is the correct way of writing this language?

2051
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:54,000
How to maintain it is very tricky, because I think such a detail is difficult.

2052
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
We don't all know this language so well.

2053
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
It's a bit like JavaScript, but it's not so popular that everyone knows it so well.

2054
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Okay.

2055
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
We have now described this basic concept.

2056
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Previsioning, configuration.

2057
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Previsioning means that you move servers, set up networking, load balancer.

2058
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Configuration means that you set up packages, make sure that the configuration is specific for the service, etc.

2059
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And then comes the deployment of a workload or data workload.

2060
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Which also needs to be configured or packed.

2061
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
And then things start to flow.

2062
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Basically, we have two stages.

2063
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The first stage is the initial setup of the infrastructure, then the management of the infrastructure.

2064
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
The second stage is the initialization of the app, and then the management of the app.

2065
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
These are the two layers that we see in the whole space.

2066
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Now we will talk a little more about the other players that help inside.

2067
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
We will talk a little about the boss, the puppet, and you will talk about Terraform.

2068
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Okay?

2069
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Okay.

2070
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Mixed salad.

2071
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Mixed salad.

2072
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
If...

2073
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Let's sort them out a little bit.

2074
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
What do these four things mean to you?

2075
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
What does this tool mean to you, for example?

2076
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
What does the boss mean to you, and what does the puppet mean to you?

2077
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I will ignore the fact that there are three of us, because it's easier.

2078
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I think that in recent years, things have converged a lot.

2079
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Puppet is not so popular, but...

2080
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Puppet and Ansible with the build-up were more...

2081
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
What is it called?

2082
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
With the configuration management tool.

2083
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
For Puppet, I don't know if it can run on infrastructure.

2084
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
When I used it last time, it didn't work.

2085
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
The difference between the two was that...

2086
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Ansible will connect with SSH on servers.

2087
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Or at the end of the day, if it supports SSH.

2088
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I used it for Raspberry Pi.

2089
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And it will make some changes.

2090
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,000
The good thing is that you don't need a client up there.

2091
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It doesn't have to be a SSH client, but most of the time it is.

2092
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And that's the model we call push.

2093
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Ansible pushes some things.

2094
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Puppet, for example, in Solstack, works the opposite.

2095
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
You have a client called Puppet Master.

2096
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And then you have more things that connect up there.

2097
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And they say, what condition do I have to be in?

2098
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I'm this, she's that, what's my condition?

2099
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And then they pull it down.

2100
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And they change their configuration as they need to.

2101
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Why is that useful?

2102
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
For example, we have KAL machines, which are smart.

2103
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Which are scattered all over Slovenia.

2104
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And they are behind some NAT.

2105
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And it's hard to penetrate them through networking.

2106
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
They will simply contact you.

2107
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Or, for example, if you have a conference.

2108
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And you have 5 Raspberry Pi's that can show you sponsor slides.

2109
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's easier for you.

2110
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
You disassemble them until you write a note.

2111
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
They are already there.

2112
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
You can reboot one or the other.

2113
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
They are registered back there.

2114
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I'm interested in the conference.

2115
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
You mentioned autonomous vehicles.

2116
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Yes, I've already organized an autonomous vehicle conference.

2117
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
But I don't have it yet.

2118
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It's a very practical thing.

2119
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
We can use it on B-sites.

2120
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
And then you lose a little bit of the existing infrastructure.

2121
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Because it doesn't make sense for the client to get some later infrastructure.

2122
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It was different before.

2123
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You have steps that start like this.

2124
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
You create a virtual account on AWS or Node.

2125
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You wait for it to be done.

2126
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Then you connect it to SSH.

2127
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You put it on a Docker container.

2128
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And you start it.

2129
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It's a hybrid model.

2130
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
In the first phase, you have the infrastructure.

2131
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,000
In the second phase, you configure it.

2132
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Terraform?

2133
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,000
You can do these things in Robo.

2134
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
But it's not done to fully modify it.

2135
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Terraform is done.

2136
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
In Terraform, you write a language.

2137
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It's very simple.

2138
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Very simple.

2139
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You have different providers.

2140
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
A provider gives you an interface for a cloud.

2141
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
For example, if you use AWS, you'll have AWS providers.

2142
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Then you put architecture on it.

2143
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:26,000
If you want to have WPC,

2144
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
networking,

2145
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
you can have Kubernetes,

2146
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
users, service accounts,

2147
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
custom roles,

2148
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
bindings of custom roles on users.

2149
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
You write it there.

2150
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And when you run it,

2151
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
the infrastructure is built there.

2152
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Terraform has a local representation

2153
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
of what's on the cloud.

2154
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It's very declarative.

2155
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
When you remove an object from the code,

2156
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
it will look at its local state

2157
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
and erase the resource.

2158
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
That's how it works.

2159
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
In Terraform,

2160
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
what happens if someone from the team

2161
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
clicks on something on the cloud

2162
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
and it wasn't over Terraform?

2163
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
That's a great question.

2164
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Nothing.

2165
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Terraform works like this.

2166
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Whenever someone does something,

2167
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
they write it down locally

2168
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
or in a shared state.

2169
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
They write down the value.

2170
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
They say, I'll manage it.

2171
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It's like a file.

2172
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It's a file with values.

2173
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It writes down, I'll manage it.

2174
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You add an object to the Terraform file

2175
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
and it will generate it.

2176
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
When you erase it,

2177
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
and you don't need an object in Terraform,

2178
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
how does it know it needs to erase something?

2179
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It creates a delta between states

2180
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
and says, in my code,

2181
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
it's gone.

2182
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Someone erased it.

2183
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It sees that the reference

2184
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
to that object is no longer there.

2185
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I have it in the state,

2186
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
but it's on the cloud.

2187
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
My actions are to erase that object.

2188
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
If I, as a regular cloud user,

2189
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
create a virtual machine,

2190
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Terraform will erase it.

2191
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
It's not in the state.

2192
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
It's not in the code either.

2193
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
That's it.

2194
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Why is it done this way?

2195
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Whenever you click on the cloud,

2196
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
a cascade of resources

2197
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
can be automatically created.

2198
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You can't call the cloud

2199
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and say, give me all the resources

2200
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
that exist inside.

2201
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
That doesn't exist.

2202
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It would be totally unbearable.

2203
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
That's what I wanted to ask you.

2204
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
What does Terraform plan do?

2205
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Terraform plan does the following.

2206
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
It takes a local code,

2207
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
compares it to the state,

2208
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
and calculates the diff.

2209
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Do I need to create objects?

2210
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Is nothing going to change?

2211
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Or do I need to erase things?

2212
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Implicitly, what does it do?

2213
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
It also calls the cloud

2214
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
and updates those objects

2215
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
that are in the state.

2216
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
That is,

2217
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
if I add a label,

2218
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
it will say,

2219
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
let's do it again,

2220
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
takes the code,

2221
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
looks at the objects

2222
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
that are in the state,

2223
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
goes to all the objects

2224
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
that are in the state on the cloud,

2225
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
pulls the last state,

2226
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
and then just compares

2227
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
if the local state

2228
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
and the code are the same.

2229
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
If you add an object to the code,

2230
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
it will add an object.

2231
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
If you remove an object from the code,

2232
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
it will say,

2233
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I will erase one object.

2234
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
If you accidentally add a label

2235
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
to the cloud provider for some reason,

2236
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
you didn't change anything.

2237
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
It will also say,

2238
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
this is different,

2239
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
one label is different.

2240
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Why am I explaining this?

2241
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It has a lot of implications

2242
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
from the point of view

2243
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
if someone hacks you

2244
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
because of security.

2245
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
If you have something in IAC,

2246
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
you can chronologically run the plan

2247
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
and see if there was a change.

2248
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
If you have a state in the cloud,

2249
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
a state that is written for you,

2250
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
if a delta occurs

2251
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
on the objects that are in provision,

2252
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
it's cool that there is a change.

2253
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
The security team

2254
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
will probably say,

2255
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
no, that's...

2256
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Kubernetes has auto-upgraded,

2257
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
that's why this version diff

2258
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
or U, what the hell is this payload?

2259
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It will make a lot of code

2260
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
and then I will have a lot of questions.

2261
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I hope that people

2262
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
are still listening.

2263
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
In December, a lot of people

2264
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
will be listening.

2265
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Next question, tricky.

2266
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Hey, Andraž,

2267
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
we already have everything

2268
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
installed on AWS or Azure.

2269
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
We have everything installed on Azure.

2270
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It works great.

2271
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
This is our production environment.

2272
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Now we would have

2273
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
another environment,

2274
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
a staging environment.

2275
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
What can I do with Terraform?

2276
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
What do I have to do first?

2277
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
That's a great question.

2278
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
It's very practical.

2279
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
A lot of these tools,

2280
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
including Terraform,

2281
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
support what is called

2282
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
importing.

2283
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
You import things

2284
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
and it doesn't work automatically

2285
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
as someone might imagine,

2286
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
but basically

2287
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
it does the following.

2288
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
You say,

2289
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I would like to import

2290
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
a unique identifier

2291
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
for a virtual machine,

2292
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
and from the source object

2293
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
it will import it.

2294
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's a specific ID object

2295
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
in the cloud.

2296
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
What Terraform does is

2297
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
it looks at the cloud

2298
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
and imports it into its state.

2299
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Then it says,

2300
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
and when the next

2301
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
plan arrives,

2302
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
it will say,

2303
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I deleted this virtual machine

2304
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
and I have it in my state.

2305
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
What you do is

2306
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
you put this part into the code

2307
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
and that's how the import happens.

2308
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
When you run it again,

2309
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
everything is fine,

2310
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
it's in the code,

2311
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
it's in the state,

2312
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
but how do you force it

2313
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
to call the cloud app

2314
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
and import it into its state?

2315
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
So there is an import

2316
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
for Terraform.

2317
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
If you have a production environment

2318
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
in Azure,

2319
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
you take Azure Terraform Provider,

2320
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
you support Terraform import,

2321
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
you will get a state,

2322
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
you will see an email,

2323
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and then you can

2324
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
move forward with Terraform.

2325
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So this use case is

2326
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
completely normal.

2327
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
This is a real use case,

2328
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
because

2329
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
typically,

2330
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
from an engineering manager perspective,

2331
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
you have people to train,

2332
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
and then you say,

2333
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
from now on,

2334
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
all the things we do

2335
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
will be described in the IAC tool,

2336
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
for example, in Terraform.

2337
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
You run this for a while,

2338
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
and then you say,

2339
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
we would now formalize

2340
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
the things that are in Terraform.

2341
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
What does this give you?

2342
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
It gives you a chance

2343
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
to spin up complex new environments.

2344
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Let's say you have production

2345
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
and staging,

2346
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
and you see you have so many people

2347
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
on the team,

2348
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
that you need one more environment,

2349
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
because so many people depend on staging,

2350
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
and on the other hand,

2351
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
so many people break it,

2352
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
because they do things,

2353
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
and then you say,

2354
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
maybe we need to rethink

2355
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
if we want to have a two-tier

2356
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
environment setup,

2357
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
we need something else.

2358
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
These are some of the things.

2359
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
You know what?

2360
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
In the teams

2361
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
that use IAC,

2362
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
or maybe in the Terraform world,

2363
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
because this question

2364
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
is not so relevant,

2365
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
could it be the responsibility

2366
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
of the engineers

2367
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
to write Terraform definitions?

2368
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Could it be

2369
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
the responsibility of DevOps?

2370
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Can you give a tip?

2371
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Who do you think

2372
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
would benefit from Terraform?

2373
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Who writes Terraform?

2374
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Do you think

2375
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
as many engineers

2376
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
as possible could use Terraform,

2377
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
and DevOps could supervise it?

2378
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
How could the organization

2379
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
include Terraform in the stack?

2380
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
This is not just

2381
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
a personal answer,

2382
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
it depends on how you have

2383
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
the teams in the organization.

2384
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
You can't just

2385
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
let the engineer do it.

2386
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I know it's not DevOps,

2387
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
it's the infrastructure.

2388
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
People are different

2389
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
than developers.

2390
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
If you have a small team,

2391
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
give it a look.

2392
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
If it helps you,

2393
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
give it a try.

2394
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I'll start like this.

2395
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
If you're a junior in DevOps,

2396
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
and you don't have a team,

2397
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
give it a try.

2398
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
You write Terraform

2399
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
and you say Terraform deploy,

2400
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
or something like that.

2401
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Then you go to Cosillo,

2402
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
when your wallet hurts so much

2403
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
that you don't have cash,

2404
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
you just say destroy,

2405
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and you go to Cosillo.

2406
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
When it's destroyed,

2407
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
in 20 seconds,

2408
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
you say deploy,

2409
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
and it will be back in 1 minute

2410
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
and 50 seconds.

2411
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
You won't click on all of these things

2412
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
because the system will

2413
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
just deploy.

2414
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
And then you have a bill.

2415
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I get a bill

2416
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
that is on

2417
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
63 pages.

2418
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
The total value of the bill

2419
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
is 3 euros,

2420
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
and every order is 1 cent.

2421
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Most of these offers

2422
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
have pay-as-you-go.

2423
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It's a minimal time frame,

2424
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
but

2425
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
most of them have bizarre

2426
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
accounts.

2427
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It makes it possible for me

2428
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
to have minecraft

2429
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
in the server,

2430
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
and I call Terraform

2431
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
and I use an S3 bucket

2432
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
with a state node, and then I destroy it.

2433
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And it takes

2434
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
a bit of planning to go to the fridge,

2435
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
but

2436
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
there can definitely be failures.

2437
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I don't know, but that's how it works.

2438
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And you don't have to pay for it.

2439
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
How do we get out of this?

2440
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
You know what?

2441
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I hope that people

2442
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
are still interested

2443
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
and that they still know.

2444
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Thank you for that.

2445
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I wanted to ask you

2446
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
if Terraform is better

2447
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
for development alone,

2448
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
or is it a practice

2449
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
that it's a part of the CI pipeline?

2450
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Maybe you could also

2451
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
tell us

2452
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
where Terraform

2453
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
comes from.

2454
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
That's a great question.

2455
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
When you're alone,

2456
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
will you be able

2457
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
to run Terraform

2458
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
from your PC,

2459
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
and will the situation be local?

2460
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
In that situation,

2461
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
there's also locking happening.

2462
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
If I want something,

2463
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
there's a global lock,

2464
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
which means that no one

2465
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
else can do it.

2466
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It costs two people,

2467
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
you can put the state file

2468
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
on something that's S3 compatible,

2469
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and then everything will happen.

2470
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
You can't synchronize

2471
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
the two parts,

2472
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
and you can do it locally.

2473
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Locally, you can create

2474
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
all the objects,

2475
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
which means that

2476
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
everything will work well.

2477
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
But in the end,

2478
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
it's pretty fluid.

2479
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Specifically for Terraform,

2480
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
you have Terraform Cloud,

2481
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
and you have

2482
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.

2483
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Which

2484
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
stores

2485
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
the state,

2486
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
and locks it,

2487
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and executes everything.

2488
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Which means that

2489
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I send the definition

2490
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
to Terraform Cloud,

2491
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
and it will do it by itself.

2492
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
It's even sexier.

2493
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
You have a repo,

2494
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
and you make a pull request

2495
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
with some Terraform changes

2496
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
and Terraform Cloud will come

2497
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
or 1.0.0.0.

2498
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And the bot will tell you

2499
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Hey Delta,

2500
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I'll make a virtual

2501
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
server,

2502
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
write apply

2503
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
to apply,

2504
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
and if you're satisfied

2505
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
with that Delta,

2506
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
that Delta is also local,

2507
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
it won't change,

2508
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
there are some nuances.

2509
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
The first apply will happen,

2510
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
and then it will say,

2511
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
this is now applied,

2512
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
and then you close it.

2513
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
The rest of the team

2514
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
can help you,

2515
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
because you can make it so

2516
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
everyone can make changes,

2517
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
make pull requests,

2518
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
but only certain people

2519
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
can say, hey Delta,

2520
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I'm going to apply,

2521
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and then you close it.

2522
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
It also means that all the tokens

2523
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
are in front of the vendor,

2524
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
and the vendors

2525
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
are also like,

2526
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
so compliant, blah, blah, blah,

2527
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and then you have it all done.

2528
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
The good thing is that

2529
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
1.0.0.0.

2530
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
1.0.0.1.

2531
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I keep forgetting.

2532
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Out.0 and 1.0.

2533
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
It also has a free tier,

2534
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
so if you want to play,

2535
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
it's for

2536
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
all of our

2537
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
vendors, so

2538
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
you register there,

2539
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
and you can download

2540
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
and play with it.

2541
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Now I'm going to

2542
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
take you out for dinner,

2543
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
and then we're going to sleep.

2544
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
We're going to go

2545
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
a little bit further,

2546
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
and I'd like you to explain

2547
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
where inside

2548
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
there are the columns.

2549
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Yes.

2550
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Can you explain that?

2551
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
We've been talking a lot about Terraform.

2552
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Yes.

2553
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
We were in 1.0, and now we're in 6.0.

2554
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Explain it to me.

2555
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
The tools that are focused on infrastructure

2556
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
as code, you have

2557
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
the ones that are purely static, like CloudFormation,

2558
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
where you just write some YAML,

2559
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
and it's applied, you have some templates there,

2560
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
you have some dynamics,

2561
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
then you have Terraform,

2562
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
you use the language that is HashiConfigurationLanguage,

2563
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
it's a very simple language.

2564
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
That's how it is.

2565
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Is it more secure than YAML?

2566
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Yes, it is.

2567
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Is it more secure than YAML?

2568
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I also think it's more secure,

2569
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
you don't need a safe depository.

2570
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I didn't choose that,

2571
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
so I hope not.

2572
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
That's always my statement.

2573
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
But that's what it's all about.

2574
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
You have simple objects,

2575
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
and you can make simple loops,

2576
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
and the string manipulates it,

2577
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
because it's important.

2578
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It's very simple to learn.

2579
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
You say,

2580
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I need all the power in the world,

2581
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
that's why I'm so smart,

2582
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
and I want to make declarative descriptions

2583
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
of the infrastructure

2584
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
with general purpose language,

2585
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
like JavaScript, Go, whatever.

2586
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Now,

2587
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I would also like to have

2588
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
another provider, Terraform,

2589
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
if you want,

2590
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
and you say, I only trust you

2591
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
that I will make a for loop

2592
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
that will make 12 virtuals,

2593
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
God forbid you get confused

2594
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
when one is missing,

2595
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
or there are too many of them,

2596
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
and you can also do that.

2597
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So that means

2598
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
that in the for loop

2599
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I write the word Zanko,

2600
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
and I say, make 12 virtuals,

2601
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
and in the for loop

2602
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I will then do what with the code.

2603
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Will it make some definitions

2604
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
in the back,

2605
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
from the same source,

2606
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
or will it call for each type?

2607
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
That's how it works,

2608
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
you have a program file,

2609
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
and the for loop

2610
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
generates an object

2611
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
that is a context,

2612
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
and that object travels

2613
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
through your code,

2614
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
and then it is inserted

2615
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
into the function,

2616
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
and those functions

2617
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
are virtual,

2618
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
dot,

2619
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I don't know,

2620
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
a new virtual,

2621
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
and now it can go into the loop,

2622
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
you change the same name

2623
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
with each loop,

2624
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and it travels through the code,

2625
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
and in the end

2626
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
you return the context,

2627
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
and in the meantime

2628
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
it executes it specifically

2629
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
for your language,

2630
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
and in the end

2631
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
you get the context object,

2632
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
and then all the resources

2633
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
are loaded,

2634
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
and then it's the same game again,

2635
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
it's the same state,

2636
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
in this state you can't run away,

2637
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
it's quite simple,

2638
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
and the calculation

2639
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
of the delta happens again,

2640
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
what exactly happens,

2641
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
it's the same in CAS,

2642
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
in CAS it's a div,

2643
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
or a preview,

2644
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
that tells you what it's going to do,

2645
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
so you can see the div,

2646
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
and it's an app

2647
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
that applies directly to the system.

2648
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And where does

2649
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
it come from?

2650
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
When you think people will listen to it for a long time.

2651
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
No, no.

2652
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Look,

2653
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
you know,

2654
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I'm also not an expert

2655
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
on some bugs in some jams

2656
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
from people who found them,

2657
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
so I'm still watching the documentary.

2658
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Damn it,

2659
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I feel like we have to start

2660
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
with...

2661
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I feel like we need to talk about it until the end.

2662
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Let's wrap it up.

2663
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
There are more than 1000 questions.

2664
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Let's talk about CDKs, Cloud Development Kits.

2665
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Yes.

2666
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Can I make it possible?

2667
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Yes.

2668
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Pulumi supports a lot of languages

2669
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
and has the same system of providers

2670
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
that can work with larger clouds.

2671
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Of course, you will also have AWS

2672
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
and CDKs.

2673
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
You can also write AWS

2674
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
in JavaScript.

2675
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Without Pulumi.

2676
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Yes.

2677
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You can define it in code.

2678
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
You can define AWS

2679
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
because AWS is old.

2680
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Let's say that

2681
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
CloudFormation is not enough for you.

2682
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You want more dynamics.

2683
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
It is the last step

2684
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
when you can solve it.

2685
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Do you need this dynamics?

2686
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
For example,

2687
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
if you have a platform

2688
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
that generates

2689
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
full shops

2690
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
dynamically

2691
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and then you want to generate

2692
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
configuration from some settings

2693
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
and then you have to loop

2694
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
and generate definitions

2695
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
so you can apply them.

2696
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Is this QSK?

2697
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Do you do large-scale deployment?

2698
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
For example, we have a custom e-commerce platform.

2699
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
We developed it.

2700
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
It is single-tenant.

2701
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
This means that

2702
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
the system was developed

2703
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
for one customer,

2704
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
but now we have a million of them.

2705
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
A sales engineer

2706
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
or a door call

2707
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
has a split screen

2708
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
that says,

2709
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
great, we have a new customer.

2710
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
He has a plan.

2711
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
This is his domain.

2712
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Let's say it is a very popular thing.

2713
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Maybe he has his own store

2714
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
or he is deploying.

2715
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
One of the things

2716
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
is that it has to be part

2717
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
of the DNS record in CloudFlare.

2718
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
If you want to have

2719
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
another class that is his domain,

2720
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
it has to match the IP.

2721
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
When all this happens,

2722
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
you either tell the sales engineer

2723
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
what to do

2724
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
or send a feedback.

2725
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You can do this.

2726
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Another example is

2727
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
that we have a complex system

2728
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
with 60 microservices.

2729
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
All these microservices

2730
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
talk to each other

2731
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
via PubSub.

2732
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Then there are topics and subscriptions.

2733
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
How will you ensure

2734
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
that this complex matrix

2735
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
of PubSub and subscription

2736
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
is connected to Google Cloud?

2737
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
It is difficult.

2738
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Then you say,

2739
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
here is a file from a microservice

2740
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
and you say that this microservice

2741
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
depends on this microservice

2742
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
and listens to this subscription

2743
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
and sends messages to this topic.

2744
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Then you select this

2745
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
and you know what to generate.

2746
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
This can be part of your library

2747
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
and you can work

2748
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
with one microservice or 100.

2749
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
This is also a use case.

2750
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
In practice,

2751
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
this is a very good tool

2752
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
to learn Cloud.

2753
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
If you ask me.

2754
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Because it is difficult

2755
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
to traverse

2756
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
through a complex database

2757
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
and test something.

2758
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
It takes a lot of time.

2759
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I would learn Cloud three times

2760
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
slower

2761
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
and test some features

2762
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
from suppliers

2763
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
if I didn't use these tools.

2764
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Then I say,

2765
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I'm interested in Linode

2766
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
and I call Linode provider

2767
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
and how to combine it with Cloudflare

2768
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
and I have the same interface.

2769
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Maybe the name is a little different

2770
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
because I'm looking for a different product.

2771
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But it's all the same.

2772
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I don't have to go back and forth

2773
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
and click up and down.

2774
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And you know,

2775
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
let's say you have Cloudflare

2776
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
and 12 DNS connections.

2777
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Everything works,

2778
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
but you won't delete them.

2779
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I click on them and say apply

2780
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
and then I delete them

2781
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
when I play something.

2782
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I have to say something

2783
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
explicitly.

2784
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You are talking about

2785
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
the providers you choose

2786
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
for Pulumni and Terraform.

2787
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
If there are

2788
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
these recipes

2789
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
that people

2790
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
make themselves

2791
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
or their companies make

2792
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
and for example

2793
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
if I wanted to

2794
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
make coffee

2795
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
with Terraform

2796
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
or with Pulumni

2797
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
or whatever.

2798
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
You can take those recipes

2799
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
and use them,

2800
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
you don't have to do it yourself.

2801
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
How stable

2802
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
and official are those recipes?

2803
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
The companies

2804
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
support the providers

2805
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
themselves for these tools.

2806
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Google or

2807
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
AWS team

2808
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
provides

2809
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
the provider

2810
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
plugin

2811
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
that is completely up-to-date

2812
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
and that is also automatically generated.

2813
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
It's not a one-time thing.

2814
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
That's why

2815
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
they are interested in

2816
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
giving you the interface

2817
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
so you can make cash.

2818
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Terraform

2819
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
and Pulumni have a catalog

2820
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
of all these providers.

2821
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Some are official

2822
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and most are Pulumni

2823
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
plus providers.

2824
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Some are unofficial

2825
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
and some are

2826
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
community-based.

2827
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
That's huge.

2828
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
The documentation is standardized

2829
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
and I think

2830
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
it's easier

2831
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
to look at the provider's documentation

2832
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
and sometimes

2833
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
click through

2834
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
the dashboards.

2835
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
You can't see the dashboard.

2836
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You know what the problem is?

2837
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
You create a VPC

2838
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and you click on VPC

2839
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
or project and it stops

2840
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
asynchronously.

2841
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I'm working on something else and I see

2842
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
it's ready and it's been 5 minutes.

2843
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Now I have Kubernetes

2844
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
and I click on Kubernetes cluster

2845
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
and it stops.

2846
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
If I use this tool

2847
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
it's asynchronous.

2848
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
That's my dependency.

2849
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
It also calculates the tree

2850
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
and that's it.

2851
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I have a scary thought

2852
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
about these toolings.

2853
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
You can publish everything.

2854
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I wanted to say

2855
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
when you go with

2856
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
CDK or Terraform

2857
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
when you loop

2858
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
through some resources

2859
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
for example

2860
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
if you don't fuck up a token

2861
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
it does a transaction.

2862
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
You can't say

2863
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
let's go back in time.

2864
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
You can say

2865
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
sorry, maybe

2866
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I didn't have enough credit on my credit card

2867
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
or whatever

2868
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
and it will cut you off

2869
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
and you lost access permission.

2870
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
There are still

2871
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
some tools like that.

2872
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
You can't say

2873
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
this is checkpoint in time

2874
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
and now I will lock it.

2875
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
That's definitely

2876
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
when you get a plan

2877
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
we will do those things

2878
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
like when you worked

2879
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
on 23 virtual machines

2880
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
you got a quota

2881
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
and you have to send them

2882
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
an email to increase the quota

2883
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
and then it resolves automatically

2884
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
and sometimes it doesn't

2885
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
when it increases.

2886
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
These are just

2887
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
technological problems.

2888
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
You can't solve

2889
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
everything.

2890
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
One thing is

2891
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
you have to be prepared

2892
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
what will happen

2893
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
when you make a mistake.

2894
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
In the end

2895
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
if you make a mistake

2896
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
let's say in staging

2897
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
if the infrastructure

2898
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
blocks all

2899
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
colleagues working on the front end

2900
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
it has a quick

2901
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
impact on velocity.

2902
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
You have to be prepared.

2903
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
It's definitely not

2904
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
like we will try it on staging.

2905
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
No, no.

2906
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
You have to play at home.

2907
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
If you want to save some

2908
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
amount of GPU on E20

2909
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
let's do it with Terraform.

2910
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
No, I mean

2911
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
when you connect the machines

2912
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
there won't be more

2913
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and you will pay 50 cents for that.

2914
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Then you can go

2915
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
play with the kids

2916
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
and come back.

2917
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
These are just use cases.

2918
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
You need one more

2919
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
tool.

2920
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
So Terraform

2921
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
not Atlantis?

2922
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Atlantis is

2923
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
an open source version

2924
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
of Terraform Cloud

2925
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
and NVZero.

2926
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
That means you can

2927
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
on your server

2928
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
enter the keys

2929
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
and it will do the evaluations

2930
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
and it's a GitHub bot.

2931
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
These are the same things.

2932
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
It looks at the repositories

2933
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
when it sees who is doing Terraform changes

2934
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
it takes the code

2935
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
and divs it

2936
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
and then in GitHub

2937
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
it will tell you

2938
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
what will be changed.

2939
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
The good thing is

2940
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
that it's self-hosted

2941
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
and it works well.

2942
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Although

2943
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
this Terraform-specific server

2944
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
doesn't really

2945
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
fit in the

2946
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
pool of requests.

2947
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
There is documentation

2948
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
on this topic.

2949
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
But

2950
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
you need to research

2951
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
and test.

2952
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Two more hours and you can go.

2953
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Here

2954
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
we don't have

2955
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
as much preparation as in the episode

2956
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
but I will tell you more.

2957
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
You said that.

2958
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
One hour and ten minutes

2959
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
and then we talked for another hour.

2960
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That's why you live

2961
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
with these tasks.

2962
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I will

2963
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
explain Tomi

2964
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
and then we will

2965
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
draw a picture

2966
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
for the clouds.

2967
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
What is crossplane?

2968
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
You wrote it yourself at the end

2969
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
but it's so sexy and sci-fi

2970
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that

2971
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
you have to explain it.

2972
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Ok, but I will

2973
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
explain it for a long time.

2974
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I really have to go.

2975
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
No!

2976
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
We were once

2977
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
at IBM

2978
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
mainframe.

2979
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Applications were deployed

2980
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
in such a way that it was

2981
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
very similar to

2982
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
modern orchestrators like

2983
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Kubernetes. You said

2984
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
this is an app, these are parameters of the app.

2985
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
There was a dashboard, you wrote

2986
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
a note to the staff and then the mainframe

2987
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
said this is an app.

2988
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
This is now deployed

2989
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and maybe it has high availability.

2990
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I don't know. I didn't work with it.

2991
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
It was expensive.

2992
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
It's not something you have at home.

2993
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I worked in research

2994
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
and that's it.

2995
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
How does Kubernetes work?

2996
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
It works like this.

2997
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
You have Kubernetes

2998
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
which is not self-hosted, it's in the cloud.

2999
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
It's managed.

3000
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
When you

3001
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
type

3002
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
kubectl apply

3003
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
you want to

3004
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
have a container running.

3005
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Whatever happens

3006
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
a JSON is sent

3007
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
to the Kubernetes app.

3008
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Kubernetes saves

3009
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
its store.

3010
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
It looks

3011
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
at the object.

3012
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
It's just an object. It has a version

3013
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
and a type of object and parameters

3014
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
and then it calculates

3015
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
how it will make it happen.

3016
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
It will make a pod

3017
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
that will run in a container

3018
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
like an engineering slave.

3019
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Great.

3020
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
And then

3021
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
what people have done

3022
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
is you can

3023
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
have versions

3024
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and types in Kubernetes

3025
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
like pod, service, deployment

3026
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
stateful set, daemon set

3027
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
These are built-in objects.

3028
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
The schema is

3029
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
built-in and

3030
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
every Kubernetes has it.

3031
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
What you can do is

3032
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
custom

3033
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
definition of these resources.

3034
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
You can also

3035
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
have an auto

3036
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
version of one object

3037
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
type

3038
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I don't know

3039
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
podcast episode

3040
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
For example, podcast episode.

3041
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
When you put it in

3042
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Kubernetes doesn't know

3043
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
what to do with it because

3044
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
it doesn't have a

3045
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
program

3046
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
so it doesn't know

3047
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
when it comes to Kubernetes

3048
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
it will pick it up and do something.

3049
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
If you want to, you can write

3050
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
something called operator.

3051
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Operators listen

3052
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
to changes in specific types

3053
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
of objects

3054
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
and you can write

3055
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
auto operator and when you

3056
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
put it in podcast, it will

3057
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
pick it up and then

3058
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
it will start to create

3059
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
objects on Kubernetes

3060
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
or it can do anything

3061
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
it can order a pizza

3062
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
depending on the conditions

3063
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
of the operator.

3064
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
What is a cross-plane?

3065
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
You have a Kubernetes cluster

3066
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
you install a cross-plane

3067
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
operator

3068
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
inside it

3069
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
you want to have an

3070
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
AVS provider, these are the keys

3071
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
so the provider can work

3072
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
and then you can

3073
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
write in java

3074
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
for example EC2

3075
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
virtual code

3076
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Kubernetes apply

3077
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
and the object goes to Kubernetes

3078
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
because the cross-plane

3079
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
operator

3080
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
got the message

3081
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
one object has changed

3082
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
and it looks at you and says

3083
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
oh yeah, someone

3084
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
wants to have

3085
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
EC2 virtual code

3086
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
or some changes to

3087
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
one of the

3088
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
AVS services

3089
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
and then as a program

3090
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
it gets the secrets

3091
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
that you put in the configuration

3092
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
and

3093
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
creates it in

3094
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
this cluster

3095
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
so you can with Kubernetes

3096
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
provision

3097
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
all the providers

3098
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
in the cloud you have.

3099
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
But maybe

3100
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
it doesn't sound

3101
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
like a far-fetched idea

3102
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
but it's just

3103
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
a slim layer of technology

3104
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
that we described before.

3105
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
But on a very similar

3106
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
project if you run Kafka

3107
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
you have this Kafka Streams

3108
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
and it's a Kafka

3109
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
operator for Kubernetes

3110
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
and first you install this operator

3111
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
then you say

3112
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Kubernetes wants to have a new Kafka topic

3113
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
wants to have a new Kafka broker

3114
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
and then this operator

3115
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
inside Kubernetes will create

3116
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
an object and if it works

3117
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
for managing Kafka

3118
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
or Cassandra or whatever

3119
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
the same concept will work for managing

3120
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
the cloud and that's the

3121
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
overlap that Crossplane

3122
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
provides. The selling point is

3123
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
when you put a lot of cash

3124
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
and depict a team in Kubernetes

3125
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
because it's a very complex system

3126
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
then it's logical

3127
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
that it's also connected

3128
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
so it can still work with it.

3129
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I think

3130
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
it's a very interesting concept

3131
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I haven't

3132
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
tested it

3133
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I watched a lot of demos

3134
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
and I understand how it works

3135
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
from scratch because in the end

3136
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
it's just a slim layer

3137
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
of existing tooling

3138
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
but yeah, it's really sci-fi.

3139
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Andras, last thoughts.

3140
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Last thoughts.

3141
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Did you know that there's

3142
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
AWS Snowmobile?

3143
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
AWS sends disk drives

3144
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
so you can upload data to S3

3145
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
it's something like that

3146
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
and there's also

3147
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
AWS Ground Station

3148
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
so you can hire a ground station

3149
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
for your satellites

3150
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
AWS has it

3151
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
yeah, you have satellites

3152
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
and robotics

3153
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
you can look at the product. Very interesting.

3154
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
These are really

3155
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
your last thoughts.

3156
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
What do you think about this last thought?

3157
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Thank you because you didn't go

3158
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
too deep into technology

3159
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
but you went very high.

3160
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

3161
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
That's good, that's good.

3162
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Let's try these things

3163
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
everyone who's interested

3164
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
in infrastructure

3165
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
go and create an account

3166
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
on Linode, Vultr

3167
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
DigitalOcean

3168
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
and play around

3169
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
with Pulumi, Terraform

3170
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
and real Baobab

3171
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
and something new

3172
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
and play around

3173
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
with it

3174
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
and definitely

3175
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
it will help you

3176
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
a lot

3177
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
and maybe also for your project.

3178
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
That's great.

3179
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Andras,

3180
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
thank you so much

3181
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
for taking the time

3182
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
to talk to us.

3183
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Thank you.

3184
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Thank you.

3185
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I will be very happy

3186
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
if you give us

3187
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
feedback on this episode

3188
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
if you tell us what we forgot to say

3189
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
if you tell us

3190
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
how we can

3191
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
continue this work.

3192
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I assume there are a lot of topics

3193
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
that are related

3194
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
so if we didn't start today

3195
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
every feedback is very welcome

3196
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
share it with your colleagues and friends

3197
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
and yeah

3198
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Thank you very much, Andras.

3199
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Thank you.
