00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, this is the 6th episode of the podcast in Grodje.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today with me is Dr. Mateja Berlič-Brunčič,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that's him from the park, if I'm not mistaken.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, thank you.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And today we are in a completely new space on the tour,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which is a bit different from our co-working in Ljubljana,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
where we didn't have that before.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, there will be some background noise,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so that you can hear me better.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, that's it.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I wrote some notes,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and I would like to give you an opportunity to introduce yourself,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
what you are doing at the moment,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then we will go deeper.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
As you said, my name is Mateja.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For some time now,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
for 15 years, I have been present at the Split as Sparkyca,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
so since the times of Kornka,

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the Slovenian version of Twitter,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and blogospheres and blogs and stuff like that.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where do I start now?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I would like to change the world of engineering,

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
make it perhaps more modern, different,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
even in our Slovenian space.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, I am trying to talk and cooperate here,

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and show, perhaps, how it can be done differently.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The topics that interest me are everything from engineering,

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
technology itself, to people, a lot of people,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
leadership, management, you name it.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yesterday was also the conclusion of the Maribor conference,

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which is a fork of five hours,

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which started in Ljubljana,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but then was prepared by a team from Maribor.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And yesterday was the conclusion of another successful season,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
which ended with the transfer from the blockchain,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and with a change in the blockchain,

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but it also worked nicely.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I would like to tell you a little bit about my experience with five hours.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I saw that you were very active in the discussions that you had,

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and then you started some video streams.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I see that you were also very active there.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is your experience with five hours?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I believe in satisfaction,

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and satisfaction is something that fills me with energy,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and with that, five hours is magic.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It seems to me that I come home very hyped,

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know what else to do.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now, to be honest, I have been preparing for a long time.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Today, when I was still thinking about sports,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
because at that time I was still healthy,

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and that respect is part of the team Iko Lajsa,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
with whom I worked, and he was my student.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We are somehow connected,

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and through them I followed and supported the return of knowledge to the community,

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
because we all know that the community matters,

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
we need to get to know each other, we need to help each other,

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
whether from a professional point of view or a personal point of view,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
so that we can raise the level or quality of our professional work,

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
or if we change experiences, we drink a cocktail, and so on.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now, in practice, I expressed a desire to participate in the Split Games,

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
because it is cool for me.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am an introvert, of course, I learned how to be an extrovert,

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
because it is cool for me to meet people,

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to get to know them, to spread the knowledge, experience,

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and to connect people.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And there was a time when we needed a moderator,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
because we were connected to Erne and others,

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and we have been doing this for about a year now,

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
every season, and then the corona came,

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and so there are always some challenges,

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
how to get people to come,

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
because everyone thinks that there is nothing to say,

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
until you invite them,

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and then you see that they are very interesting,

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
they have a lot of things to say.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, also from that perspective,

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think it's nice that I'm here,

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have a lot of connections,

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and I know a lot of people in the IT sphere,

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I can inspire a lot of people to come and share.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But with the corona, we said,

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
shit, we can't do this live,

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
what do we want to do?

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And we decided to do a live stream.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now, we have been recording for hours before,

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but we were in a dilemma,

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
whether to stream it,

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and support a lot of people,

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
so that they don't come live,

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
or, yes,

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and the corona didn't give us a choice.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It just seems to me,

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know,

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was a viewer,

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and I also participated in some of your discussions,

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but I have a feeling that more people,

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
in some way,

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
could join because you started streaming.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
For sure.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Maybe some other people,

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
if we didn't come,

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
they still participated.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's definitely easier to come home as a guest,

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think it's even easier now,

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in these years,

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
we have a family connection,

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and there is a lot of logistics,

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
if you want to come from point A to point B,

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
to 7 and 5,

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and then home.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I agree,

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
maybe it was our core value,

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
networking,

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
bonding live,

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
maybe that's why we didn't want to.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I agree,

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
we are definitely motivated today,

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
it's more convenient,

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
more natural for us.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's discuss

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
how to attract

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
a larger population

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to meetups,

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
what are you doing?

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm active,

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm recruiting.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Recruiting for Split Nemurice,

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and part of my job

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
was hiring or recruiting,

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and through

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
getting to know people,

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I attracted them to Split Nemurice,

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
even though we weren't perfect fit,

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I liked that they knew

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
that something was going on in Maribor,

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and I attracted them to Split Nemurice,

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
either as a teacher,

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
or to come and listen,

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
or to find out that something is going on.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean, it's nothing,

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
people themselves won't come.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
When you make a product,

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you talk to the devil.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
With all these impulses,

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
it's hard to be

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
on top of things.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes,

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I mean, in front of this stage...

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You know.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm also interested

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
in quality production

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
in Split Nemurice Maribor,

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think that's something

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that stands out from others.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Streaming on two platforms,

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
then CGP,

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
graphic design,

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think that's top-notch.

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The story of Peljana Skozna

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is really top-notch,

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
with CGP, top-notch production.

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I would like to thank you,

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
because those who do it,

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
research it,

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
maybe you experienced it

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
as an experiment,

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
because you have to know

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
that we are professionals,

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
there's no money involved,

171
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
it's our money involved,

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and then you look

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
where you can make

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
a lot of Split Nemurice,

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
so that it becomes,

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
not only Split Nemurice Maribor,

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
but also Split Nemurice Slovenska,

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
which is also in Ljubljana,

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
in Zajevac.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If we change it.

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If we change it, definitely.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It will stand.

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well,

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can start the debate

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
in a different direction,

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
when you say that you meet

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
a lot of people at these events,

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
a lot of new people,

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
a lot of new topics,

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
new technologies.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yesterday I met

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
three students,

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
two from Fria,

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
one from Tojini,

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and I will try

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to connect this topic,

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and then there was a debate

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
about ending Fax.

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And you are

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
a PhD student in computer science,

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
so I will give you

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
a piece of advice.

203
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will try to connect this topic,

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and I will say that

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
those students yesterday

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
were like,

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
yes, you know,

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I would like to work with theory,

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and we are grinding here,

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and we are not interested,

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and it would be more interesting

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to start working,

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and someone would say,

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
oh, I will not finish summer school.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But you went all the way,

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and I said,

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
ok, I will try from my perspective,

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and I would like to know

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
what you would like to do.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I said that I went to study,

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
because I did not know what to do.

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I mean,

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
my background is from high school,

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and I am interested in Mars,

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and it was at home,

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
here, as you can see,

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
it was like,

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
if you do not come to the end,

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
there is always a call.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you will not have to work?

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, I did not bring a lot of work

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
to my family,

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
but it was like,

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
no, I want to be something.

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I do not know yet what,

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but I want something,

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and then I went to high school

238
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
to get a little wider.

239
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I started at four years old,

240
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I said, ok, I am interested in technology,

241
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and then art.

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And now what to do with it?

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then I got a little insight,

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
to see how it would be,

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
because at that time,

246
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
in my crazy head,

247
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
in high school,

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I imagined that I would do advertising,

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
digital animation,

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and I would combine technology and art,

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and I do not know,

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
but there were a lot of theories,

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and there was a lot of mathematics,

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I also experienced physics,

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
which I like a little,

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but not physics.

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, you have to grind,

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and then you think,

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
why do I have six mathematics here,

260
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and some curved integrals,

261
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and all those eggs.

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Now, when I look back,

263
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I see,

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
FACS gave me

265
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
some tools,

266
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
some tools,

267
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and a way of thinking,

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
which I can now apply.

269
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Not so much practical things,

270
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
at FACS you can not learn to program

271
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
production,

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
but you can learn

273
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
a little bit of science,

274
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
a little bit of scientific thinking,

275
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
you need to put some hypothesis,

276
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
how can you verify

277
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
this hypothesis,

278
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
or verify it.

279
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And from that insight,

280
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
it seems to me,

281
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
it gave me

282
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
a way to find myself,

283
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I would say.

284
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But then,

285
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
at the end of that

286
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
post-graduate work,

287
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I did not know what to do,

288
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
because at that time there were only two companies,

289
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
so I knew,

290
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
one was Hermes Softlab,

291
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and the other was something else.

292
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Anyway, I did not feel there,

293
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and the opportunity came,

294
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
a young researcher,

295
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and I said, yes, I can do it,

296
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I will come back, I will be a researcher,

297
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
because it is cool.

298
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But that experience was not so good.

299
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It depends a lot on a young researcher,

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
on the laboratory

301
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
in which he joins,

302
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
on the mentor, how much time he has,

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
on the whole setup,

304
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
on the time,

305
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
maybe for me it was

306
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
not a very good time

307
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
to be a young researcher,

308
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and then two years as an assistant.

309
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But I got a lesson

310
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that I am not for this world.

311
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Although I managed to finish the thing,

312
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
if nothing else,

313
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I did not finish it.

314
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So from this point of view,

315
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think it is an accomplishment,

316
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and this PhD is also a joker,

317
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
so usually

318
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I do not give up,

319
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
but if someone

320
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
approaches me,

321
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
if someone treats me

322
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
as a douchebag,

323
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and tries to put people

324
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
in some transition,

325
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
they will call me a joker.

326
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But that's just my opinion,

327
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I do not judge people

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
on paper, people are all different.

329
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Now,

330
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
many times students ask me

331
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
what am I going to do in the master's,

332
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
why am I doing a PhD,

333
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and I tell them,

334
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
go do it if you know why you are doing it.

335
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Because yes, grinding is not good,

336
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and if you see a hole at the end of the tunnel,

337
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and you know it is there,

338
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
why is it there,

339
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you will not have a problem.

340
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you want to get a paper

341
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and you want to connect

342
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
with mentors,

343
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
because you have great mentors,

344
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and great lectures,

345
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
just do it.

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you like the academic sphere,

347
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
which is a bit special,

348
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
just do it.

349
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If you do not know why you are doing it,

350
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
then don't do it.

351
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's go back a bit,

352
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
do you think

353
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that you have,

354
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
when you see other

355
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
technical managers,

356
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
do you think that you have

357
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
some of those skills

358
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
that you acquired

359
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
through the academic world,

360
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
which maybe otherwise would not have?

361
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Do you see that people

362
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
worked hard,

363
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and maybe if you went through it again,

364
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it would be easier?

365
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do you think,

366
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
what can you use as a manager,

367
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
a technical manager?

368
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
First of all, abstract thinking,

369
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
how to make something

370
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
out of some specific things,

371
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
then look at it more abstractly,

372
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
then draw something,

373
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
then think about it,

374
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and maybe connect different areas,

375
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
because they are connected,

376
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
some patterns,

377
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I definitely see it as a problem.

378
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Then maybe when I went through

379
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
this research cycle,

380
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
in a way,

381
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
these cycles,

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
you look at what you have to do,

383
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
how to check it as soon as possible,

384
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
because everything we do

385
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is individual,

386
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
even if something happens in production,

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
something goes wrong,

388
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
it is our own fault.

389
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Such things,

390
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
such scientific principles,

391
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
solving problems,

392
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
breaking down problems,

393
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
writing documentation.

394
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Come on!

395
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Also, sketching,

396
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the way you imagine people,

397
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
do you think it is easier?

398
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes,

399
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
especially when you learn

400
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
to imagine things in a structured way,

401
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
maybe write it as an article,

402
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
because documentation is also

403
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
like an article,

404
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
to imagine a subject to someone else,

405
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to imagine a problem,

406
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
because someone who is not in our field

407
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
probably does not know all the details,

408
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but the problem you extract from it

409
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
is easy to put together.

410
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When I was in Maribor,

411
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
honestly,

412
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I am 6 years old,

413
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
when I was in Maribor,

414
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
we went to my grandmother,

415
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will record this podcast,

416
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I think she had

417
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
a lot of discussions,

418
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I talked to the doctor

419
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
about computers,

420
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
what would she ask,

421
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
if she is interested in computers,

422
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and then at the end

423
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
we listened to Kingston

424
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
the whole time,

425
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and we listened to Kingston,

426
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and when I tried to turn it on,

427
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we were 5 in the morning,

428
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and I said,

429
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you are crazy,

430
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
so from this field

431
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I have some,

432
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I expected to have

433
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
more intelligent questions,

434
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but I will go back to

435
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Codecats, because it seems

436
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
very interesting to me,

437
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and then I will go to

438
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Demi, tell me,

439
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you put a lot of effort

440
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
into Codecats,

441
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and you tried to

442
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
inspire young people

443
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
to go into

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the technical waters,

445
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
how do you see this,

446
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
how do we attract

447
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
young people,

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
or how do we inspire them

449
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to follow the path

450
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
in technology,

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
when you yourself

452
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
have a lot of work,

453
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and it seems to you

454
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
that we have to let them

455
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
go their own way,

456
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and they are lost,

457
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and it seems to you

458
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that it would be better

459
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
to introduce them

460
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
to the tech space,

461
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
to have different jobs,

462
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
to have developers,

463
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
to have project managers,

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and it seems to you

465
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
that they could start

466
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
with Codecats.

467
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, that's a good start.

468
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I know how it was for me

469
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
when I signed up for the

470
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
computer science course,

471
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and I didn't have a good basis.

472
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I said, ok, I will survive

473
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
the first year, and if I get

474
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
an A, I'm good.

475
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The second year was ok,

476
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
if I repeat the first year,

477
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm good.

478
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's not that hard,

479
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and I'm doing great.

480
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Maybe, I mean,

481
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
for girls, I know better,

482
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
all the girls are the same,

483
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
you need a bit more motivation,

484
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
it's ok, you can fail,

485
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you don't have the power to just

486
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
realize what's going to happen.

487
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We were getting questions,

488
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
why are you doing workshops

489
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
only for girls?

490
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Codecats was created

491
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and was created with the help

492
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
of Alja Isakovic,

493
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
she was driving it,

494
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and we realized

495
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
that we need

496
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
a safe haven.

497
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Girls like it,

498
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
maybe we just think

499
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that someone is judging us,

500
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
judging us,

501
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and you don't know anything.

502
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And we showed

503
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
the proof in the end

504
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
that if girls are together,

505
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
they feel safer,

506
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
they experiment a bit,

507
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
they don't feel stupid.

508
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And we inspired them

509
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to come and try

510
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
something that was

511
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
totally out of comfort zone.

512
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Even if they copied

513
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
some code,

514
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it's not that bad.

515
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There are some obstacles,

516
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but it's possible.

517
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And after the workshops,

518
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
people asked

519
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
what to do next,

520
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and we said

521
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
let's do some

522
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
meetups,

523
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
we are both in technology,

524
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
let's do some work together,

525
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
learn to program,

526
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and we chose Python,

527
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
which was easy, interesting.

528
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And we got some time

529
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
on a weekly basis,

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
we had cohorts,

531
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
it's true that

532
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
all the ideas

533
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
are heard very well,

534
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
until you have to commit.

535
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And today,

536
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
you need time, energy,

537
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and you have to overcome

538
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the first obstacles

539
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
when you have to solve

540
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
a bigger problem,

541
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
when you have to debug

542
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
something for 3 hours.

543
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And then the girls

544
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
were like,

545
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
today I can't do this,

546
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
today I can't do that.

547
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And then we had a group

548
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and each group went to

549
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
a new Python installation.

550
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We asked each other

551
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
to help us install Python

552
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
in each new group.

553
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And in the last group,

554
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
we decided to do a project,

555
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
which started

556
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
in Code Week.

557
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And we decided

558
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
to make an app

559
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
for

560
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
events

561
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
that will happen

562
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
in Code Week.

563
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
A real project.

564
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
A real project.

565
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
No money involved.

566
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Again,

567
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I said that

568
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
it was a big responsibility

569
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
for the beginners.

570
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
For example,

571
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Erika Pogorilac joined

572
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and then Goran Blažič.

573
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We were a bit more

574
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
experienced,

575
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
but others,

576
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
who were newbies,

577
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
were a bit behind.

578
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But it was our successful project.

579
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know if it's still alive

580
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
or if it was replaced by others.

581
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But we saw that

582
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
if you work with girls

583
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
in a different way,

584
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and if they feel good...

585
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You can help them,

586
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you can make

587
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
a safe...

588
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Safe for them, yes.

589
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
A safe

590
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
social environment

591
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and give them your experience.

592
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
For me,

593
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
it's a stupid question.

594
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If you ask me three times,

595
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll answer you three times.

596
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's how we reduced

597
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
the barrier.

598
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
A few girls saw

599
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that it's possible

600
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to work with more technical companies.

601
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think Google

602
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
is a good scholarship.

603
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
For me,

604
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
if we converted one,

605
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
we did something.

606
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I understand.

607
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's true that we

608
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
told the girls

609
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that it's not about

610
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
learning how to program

611
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and being a programmer.

612
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Things are a bit more complex.

613
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It takes time and effort

614
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
to become an engineer

615
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
or a developer.

616
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Let me ask you.

617
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The purpose

618
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
of the projects

619
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
you mentioned

620
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
was to teach programming

621
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
or to show people

622
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
what's going on

623
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
in the development of technical products.

624
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think

625
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
a lot of people

626
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
will try to program

627
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and realize that

628
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
programming is not for them

629
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and that project management

630
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
is more for them

631
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and they'll find a way to do it.

632
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Do you think this approach

633
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
will benefit the industry?

634
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sure it will.

635
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There are a lot of stereotypes.

636
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
A developer sits in a room

637
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
with two monitors

638
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and doesn't know what's going on.

639
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
No.

640
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We've been to a lot of companies

641
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and talked about it.

642
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's not a sole purpose.

643
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Teaching someone

644
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
how to program

645
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
takes a lot of time.

646
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I have to work from home

647
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and share tutorials.

648
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's not a follow-up.

649
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Life happens.

650
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
If you're not committed

651
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and don't have a drive,

652
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
you can't do it.

653
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
On the other hand,

654
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
we've shown that

655
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
you don't have to

656
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
ask your colleagues

657
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to understand

658
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
what they're talking about.

659
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We had designers

660
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and project managers in the group.

661
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Maybe they found

662
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
a common language in the company.

663
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
OK.

664
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I have another question.

665
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
How will the culture

666
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
of engineering

667
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
in Slovenia change?

668
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
How do you feel

669
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
as the Director of Engineering

670
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
at Databox?

671
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Can we talk about that?

672
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Of course.

673
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We'll change it by one percent.

674
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's a topic

675
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
that I talk about

676
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in various companies.

677
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
First of all,

678
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
it's not about the staff.

679
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's not about the staff.

680
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Then you break it down

681
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and you realize that

682
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
the staff is important.

683
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Today, staff is

684
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
people.

685
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
People need

686
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
a good education.

687
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
They need to be comfortable,

688
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
they need to be educated,

689
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
they need to have a culture.

690
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and a lot of things that triggered you to come to this company, for example.

691
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And one of the things I see coming up again and again is that people say,

692
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
yes, this company has some good engineers, it has some interesting product,

693
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
but it doesn't have some technical management at the level that it could grow,

694
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
that it could have some breakthroughs, that it could have some talent again.

695
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And I would like to hear from you how this is going to happen.

696
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
If I tell you how it's going to change, the easiest way is to hire all the people

697
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
who would like to change, because change comes from within.

698
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You can change on LinkedIn, you can like as much as you want,

699
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
but if you don't apply to the company, it's futile.

700
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We can do that, we can open to work, I don't know if my boss would be happy.

701
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Otherwise, I think, as you said, it has to come from within.

702
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
People need to grow, they need to find ambassadors, allies,

703
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and they also have to push back on their own in some way in management.

704
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's much easier if you live with a new company,

705
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
in such a way of thinking, to make sure that people are assets,

706
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that you have to work with them, on them,

707
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that you don't have to play chess with them,

708
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and just pass them the ball as you like in the end.

709
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's important how they feel, how they feel used,

710
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
how much value they bring, how they feel heard,

711
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and how much feedback they get, because we all get feedback,

712
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
we all have some nice PGs, sweet things, good things.

713
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And, for example, what I saw on the database,

714
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the meetings are weekly, one-on-one.

715
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well, if we take 15 minutes, it's not an operation,

716
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
but I talk to my engineers about what's cool in our relationship,

717
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
what's cool in the way we work, what's cool in working with others,

718
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
what's cool and not cool in communication with the inside team,

719
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
or with the outside team, and if you do that on a weekly basis,

720
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
something is accepted.

721
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And then, when you group a team, they can move it forward,

722
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
or, in fact, when new people come in, they group them forward,

723
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and that's how culture moves forward.

724
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The other thing I talk about a lot is radical candor.

725
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And I live for that, because you're, let's say,

726
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
nothing, nowhere is perfect,

727
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and it's true that you can express,

728
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that you're a dissenter, that you express a different opinion,

729
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
that that opinion is heard,

730
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't have the brain to respect it,

731
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't have the brain to look at the table,

732
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and look at the different patterns, at the problem,

733
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
because I don't know the specific patterns.

734
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
If you have a company, let's say, a banal example,

735
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
if you have a company that is 99.9% male engineers,

736
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
you will describe everything in the documentation,

737
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
he does that, he does that,

738
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
where are we going, and so on.

739
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And I say, I'm just a guy,

740
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
we're not just guys, let's say.

741
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So that others can feel included,

742
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so that they have everything in mind,

743
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
so that no one else exists.

744
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Then, for example, one thing that I try to emphasize

745
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
is that we are all one company,

746
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
because there is a natural tendency to become a camp.

747
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh, that's sales, that's marketing.

748
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But each of us has his own piece of puzzle

749
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
that he has to contribute to the whole picture.

750
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And if we draw some kind of empathy from other teams,

751
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
then we will understand that we have an image,

752
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
we need a name and an email that we get,

753
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
so that we understand that they have a slightly different payment,

754
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and that they are not fools if they don't know how to speak our language,

755
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
because we don't know their language.

756
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And let's say we don't use some patterns,

757
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I wrote a lot about that,

758
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
because we are them, we are all us.

759
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But I think we should do everything from the inside,

760
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and then take management to a certain level for that.

761
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
The table is huge.

762
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And it will be a bit similar,

763
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because I practiced one-on-one for two weeks,

764
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and one lesson.

765
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But yes, it is mental effort.

766
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But to sit with an engineer and debate not only

767
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
his current technical challenges,

768
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
but also how he will grow in his career,

769
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
how he will grow within the company,

770
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
how he can do some side projects

771
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that will benefit his career and the company.

772
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That's a lot of effort to put in,

773
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
but these are long-term investments.

774
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You really hear about those one-on-ones,

775
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
everything from hatching to adopted cats.

776
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But it all depends on them.

777
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes, yes, it depends on them.

778
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Adopted cats.

779
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yes, but that's part of life,

780
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
but also growth and death.

781
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That's part of life.

782
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I think it pays off,

783
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
because you have to put in some effort,

784
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and if you work slowly,

785
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
then you don't need hours.

786
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Sometimes you can solve things faster.

787
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But yes, when things don't go smoothly,

788
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and it happens that things don't go smoothly,

789
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
then there is some capital that you can invest in some way.

790
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Absolutely.

791
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And you get to know people,

792
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
you understand each other,

793
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and it pays off.

794
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's what I recommend.

795
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Can we go to a related topic now?

796
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I think we started a bit, but okay.

797
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Now you know that you have management of your peers,

798
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
which means that you manage people on your level,

799
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and communicate with people on your level,

800
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
that is, with others, directors, managers.

801
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Then you have downwards management,

802
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that is, how you manage your subordinates.

803
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Then you have upper management,

804
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
that is, how you communicate with your superiors.

805
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I think we touched on the middle,

806
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and I'm very interested in how you communicate on the top.

807
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If you have a very good drawing,

808
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
then if the management doesn't see it for you,

809
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
but they know about it,

810
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
then it's not worth it.

811
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm interested in your experience with upwards management.

812
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's great if the company supports

813
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the increase of visibility of what the team is doing.

814
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Specifically, we have weekly meetings on the database.

815
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Who would have thought,

816
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't know, an hour and a half.

817
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That's a waste of time.

818
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But it's not.

819
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We recommend some key things within the team.

820
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
For example, an operation, progress of the project,

821
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
if there are any problems,

822
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and also the human side,

823
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
who we might need now,

824
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
or how we relate to the team,

825
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
or we praise someone in the team.

826
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So, for example,

827
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
upwards management gets visibility of what's going on,

828
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and who has worked a little harder this week,

829
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and who needs to be highly praised.

830
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We've already had debates,

831
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
would you still have this meeting?

832
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Would you still have it?

833
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Because in the beginning,

834
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
you can do everything asynchronously.

835
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
When we post these things in Slack,

836
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
then you can check everything,

837
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and we conclude.

838
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
If you can check everything,

839
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
you checked everything today.

840
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That's one thing.

841
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
If you check everything today,

842
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it works asynchronously.

843
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But we found value in sitting together,

844
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
at the beginning,

845
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
for five minutes,

846
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
to discuss,

847
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
to fly over,

848
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and then we debate questions.

849
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And then we have such debates,

850
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
also at the leadership level.

851
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That is,

852
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
how is the team now,

853
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
with which other team,

854
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
or where are some trainings,

855
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
or where do we need to help,

856
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
or what do we need to do as a team,

857
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
as some directors,

858
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
so that, I don't know,

859
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
we will be treated differently,

860
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
or what do we need to introduce,

861
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
or what do we need to support.

862
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So, this kind of bonding,

863
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
at the weekly level,

864
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
is a part of the upper,

865
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I mean,

866
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
management level.

867
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Then we also have a weekly one-on-one,

868
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
for example,

869
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
with the founder,

870
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
or with the VP.

871
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So,

872
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
it's not just an operative,

873
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
but today we also talk about,

874
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
for example,

875
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
if I have a challenge,

876
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
or I get feedback,

877
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
where my supervisor sees that I have a challenge,

878
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
or if it's just me,

879
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
then I remember that your team is working.

880
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, I get feedback,

881
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
that I need to support,

882
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
so that the visibility will be better.

883
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Anyway,

884
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
this is how it works with us,

885
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
one-on-one,

886
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
up,

887
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and actually down.

888
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Then,

889
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
one of the things,

890
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
maybe we are a bit specific,

891
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
is that we are distributed.

892
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So,

893
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
we have teams in America,

894
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
then we have teams,

895
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
if they can dance,

896
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
then we have a team here in Aptoide.

897
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Now,

898
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
let's say that we are a bubble,

899
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
we don't care,

900
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
honey badger don't care,

901
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
we also have weekly meetings with them,

902
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and it was like,

903
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
what did we talk about?

904
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean,

905
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
what are the connections?

906
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes.

907
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And we noticed that,

908
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
even if we only see each other,

909
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and at the beginning,

910
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't know,

911
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
after 50 minutes,

912
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
we chat,

913
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
aha,

914
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Bjeli will get a baby,

915
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
ah,

916
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Tori,

917
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and she went for a ride,

918
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it also brings us a little closer,

919
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
and again,

920
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
we have some kind of growth,

921
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
to the mail,

922
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
to the task,

923
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and it seems to me,

924
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
this is very important.

925
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
If we had been a scan slide for the first time,

926
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
we would have given it,

927
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
we could have talked even more.

928
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And this,

929
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
this is not a waste of time,

930
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you can't solve it with the mail,

931
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and you can't solve it with a picture.

932
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It would be much better anyway,

933
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and I feel alive somehow,

934
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
but you have to maintain some kind of relationship,

935
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
for it to work.

936
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Wow.

937
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
No,

938
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
good, good.

939
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's an effort,

940
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
yes,

941
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
no,

942
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
it's not the time yet,

943
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
but yes.

944
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes,

945
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
so,

946
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
we established,

947
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that you build culture from the inside,

948
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
we called ourselves,

949
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Upward Upward Management.

950
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Wait,

951
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
one more thing,

952
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
culture,

953
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
not that you build culture,

954
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
no,

955
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
no,

956
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
no,

957
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
we will now,

958
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
yes,

959
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
we will continue,

960
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
this is a topic,

961
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
we will try,

962
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
ah,

963
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
how do you see,

964
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
ok,

965
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
when you grow up,

966
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
you will need to increase,

967
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
manpower,

968
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
which you have at your disposal,

969
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
to expand the team,

970
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
everything can be increased,

971
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
which is some kind of a natural process,

972
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
how do you see,

973
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
how will you,

974
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
or how will you deal with it,

975
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
how will those patterns or culture,

976
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
which is happening,

977
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
this debate,

978
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
these relationships,

979
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
day-to-day activity,

980
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and when you grow up,

981
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
when there will be more people,

982
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
because,

983
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
when the meeting would be one and a half hours,

984
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
if everyone came to it,

985
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
it would be a three-hour meeting,

986
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
how do you see this,

987
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the scaling of these relationships,

988
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and some cultures,

989
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
which come from it,

990
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
how do you deal with it,

991
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
how do you see it?

992
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't know,

993
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
but I will be interested.

994
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I don't know,

995
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
this is a challenge.

996
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Will there be two meetings?

997
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes,

998
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
it is,

999
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
it seems to me that these are some kind of natural processes,

1000
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
bigger than all those,

1001
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
yes,

1002
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
bigger challenges.

1003
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Now,

1004
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
you know,

1005
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
when there are five people in the same room,

1006
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
everything changes,

1007
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
it is a natural state,

1008
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
you don't have to work outside.

1009
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
When you are older,

1010
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
you can maybe

1011
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
a little enforce

1012
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
this communication,

1013
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
these meetings,

1014
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
these,

1015
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't know,

1016
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
we have once a week,

1017
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
all the teams together in the same room,

1018
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
for example,

1019
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
even a 15-minute sync.

1020
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Part of this magic of culture

1021
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
is certainly lost,

1022
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
because,

1023
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
in my opinion,

1024
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I think,

1025
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
as I saw,

1026
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
like the previous company,

1027
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
is that there may also be some subcultures,

1028
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
we had a company where,

1029
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
in general,

1030
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the company may not have had such a good culture,

1031
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
but part of the team,

1032
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
which was also location-oriented,

1033
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and when we were maybe

1034
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
such people,

1035
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
who were on the line,

1036
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and then we had some

1037
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
negative feedback,

1038
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
we built a subculture,

1039
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
it is called

1040
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
a subculture of respect,

1041
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
challenging each other,

1042
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
discovering each other,

1043
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
one-on-one,

1044
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
but it was not something

1045
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
for the process,

1046
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
prescribed by the company.

1047
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I have no answer.

1048
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
For more,

1049
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
it should be,

1050
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
fuck,

1051
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
this is a challenge.

1052
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I still have one

1053
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
hypothesis,

1054
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
a theory,

1055
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
and with that I make

1056
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The Fork,

1057
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and I think that

1058
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
in development,

1059
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
in engineering,

1060
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
you start,

1061
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
let's say that

1062
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
most people start

1063
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
a student job,

1064
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
or a junior developer,

1065
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
a mid-developer,

1066
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
a developer engineer,

1067
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and then a senior,

1068
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and then there is a moment

1069
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
when you have to decide

1070
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
whether you will be

1071
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
a developer in the future,

1072
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
or you will go

1073
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
to a management position,

1074
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and I am surprised

1075
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
that you were on

1076
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The Fork

1077
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
at some point,

1078
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and then you decided

1079
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
to go to management,

1080
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
role management,

1081
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and that means

1082
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that now you are

1083
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
more or less

1084
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
only dealing with technology.

1085
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
How do you see The Fork?

1086
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I am a manager

1087
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
during the day,

1088
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and a developer at night.

1089
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I would not say

1090
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that I was on The Fork,

1091
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
because I never felt

1092
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
like a top-sheet

1093
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
A-player developer.

1094
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I always had

1095
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
this imposter syndrome.

1096
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But it seems to me

1097
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
that my power

1098
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
or my strength

1099
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
is the bond of people.

1100
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Recognizing

1101
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
some potential,

1102
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
motivating,

1103
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
challenging,

1104
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
taking a lot,

1105
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
it seems to me

1106
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
that if I have

1107
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
this empathy,

1108
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
it can help me

1109
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
on the management track.

1110
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And it seems to me

1111
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that I can contribute

1112
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
even more.

1113
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So, really,

1114
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I never had

1115
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
dilemmas

1116
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
about where to go.

1117
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It is true that

1118
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
in my life,

1119
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I said to myself

1120
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
that I do not want

1121
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
to be at the driver's seat,

1122
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I do not want to drive.

1123
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I have a certain ambition,

1124
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
there are things

1125
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I would like to do,

1126
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and I know

1127
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
that I can do it

1128
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
only when I have

1129
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
some decision power.

1130
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And I am very happy

1131
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to come to the point

1132
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
where I can help

1133
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
create everything,

1134
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
some things,

1135
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
because it seems to me

1136
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
that what I am talking about

1137
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
is important.

1138
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I am happy

1139
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
against those

1140
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
who only look

1141
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
at the numbers,

1142
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
only at productivity,

1143
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and it seems to me

1144
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
that I can balance

1145
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
that human side

1146
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
in engineering.

1147
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
For example,

1148
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
one such lesson

1149
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
was given to me

1150
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
by FACS.

1151
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
When I got the feeling

1152
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that computers,

1153
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
however they are called,

1154
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
think for themselves.

1155
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
A computer exists

1156
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
because it exists,

1157
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
because it is.

1158
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But if you look a little,

1159
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
you step back a little,

1160
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
you realize that a computer

1161
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
is a support.

1162
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Today we support

1163
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
all kinds of ideas.

1164
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
We are the ones

1165
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
who do it

1166
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
because this idea

1167
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
comes to life

1168
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
and today it works.

1169
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
We didn't do it

1170
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
just for ourselves.

1171
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And that gave me

1172
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
such a mindset

1173
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
that in all companies

1174
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
that we are,

1175
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
even if it is an IT company,

1176
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
it should be known

1177
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
that we are the ones

1178
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
who actually enable it.

1179
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We are not there

1180
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
because we are different.

1181
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
If there was an institution

1182
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
that would deal with it

1183
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
today,

1184
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
to make a top sheet

1185
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
of development,

1186
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
for example,

1187
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
we remained a support.

1188
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I would like to add

1189
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
that today

1190
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
you see IT

1191
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
more as a

1192
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
neighbor.

1193
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yes, as a neighbor.

1194
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
This is also

1195
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
an interesting topic

1196
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
because today

1197
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
you see

1198
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
that all companies

1199
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
are tech companies

1200
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
in a way.

1201
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Technology plays

1202
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
an important role.

1203
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Some companies

1204
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
openly support it,

1205
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
acknowledge it,

1206
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
focus on it,

1207
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
facilitate awareness,

1208
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
focus,

1209
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
debate, etc.

1210
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Others don't.

1211
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And there you have

1212
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
a lot of problems.

1213
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I mean,

1214
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
today I imagine

1215
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
that everything is

1216
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
a tech company

1217
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
where technology

1218
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
is at the forefront

1219
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
more than probably

1220
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
some other companies.

1221
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But I think

1222
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I know what you mean.

1223
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yes, no, hold on.

1224
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
We are working

1225
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
on the main level

1226
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
of technology.

1227
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
We want to do

1228
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
stable things.

1229
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Of course,

1230
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
we want to

1231
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
work for a few years.

1232
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But we are not

1233
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
satisfied.

1234
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yes, we have

1235
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
a top-notch

1236
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
software,

1237
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
but we don't

1238
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
have a user.

1239
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yes, I understand.

1240
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That's what I mean.

1241
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It means

1242
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that we need

1243
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
to add

1244
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
a user

1245
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
in the account

1246
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
who can

1247
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
solve

1248
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
any problem.

1249
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
We are all

1250
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
in business

1251
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to solve

1252
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
a problem,

1253
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
not just

1254
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
to solve

1255
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
a problem.

1256
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
My own

1257
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
institutions

1258
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
where people

1259
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
work

1260
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
are good

1261
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
because they

1262
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
are easy

1263
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
to research,

1264
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
because they

1265
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
develop

1266
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
new solutions,

1267
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
break through

1268
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
walls.

1269
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There are

1270
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
such companies,

1271
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
but I

1272
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
haven't worked

1273
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
in such

1274
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
companies.

1275
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I think

1276
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
we need

1277
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
to prevent

1278
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
becoming

1279
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
douchebags

1280
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and saying

1281
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
yes, yes,

1282
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
you are

1283
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
a douchebag,

1284
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
because

1285
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
you are

1286
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
a douchebag.

1287
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Let me

1288
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
start

1289
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
with another

1290
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
topic.

1291
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I think

1292
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
we have

1293
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
changed

1294
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
the comment

1295
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
on LinkedIn

1296
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
a lot,

1297
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
but Dazabox

1298
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
is

1299
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
a company

1300
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
that is

1301
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
more than

1302
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
10 years

1303
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
old,

1304
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
if I'm not

1305
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
mistaken.

1306
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It holds.

1307
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It holds.

1308
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It is

1309
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
a company

1310
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
that has

1311
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
accumulated

1312
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
technical

1313
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
debt.

1314
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It is

1315
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
a company

1316
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
that has

1317
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
accumulated

1318
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
technical debt.

1319
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It is

1320
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
a company

1321
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that has

1322
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
accumulated

1323
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
technical debt.

1324
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It is

1325
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
a company

1326
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
that has

1327
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
accumulated

1328
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
technical debt.

1329
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm

1330
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
curious

1331
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
how much

1332
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
you invest

1333
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
in your

1334
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
job

1335
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
with that.

1336
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
How do

1337
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
you solve

1338
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the problem

1339
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
of technical

1340
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
debt?

1341
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I can

1342
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
answer.

1343
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Definitely

1344
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
there is

1345
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
technical

1346
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
debt.

1347
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Now

1348
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
maybe it's

1349
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
not so

1350
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
critical

1351
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
that if we

1352
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
don't

1353
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
solve it

1354
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
at this

1355
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
moment,

1356
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
the company

1357
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
will close

1358
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
permanently,

1359
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
because

1360
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
everyone

1361
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
has a

1362
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
house

1363
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
and a

1364
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
car.

1365
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
We

1366
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
are aware

1367
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
of that.

1368
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Management

1369
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
is aware

1370
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that

1371
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
we have

1372
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
engineers

1373
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
that are

1374
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
my sparring

1375
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
partners and

1376
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I expect

1377
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
from them

1378
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
that when

1379
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
they come

1380
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
from the

1381
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
product side

1382
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and say

1383
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
hey guys

1384
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm working

1385
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
on this

1386
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
feature,

1387
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
that they

1388
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
stop

1389
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the over

1390
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
my dead

1391
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
body,

1392
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
because

1393
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
we need

1394
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
to explain

1395
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
that first

1396
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
because

1397
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
we are

1398
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
working

1399
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
on

1400
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
that.

1401
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We

1402
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
need to

1403
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
evaluate

1404
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
ourselves

1405
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
when

1406
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
it's

1407
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
necessary

1408
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and

1409
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
when

1410
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
it's

1411
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
not.

1412
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
How

1413
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
to say

1414
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
no,

1415
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
how

1416
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
to say

1417
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
yes,

1418
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
or

1419
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
no,

1420
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
now

1421
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
we

1422
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
need to

1423
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
solve

1424
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
it.

1425
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I

1426
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
think

1427
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
we

1428
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
have

1429
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
backlogs.

1430
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We have

1431
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
backlogs

1432
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and

1433
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm very

1434
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
proud that

1435
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
the

1436
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
whole

1437
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
management

1438
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
supported

1439
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
including

1440
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
the

1441
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
stability

1442
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
year.

1443
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The

1444
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
whole

1445
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
year

1446
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
all

1447
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the

1448
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
engineering

1449
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
teams

1450
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
were

1451
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
working

1452
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
on

1453
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
stability

1454
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
projects.

1455
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
That

1456
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
means

1457
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
if

1458
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
you

1459
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
cannot

1460
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
go

1461
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
to

1462
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
a

1463
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
project,

1464
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
you

1465
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
cannot

1466
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
work

1467
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
on your

1468
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
own.

1469
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So

1470
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
that

1471
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
was

1472
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the

1473
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
first

1474
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
project

1475
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and

1476
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I

1477
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
think

1478
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
it was

1479
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
one of

1480
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
the

1481
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
most

1482
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
important

1483
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
projects

1484
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
of

1485
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the

1486
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
year,

1487
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and

1488
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I

1489
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
think

1490
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
it was

1491
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
one of

1492
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the

1493
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
most

1494
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
important

1495
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
projects

1496
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
of the

1497
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
year.

1498
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So

1499
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
that was

1500
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
the

1501
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
first

1502
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
project

1503
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and

1504
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I

1505
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
think

1506
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
it was

1507
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
one of

1508
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
the most

1509
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
important

1510
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
projects

1511
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
of the

1512
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
year.

1513
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So

1514
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
that was

1515
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
the

1516
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
first

1517
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
project

1518
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
and

1519
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I

1520
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
think

1521
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
it was

1522
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
one of

1523
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
the most

1524
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
important

1525
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
projects

1526
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
of the

1527
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
year.

1528
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So

1529
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
that was

1530
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
the

1531
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
first

1532
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
project

1533
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and

1534
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I

1535
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
think

1536
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
it was

1537
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
one of

1538
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the most

1539
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
important

1540
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
projects

1541
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
of the

1542
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
year.

1543
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So

1544
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that was

1545
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
the

1546
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
first

1547
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
project

1548
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and

1549
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I

1550
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
think

1551
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
it was

1552
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
one of

1553
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
the most

1554
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
important

1556
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
of the

1557
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
year.

1558
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So

1559
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
that was

1560
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the

1561
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
first

1562
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
project

1563
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and

1564
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I

1565
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
think

1566
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
it was

1567
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
one of

1568
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
the most

1569
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
important

1570
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000

1571
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
of the

1572
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
year.

1573
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So

1574
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
that was

1575
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
one of

1576
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
the most

1577
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
important

1578
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
projects

1579
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
of the

1580
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
year.

1581
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So

1582
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
that was

1583
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the first

1584
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
project

1585
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and

1586
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I

1587
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
think

1588
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
it was

1589
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
one of

1590
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
the most

1591
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
important

1592
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
projects

1593
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
of the

1594
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
year.

1595
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So

1596
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
that was

1597
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the first

1598
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
project

1599
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
and

1600
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I

1601
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
think

1602
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
it was

1603
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
one of

1604
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
the

1605
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
most

1606
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000

1609
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
year.

1610
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So

1611
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
that

1612
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
was

1613
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
the second

1614
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
project

1615
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and

1616
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I

1617
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
think

1618
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that

1619
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
was

1620
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
the

1621
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
most

1622
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
important

1624
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
of the

1625
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
year.

1626
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So

1627
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
that

1628
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
was

1629
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
the

1630
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
second

1631
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
project

1632
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and

1633
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I

1634
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
think

1635
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
that

1636
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
was

1637
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
the

1638
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
most

1639
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
important

1640
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
project

1641
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
of the

1642
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
year.

1643
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So

1644
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
that

1645
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
was

1646
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
the

1647
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
second

1648
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
project

1649
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
of the

1650
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
year.

1651
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So

1652
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
that

1653
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
was

1654
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
the

1655
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
second

1656
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
project

1657
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
of the

1658
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
year.

1659
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So

1660
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
that was

1661
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
the

1662
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
second

1663
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
project

1664
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
of the

1665
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
year.

1666
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They need to know that it's not just hype, cutting-edge technology and that there is still something behind it.

1667
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It's also a learning experience for them.

1668
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's a moment for them, and it's a moment for both of them.

1669
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Together with this event, they have a better start.

1670
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That's how I see it.

1671
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Okay, now I'm done with the cards.

1672
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Now, if you want to say something to the audience, this is the moment.

1673
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yes, I would say, be worthy of your name and profession,

1674
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
work with your father and come to his podcast.

1675
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Thank you very much.

1676
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Thank you, Mateja, once again for your time and good luck with the launch of this technological park.

1677
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I would like to give the audience some feedback so that we can further improve this format and podcast.

1678
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Thank you.

1679
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Thank you.
