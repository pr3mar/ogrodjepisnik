00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome to the podcast of Grodje, this is the 5th episode, today you are with me Jure Čohaljev and Brodur, I am Oto Brgles.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today we don't have any specific agenda, but Jure will try to ask us how we see the future without traditional setups and how we will develop the software in the future.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Great, let's start.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oto is a long-time remote worker, Andraž, I assume, I know that he already works from the office, recently he is also working remotely, sometimes at home, sometimes at his office.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, in the light of the debate about working 4 days a week, there was an interesting part of the IT firm that said, let's work remotely, but in return we will hire a 4-day worker.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And now the question is, are you ready to replace your remote work with a 4-day worker under the condition that you work 4 days a week, and that there is financial compensation and a reasonable salary.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But you still pay 5 days.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You pay 5 days, but you can't work remotely, you can work 4 days a week.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you work remotely?

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I work a lot at home, but I still use our co-working space.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's hard for me to sell my local businesses and their challenges. I mean, let's say that I will move to a company in London or Berlin, and I will live in Berlin and work 4 days a week.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's hard for me to sell that.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, you are remote as a child, and remote as an adult.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I think that it's enough for me to choose how much I want to be a writer, under the conditions that suit my team, that suit my co-workers, and with some compromise.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I wouldn't say, you have to be a writer 4 days a week.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know. I think you have to survive there.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you want to work remotely, I don't know.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I also work 5 days a week, and I also work in my co-working space.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think that working in a co-working space is very difficult.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You have to solve architectural and strategic problems, and you have to sync with people.

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you need focus as an executor, to be able to code something, then the question is again, does it really have an advantage, and can it be a writer?

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you are a classic developer, maybe a little less, but if you are an engineering enablement, devops, and so on, I don't know.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I just can't imagine that I would be taught something about things, because it's hard to do some of those things.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It depends a lot on the culture.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I've been thinking a lot about the fact that people have handball in their desks.

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If I'm always a person who doesn't play handball, but has less technical, longer, and better architecture,

27
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
then it's like I play a lot of handball, and then you do the tickets faster.

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's always weird for me.

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If I'm not in the office, then I do what I do.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I see it a little differently.

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why would you have a 4-hour worker?

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why would you have a worker like that?

33
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I understand that you have some points where you have to sync with people, where you have to do something together,

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
but why would you hire people all the time?

35
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If you have people who do extra things at midnight or 11 p.m.,

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
why would you hire such a creative and capable person to go to work in the morning?

37
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I understand that you want to see what he does as a manager, as a leader,

38
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and that you want some kind of collaboration.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I get that.

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But if people are better performed than they are at work, then we have to listen to them.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How do you meet some expectations?

42
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A company doesn't run out of tickets,

43
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
a business wants more, a sales team sold out, a fiction.

44
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you can't say, hey, you've done so much in 8 hours,

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
go home and stay in the office.

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think that a big trick today is what you measure exactly.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you measure the time that people will spend on a ticket,

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
or do you measure their output?

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you measure how capable they are to deliver value,

50
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
how capable they are to deliver a product?

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If you start to focus on the results, not on how you will perform today,

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
then it becomes a trivial question.

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You don't need to measure time, if you know that some things will be done,

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
if you know that some things will be done in certain hours.

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think that these are fundamental questions and shifts that happen

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if you look at the remote first environment and culture.

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The question is, if you go 4 days a week,

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
how will they evaluate your time during that time,

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
what is the output?

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If I ask my brother how much time will be spent on an upgrade,

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
will he give me an estimate that is relatively negligible,

62
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
will he do it in a quality way,

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
will he do it with all his abilities,

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
will I be able to do it with another stakeholder,

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
will I be able to do it, because that is the most I can wish for.

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't need my brother to be an expert in his field,

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to constantly look at every micro-decision that he makes.

68
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But we'll see.

69
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
For me it is very interesting,

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
because it is one thing.

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Just before the comparison with the annual budget,

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
for me it is the 5th day.

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am happy to work 5 days a week,

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
but if someone tells me that on the 5th day

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't need to work on an ultra-product-focused feature,

76
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but I can start thinking about other things,

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
then I start working on it,

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
because you can start thinking about other things

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
in a couple of years, if you don't work on it.

80
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So I am happy to work 4 more hours,

81
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and the 5th day is for free, if that makes sense.

82
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then the fact that you have these stakeholders,

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
this is a contract between the whole population,

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that people have a common time,

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and I think that our industry is growing,

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
we have been thinking a lot about workflow for a long time,

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
very boutique,

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
because we are these artists in these super boutique cake shops,

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
where we make these beautiful cakes,

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and our industry is growing so much,

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that we will need a couple of industrial companies.

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Maybe everyone doesn't agree with that,

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
but I think that is what it is.

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't have the same routine,

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that I have with other artists.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I haven't had any Slovenian holidays,

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have had holidays from customers,

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and business partners,

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and now I am doing the opposite,

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I am having Slovenian holidays,

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
because I have studied,

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
that if I optimize for customers,

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
then they are free,

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and in Slovenia I don't have anything like that,

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and vice versa,

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
because everyone is free,

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and I am not free,

108
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I am so busy.

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I look at these things like that.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So four days working week,

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then you have a rest day,

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I know, it is tricky,

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
very tricky,

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but I am learning.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That is the problem,

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
when you work in software engineering,

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
or in development,

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
where you have this balance,

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
to do something good,

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and to do something perfect.

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Not to be good enough,

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and not to be perfect,

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
but to be able to do something,

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
because I have so many experiences,

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I am not playing handball a lot,

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I would be happy to work five more days,

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that is not such a problem.

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It depends on what these four days mean,

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
if someone says,

130
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can work five more days,

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
then I can work five more days.

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is there a factor,

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
where in the world is a schedule,

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
if in America, Asia, or England,

135
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
do you evaluate this factor?

136
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is very important to me,

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that there is a schedule,

138
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
plus two hours of my time zone,

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
when you have meetings,

140
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
if you work with someone,

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
who is not in your schedule,

142
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
then you have the most meetings,

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I have a very good performance in meetings,

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
so it is very important to me,

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that we are in the same time zones.

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The only exception would be,

147
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
if the company was so remote first,

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that a large part of the population of engineers,

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
was scattered in time zones,

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
because then the culture adheres,

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
but if there is a base,

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
then only a third of the people are somewhere else,

153
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and then through my experience,

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you start to get to know the expectations of the market.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know how it is for you,

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
but I try to avoid that,

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I used to work a lot in the USA,

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
there I had all the meetings,

159
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
all the collaborations,

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
mostly in the afternoon,

161
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and in the evening.

162
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What was a challenge for me at that time,

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
because the company was based,

164
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and because my routine was in the morning,

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I had to work until the evening,

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and I had to work all day,

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
so I started in the morning,

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
in a traditional routine,

169
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
because your relatives go to college,

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and then to work,

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and then you work,

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and then you finish,

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and then the Americans wake up,

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and start with the collaboration,

175
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and then you feel like you are stretching all day,

176
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and that didn't happen to me,

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I had a lot of difficulties,

178
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and that was a challenge,

179
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and now, as you said,

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I work mostly for some English people,

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and there, one hour plus or minus,

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
is not a problem,

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you can still adjust,

184
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and that happened to me,

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
especially when I have children,

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and I have to take care of them,

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
so I try to use that,

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and today,

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
in my circle,

190
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Slack is a communication platform,

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
where you are present,

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
sometimes you are not present,

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and you can talk as much as you can,

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or when you are healthy,

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think that has become a modern way

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
to work with remote companies,

197
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
so that you are always on the other side,

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
if you ping someone,

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that they are not calculative,

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and vice versa,

201
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so we tried to set up regular meetings,

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
where they are scheduled,

203
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and you are expected to be there,

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and the rest is how it is organized.

205
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I tried to organize it in a way

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
that you have an overlap,

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
with whom you have to have contact,

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and then there are handovers,

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and so on, if you have a daily monitoring,

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
what do you prefer?

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can quote,

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
as much as you want.

213
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You are now in a time of new remote engagement.

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I have been working with different American partners

215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
of my company for 10 years,

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and I really like it,

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I like the fact that

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I have a lot of freedom,

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
if I want to work, I work,

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
if I want to go for a walk,

221
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I go for a walk,

222
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I cut my hair.

223
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Onboarding to such a company

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
is a lot of pressure,

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
because you have a lot of meetings,

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
a lot of meetings,

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and my experience is that

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
if the company has a good leadership,

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
leadership and culture,

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
it is a good starting point,

231
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
even if you have a 6-hour meeting,

232
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
it is not like having a 6-hour meeting in football,

233
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
sometimes it is not,

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and you change social things

235
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
either in the 7th or in the 4th.

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Another thing I saw with the Americans

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
is that they fully understand

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
that the topic is about you,

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that it is about you in the evening.

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know why,

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
but they predict that if you say

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that it is about you in the evening,

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
they hear that it is about you at 10 am

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and that you are already there by 7 am.

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I have never had a problem with that.

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The bigger the company is,

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
the more communication it needs

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and the things move more slowly.

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I have worked with very small teams

250
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
where you can do everything at one meeting,

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to bigger teams where you can write a document

252
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and then people watch it every week

253
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and write comments,

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and this synchronicity and rhythm

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
removes a lot of these problems

256
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
of evening communication from our perspective.

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I am a software engineer,

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
so I deal with products,

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I am not like Brodl

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
where things burn and click.

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
For me to click,

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I have to fix some things.

263
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I have had these situations,

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
but I have also had them in Slovenia.

265
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What I have learned is that

266
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
if I put things in a new way,

267
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
if I work with smaller computers

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and more personal capacities,

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I will be able to better define those SLIs.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How often can the front page not be accessible?

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Who is being called? How do I go to the office?

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What happens if there are holidays?

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What happens if I am somewhere else?

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I will give you a tip.

275
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you have Slack installed on your phone?

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And email?

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Do you use it in your spare time?

278
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

279
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If you get a ping from the page

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
at 8pm, you will reply, right?

281
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
A message will come to you on Slack.

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Will you engage on Slack?

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
When you wake up in the morning,

284
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
you probably turn on social media.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The world wakes up overnight.

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I have the same feeling.

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I wake up in the morning,

288
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
turn on Slack and look at what GigaTron recorded

289
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
at 2am and wrote some random things.

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
These are my messages

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that I wrote on Slack in the middle of the night.

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you do this when you want to

293
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
or when you get notifications?

294
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you have notifications installed?

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Only if it is a direct message.

296
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If it is a private message.

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Working hours are installed

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and notifications.

299
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The whole phone will be in disturb mode

300
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
until 7am.

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It doesn't bother me.

302
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I prefer to be idle on the phone.

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You have a more important job than me.

304
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It is a very interesting question

305
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
because it depends on the messenger.

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't work most of the time

307
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and I don't know

308
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
if I could work more.

309
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The messenger has very fixed

310
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
business hours.

311
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It is financial.

312
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
When there is a market,

313
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
there is a market.

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't work much.

315
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't have availability.

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It depends.

317
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I agree that managing of expectations

318
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
is very important.

319
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't have a classic role

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that would be on call

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
or consulting.

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If I have a question,

323
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I will answer it.

324
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I could do something,

325
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
but I am lazy.

326
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Or I read something out of my head.

327
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The main problem

328
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
that I had with this job

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
is that we all want

330
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
to work.

331
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Everything is necessary.

332
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, everything is necessary.

333
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I have a different approach

334
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
when I try to explain

335
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to people that

336
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
if it is a small business

337
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
like a platform engineer,

338
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
you explain to people

339
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that you are alone

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and that you are very busy.

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You can't have a warm production

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
if you are fully automated.

343
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I would go to the cinema on Friday

344
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to drink a beer and eat cookies.

345
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It is very difficult for me

346
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
to help in the cinema.

347
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This is a small probability.

348
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This is a solution to the problem.

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You look at the switch

350
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and say that we need manpower

351
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and an organization

352
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
like a professional team.

353
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If I work for a startup,

354
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
one of the strategies is

355
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
to have more platform engineers

356
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in all time zones.

357
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
A lot of people

358
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
fall into the business hours.

359
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They cover a spectrum

360
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and get a lot of time.

361
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Now that I work

362
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
for a more serious side,

363
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
things are more defined.

364
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There is a culture

365
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
in smaller companies.

366
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You set yourself expectations

367
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
for a short time.

368
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
There is one interesting thing

369
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
about the image and culture.

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When you work

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
in a small team,

372
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
typical people read

373
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
in front of the world of work.

374
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
These organizations

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
are more open

376
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to all channels.

377
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You can tell

378
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
that people are talking.

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But when you walk

380
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
through the office

381
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
and go to a meeting,

382
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
it doesn't mean

383
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
that you can program

384
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
a meeting.

385
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It means that when you are

386
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
on a follow-up channel,

387
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
people should ask

388
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
about the process.

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If the product and sales

390
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
talk to each other,

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
it is your place

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
to tell them

393
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
about the process.

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We can say that

395
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
there is a culture

396
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
in these topics.

397
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
One of the things

398
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
is that people

399
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
don't write things

400
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
that are discussed

401
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
in a coffee or a beer.

402
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It is hard to understand

403
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
what is going on

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
in a company,

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
what is the vibe in a company.

406
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It is hard to understand

407
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
these things

408
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
from the communication channels.

409
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
If you are in a management position,

410
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
you should know that

411
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
there are pros and cons.

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I think that is a big flaw.

413
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
what is important and what is not, and if something is written or not.

414
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think it is important that one part of the management works properly from another place.

415
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So if your sales manager or your technical director is in another place,

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
then remote work and culture will come from above and down.

417
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What happened to us, for example, when the COVID-19 pandemic happened,

418
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
we went to remote work, because not everyone could do remote work in Denmark.

419
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Then a product manager came to me and said,

420
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I admire you guys, that in Denmark you work with such information,

421
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and it's easy for you to be acknowledged, that they give too little information from themselves.

422
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
When you put yourself in this position, what do people really need to be able to work?

423
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Where is the lack of information? What do I have to tell them? What do I have to prepare?

424
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
How much must they have in view of business decisions, so that we can react to them?

425
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Because then people also have a different approach to solving problems, a priority one.

426
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I think, as I said a few hours ago, it's a bit like you go to a walker,

427
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
you go past the NSA office and you listen to MDF.

428
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I mean, you listen to the NSA, you have to react to everything.

429
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But one thing that I do in front of everyone,

430
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:45,000
is that I try to over-communicate on these async things.

431
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't think that I write a lot on private forums,

432
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I send hundreds of messages and then I trigger them.

433
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But on these public channels, I do my best.

434
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't just write one sentence at a time,

435
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
then I add some white space, then I add some details.

436
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I think that people really appreciate that.

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
For me, it's more of a specific thing, but I don't know.

438
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
If I have a holding window where I can say,

439
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
in five minutes it will start, now it will start, now it will close.

440
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Then everything is written there.

441
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's written there when it will start and end.

442
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
These are just some small gestures that help a lot,

443
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
then people just ignore what you need.

444
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In the past, I used to write like this,

445
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
when I would write a message to a colleague,

446
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
three sentences and then I would send it.

447
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Now, when I send it, I write three sentences,

448
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
or one sentence, and then I add more details,

449
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
so that people don't get lost in the communication.

450
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
If I'm debating with some VIP,

451
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
or with this person, or this position,

452
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
these are people who are really busy.

453
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
These are people who don't have time to catch up

454
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
on asynchronous things.

455
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Then you get a feeling of how people consume information.

456
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I think that's a very important part of the job.

457
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Just to stop and think about how you're going to communicate.

458
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I often joke that when we go out to eat together,

459
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
you can look at a state machine,

460
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and you can tell it exactly what to order in three sentences.

461
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You can order with it for 15 minutes,

462
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
but because you don't understand,

463
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I would buy pork, or I would buy bacon,

464
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
or I would buy a hamburger with pork.

465
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If you order Coca-Cola Zero,

466
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
or a specific hamburger and one coffee,

467
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
the state machine will come and fix the situation.

468
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Then you ask, if you have a lot of time before the restoration,

469
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it's not that important,

470
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
but when you communicate day-to-day,

471
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
you ask yourself what is the best way to get your point across,

472
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
so that people don't have too much work to do.

473
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Will you do it?

474
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I have a question here,

475
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and I'm going to take this hack.

476
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
What I'm going to do is,

477
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm going to write two sentences,

478
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and then I'm going to write details and thread,

479
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and then you're going to get an emoji from the thread.

480
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And then people, just like an email thread,

481
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
they're going to self-select.

482
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Which is crazy,

483
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
because it gives you a written record,

484
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
according to your image,

485
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
that in a year, when someone searches,

486
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
they're going to find that sentence,

487
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
or in time,

488
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and then people are going to troubleshoot,

489
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and then we're going to thread.

490
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That's the first thing.

491
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The second thing,

492
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and I'm interested in your opinion,

493
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
about how some RFC,

494
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
how some architectural changes

495
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
are happening in such an environment.

496
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
My experience is,

497
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that if I write a document,

498
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and I don't have it on one channel,

499
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
people are going to ignore it,

500
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
but they're going to allow me to make those changes.

501
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know if they're going to ignore it.

502
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Why do you make changes,

503
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and then later that document appears,

504
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and then it's a battle?

505
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And now, how do you opt-in,

506
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
how do you get people to select it?

507
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What I mean by that,

508
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
is that,

509
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
we at RFC,

510
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
we said that,

511
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
everything is possible.

512
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
A document is written,

513
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and then there's a product,

514
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and then there's a requirement

515
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and then every feature,

516
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
that the team is going to work on,

517
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
has to have its own document.

518
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
There has to be some paperwork,

519
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and the scope of that document

520
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
is specified exactly,

521
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
what needs to be done.

522
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
From high-level overview,

523
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
to security aspect,

524
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
to data integrity,

525
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
to privacy,

526
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
everything has to be done

527
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
according to a template,

528
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
which we made with Lidia and my management,

529
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and then,

530
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
the task of the architect,

531
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
or the manager,

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
is to prepare the draft,

533
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
so that the document is written,

534
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and then,

535
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the basic core,

536
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
business aspect,

537
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
is written together with the product.

538
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That means,

539
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
that practically,

540
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
we all talk about the same expectations,

541
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
the same results.

542
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Then,

543
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
there's a smaller group of people,

544
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that takes it over,

545
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and then writes,

546
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
this will be the API,

547
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
this will be the implementation detail

548
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
on the back-end,

549
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
this will be the implementation detail

550
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
on the front-end,

551
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and then,

552
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
the smaller group of people,

553
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
technically,

554
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
takes over the task.

555
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Then,

556
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
it's presented,

557
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and then,

558
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
there's a time estimation,

559
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
which you have to give to the product management,

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and that's,

561
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
basically,

562
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
all the actors,

563
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
from the product, business, design,

564
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
to the technical implementers,

565
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
are aware of this document,

566
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and know what's going on,

567
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
what's going on in the implementation.

568
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Then,

569
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
you try to link

570
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the previous part,

571
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
the previous feature,

572
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and then create some novelties,

573
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that will be referenced,

574
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
so that you have a cluster,

575
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that you work on,

576
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
grouped.

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
In my opinion,

578
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
it's like that,

579
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
but we came to the point,

580
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
that we explicitly demand,

581
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
that these documents must be written.

582
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
The whole document is then classified,

583
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
goes to the OPEX, CAPEX,

584
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
it's some kind of operational expense,

585
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
or something that will be added by the company,

586
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and everything must be

587
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
related to this document.

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
If you go to the engineer,

589
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
to do something that doesn't have a paper,

590
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
you're basically on your own.

591
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Of course,

592
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
there's some

593
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
amount of work,

594
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
that you do,

595
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
but in the beginning,

596
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
this work could also be linked.

597
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I would also say,

598
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
if you want to have feedback,

599
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
you want to have feedback

600
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
from relevant people,

601
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
you want to have

602
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
deep enough feedback,

603
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and you never go to the office,

604
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
if you ask relevant people,

605
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
do you have feedback,

606
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
did you change this,

607
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
what do you think about the details,

608
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
or in some way,

609
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
you call people,

610
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
to give you,

611
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
so that they change it,

612
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
or in some way,

613
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
you give them a response,

614
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and then you also

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
agree with what I wrote in the document,

616
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and then it becomes a response,

617
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
in some way.

618
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Now, if I write a document,

619
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and I just hang it up,

620
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
no one will change it.

621
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
How can you try,

622
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
if people take it,

623
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
to write a bad e-mail,

624
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
or write a comment,

625
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
or write an e-mail,

626
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and no one will change it.

627
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't know.

628
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You are even better at it,

629
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
you know how to write a document,

630
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
you are a miracle.

631
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Thank you.

632
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I,

633
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
writing a document,

634
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
or reading a text,

635
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I never understood,

636
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
why in high school,

637
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
when I was a kid,

638
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I read a book,

639
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and when I got older,

640
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
in engineering,

641
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I understood better,

642
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
why I was doing it.

643
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The point is,

644
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
that in your brain,

645
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
there is an arithmetic unit,

646
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and an accumulator,

647
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and when you think about

648
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
very difficult engineering problems,

649
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and maybe you are just at work,

650
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and you work overtime,

651
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
your brain has a problem,

652
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
because you are always

653
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
on the go,

654
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
maybe you are doing

655
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Instagram scrolling,

656
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and it is very difficult

657
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
to create a state in your brain,

658
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and I like to use paper,

659
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
or whatever,

660
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
markdown file,

661
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
or confluence page,

662
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
or whatever,

663
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
as a tool,

664
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
to write better,

665
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
with a more coherent strategy,

666
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
regarding a problem,

667
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
or whatever,

668
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
or a philosophical thinking,

669
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I know it is a high level style,

670
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
but it really helps me,

671
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to organize my thoughts,

672
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
so I can write.

673
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That is the first point.

674
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
When you work at home,

675
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
if I have time,

676
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I have a lot of work,

677
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I have to jump to a lot of people,

678
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
who have a legacy,

679
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
or whatever,

680
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and they are not like,

681
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
this is a new feature,

682
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
it is 6 years in production,

683
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and now it does not work,

684
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I need 7 more employees,

685
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
who will help you solve it.

686
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And if I know,

687
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that I will talk to a lot of people,

688
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
then I make a document,

689
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I write things,

690
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and by reference,

691
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I copy it forward,

692
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and I give it to people,

693
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
before the meeting.

694
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
One thing I have learned,

695
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
is to always have a better document,

696
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
so no one can copy it,

697
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
because sometimes it happens,

698
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
that I write a document,

699
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and I give it before the meeting,

700
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
so no one can copy it,

701
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and then I write in an invite,

702
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
for a short meeting,

703
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
hey, we just went through this document,

704
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and then I open it on share,

705
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and I share points.

706
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It depends on the culture,

707
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
some people will tell you,

708
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
hey, we just went through this,

709
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
it does not matter,

710
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
some people will say,

711
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
thank you, because you gave me time,

712
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and I will look at it.

713
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
People I work with,

714
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
they have 9 hours,

715
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and they have 15 minutes,

716
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and you have to give them time,

717
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
so they will take time for it.

718
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That is one thing,

719
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and the other thing,

720
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
that I have learned,

721
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
it depends on the site,

722
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
for example,

723
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
it is good to say,

724
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
ok, we will write a RFC,

725
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
with a new feature,

726
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
but when we work with SAS,

727
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
we will think about the architecture,

728
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and do it,

729
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
and then I say, cool,

730
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and then think,

731
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
you are not SAS,

732
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and you have Omprem,

733
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and you have hundreds of sites,

734
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and you have to find a way

735
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
to deploy the product,

736
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and you do not have 5 documents,

737
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
with different versions,

738
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
where you can,

739
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I like to make tricks,

740
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
it is so hard to understand,

741
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
how to work with a specific product,

742
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
if we say,

743
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Deutsche Bank has this version,

744
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
you can take a document,

745
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and if you are a startup,

746
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and you will make an MVP,

747
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and you are looking for a feed,

748
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and you need it,

749
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and you do not know,

750
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
if there are 3,

751
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
so it depends,

752
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
case by case,

753
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
what you want to document,

754
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and it is important,

755
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
that things are crisp,

756
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and that,

757
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I like to choose a user manual,

758
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and nobody chooses it,

759
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I see people opening a box,

760
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and throwing it aside,

761
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and you as an engineer,

762
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
you have to choose a user manual,

763
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and when you are a person,

764
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
who will be able to communicate,

765
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
with normal people,

766
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
with their brilliance,

767
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
it is a big challenge,

768
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and people can choose more codes,

769
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
than open source,

770
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and more user manuals,

771
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
so when you open a product,

772
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and you take it in English,

773
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
ok, safety instructions,

774
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
copy and paste,

775
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but choose a little,

776
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and at some point,

777
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
if you are a software engineer,

778
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
it will happen to you,

779
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that someone will tell you,

780
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
that you need to write an instruction,

781
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
for a software engineer,

782
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
or for an end user manual.

783
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I would choose two more,

784
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
very good experiences,

785
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
you told me two things,

786
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
very good,

787
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
one of the best things,

788
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
that I found on Mac,

789
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
is that I bought OmniGraph,

790
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
for Microsoft Visio,

791
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and it still exists,

792
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
there is also Draw.io,

793
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
which is a tool,

794
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
for drawing sketches,

795
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I use Desktop,

796
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
but when you have,

797
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
a remote team,

798
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
it is like a tool,

799
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
for quick sketching,

800
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
or to quickly present,

801
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
an idea,

802
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it is much more effective,

803
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
than a book,

804
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
or a manual,

805
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
so OmniGraph,

806
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and this system,

807
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
for archiving,

808
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
all the technical sketches,

809
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I found very useful,

810
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and now I have a large database,

811
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
of all the sketches,

812
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and when I onboard some people,

813
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I know exactly,

814
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
where the sketches are,

815
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I show them,

816
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and it is much easier,

817
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
to communicate,

818
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and I try to resonate,

819
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
some of the sketches,

820
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
so I have an overview,

821
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
of what happened,

822
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
it turned out,

823
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to be very useful,

824
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
for conveying information,

825
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
today I also learned,

826
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
how to use this tool,

827
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
so I can quickly sketch,

828
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
if we have an online session,

829
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and transfer those things,

830
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
the second tool,

831
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
is KosoCity,

832
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
with KosoCity,

833
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
we try to make,

834
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
demos,

835
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and it is a session,

836
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
where developers,

837
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
engineers, designers,

838
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
sales people,

839
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
constantly show their results,

840
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and I try,

841
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
to record,

842
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
all those product features,

843
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and then I have,

844
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
on YouTube,

845
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
an archive,

846
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
of the product,

847
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
demo,

848
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and KosoCity,

849
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and when someone comes,

850
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and asks,

851
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
why did you do this,

852
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
we had this idea,

853
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and this video,

854
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
is still archived,

855
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I won't say,

856
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it is like a meeting,

857
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
but this is how,

858
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the product looked,

859
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
this time,

860
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and today,

861
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
as you can see,

862
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I have a whole collection,

863
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
of those videos,

864
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
so one is the sketch,

865
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and then the video.

866
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
One culture,

867
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
on this forum,

868
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
is Loom,

869
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Loom.com gives you an app,

870
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and when you,

871
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
scroll up in the toolbar,

872
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
you click it,

873
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and you can record for 5 minutes,

874
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
from the screen recording,

875
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and the whole hack is,

876
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to say,

877
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I will record this Loom,

878
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and spread it on the screen.

879
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And also the sound?

880
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yes, the sound,

881
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and it gives you a circle,

882
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
your face if you want,

883
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and it tells you how many clicks,

884
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
how much progress,

885
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and then,

886
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
unlike YouTube,

887
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
where those problems are solved,

888
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
it is sold as a SaaS product,

889
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and it is nice,

890
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
because it is nice,

891
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
because you can teach people support,

892
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
so they produce a bug,

893
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and Loom records it,

894
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
QA people,

895
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and you don't get a single zoom meeting,

896
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
because people send you a 2 minute video.

897
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So this was,

898
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
a very interesting forum,

899
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
if you would like to have some previous companies,

900
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
but they didn't exist yet.

901
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Another thing I saw,

902
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
for writing documents,

903
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
it is often nice,

904
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
people have a strong opinion,

905
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
but they have to explain it,

906
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
as if I would write it.

907
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And then it is good to have a zoom session,

908
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
open a document,

909
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
on your screen,

910
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and then write bullets,

911
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
for them.

912
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And they look at it,

913
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and correct you,

914
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and you type for them.

915
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And when you conclude those main thoughts,

916
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
you are in peace,

917
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and you do editorial process,

918
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
where you make those notes,

919
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and they work on a clean paper.

920
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And then,

921
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
when you are done,

922
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
after you have written those things,

923
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
you can move on,

924
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to a phase of feedback,

925
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and execution,

926
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and you move people from the loop,

927
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
which can take a long time.

928
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yesterday,

929
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
we were talking with Jure,

930
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and he told me,

931
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
that there is a hack,

932
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
where you can write,

933
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
if you don't know,

934
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
you can write fake information,

935
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and if you are on a call,

936
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
people will be triggered,

937
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and they will correct you.

938
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I noticed that,

939
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and it is really nice,

940
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
because you engage people.

941
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So that people understand,

942
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and...

943
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Like when I was at Filofax,

944
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and I know Slovenian very well,

945
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
if I started to write something on a board,

946
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
people would run to me,

947
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and correct me.

948
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
But in the end,

949
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
you get a quality product.

950
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It is a...

951
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
How to engage with the crowd?

952
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I would go back to that,

953
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and I will talk about it later,

954
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
but have you ever been

955
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
in a collective on Slack,

956
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
where someone writes

957
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
a really funny joke,

958
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
or a meme,

959
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
or a picture,

960
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and then HR gets triggered,

961
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and Slack dies,

962
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and then...

963
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The culture of jokes

964
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
can be very different,

965
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
from team to team,

966
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
you can have

967
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
local culture,

968
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
that influences Slack,

969
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
and remote culture,

970
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and things that are very funny,

971
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
or very unproductive,

972
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
or can be just a joke.

973
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But on the other hand,

974
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
this simplicity

975
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
also dictates the culture

976
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
that you try to have,

977
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
or to have.

978
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I think,

979
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
from my perspective,

980
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
as a local participant,

981
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
if you are employed,

982
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
you are in a better position

983
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
as an employee,

984
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
than on a project.

985
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
From my perspective,

986
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
you can be very friendly

987
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
with people,

988
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and you can definitely

989
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
have more professionalism.

990
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You can be more professional,

991
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
when they are

992
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
on a good day,

993
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and you can be on your bad day.

994
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That means,

995
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
no memes,

996
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
only three smilies,

997
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and maybe one

998
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
held set smiley.

999
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Everything else,

1000
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
in my opinion,

1001
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
will be understood.

1002
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yes, I agree.

1003
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And vice versa,

1004
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
when they make another joke,

1005
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and you don't understand it.

1006
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Or culturally.

1007
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I don't know.

1008
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm much more predictable

1009
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
about these things.

1010
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Even on this podcast.

1011
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This podcast is very relaxed.

1012
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Nobody who listens to it

1013
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
from one office,

1014
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
doesn't understand the dynamics

1015
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
of this office.

1016
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
When you know it for five years,

1017
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
an insider's joke

1018
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
will be very inappropriate,

1019
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
especially for R.

1020
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You have to be very careful.

1021
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I don't know.

1022
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
About some collectives,

1023
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
where you get to know people better,

1024
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and you want to make some jokes.

1025
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Or you can change

1026
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
a communication channel,

1027
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
if you really can't help.

1028
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You can make a telegram

1029
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
with half a smiley.

1030
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Yes.

1031
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
If you really can't help.

1032
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I don't know.

1033
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
If there is less R on the topic.

1034
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But you will have a different platform.

1035
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I don't have a private channel.

1036
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
There are a lot of platforms.

1037
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I think it's a good assumption,

1038
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
that whatever you write

1039
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
in a computer,

1040
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
which is controlled

1041
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
by your phone,

1042
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
or in an app,

1043
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
which is controlled by your phone,

1044
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
it's logged forever.

1045
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Let's be hackers.

1046
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm going to write an app,

1047
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
and I'm going to be paranoid.

1048
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm going to be paranoid.

1049
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's like hacking something

1050
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
in black or grey,

1051
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
if you want to post a meme.

1052
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I don't know.

1053
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm very predictable.

1054
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It comes to some

1055
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
incomprehensible things.

1056
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I have another question.

1057
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's probably relevant,

1058
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
or not.

1059
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It's probably a podcast

1060
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
between HR managers,

1061
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
who recruit people

1062
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
from all over the world.

1063
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Do you think

1064
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
that the remote way of work,

1065
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
or the remote development way of work,

1066
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
is for everyone?

1067
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Who would be interested in the remote way of work?

1068
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Do you have to be...

1069
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
A junior.

1070
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I have less than 5 years of work experience.

1071
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Explain what you mean.

1072
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's hard

1073
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
to find some cultures

1074
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
and conversations

1075
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
if you're a junior.

1076
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I think that

1077
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
this office had a lot of experience

1078
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
through Cyber People,

1079
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
as well as through

1080
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
office work in offices.

1081
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and the discussions that took place both in the gym and in the cafe

1082
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
you can't get them if you work from home.

1083
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Which means that you might be able to accept some discords,

1084
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
you might find some slacks, but

1085
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
you don't get relevant hands-on experience and feedback

1086
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
from your managers.

1087
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So here

1088
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I haven't talked about how on-board juniors

1089
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
would be in a very remote culture.

1090
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I would agree.

1091
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And it's even more bizarre because we are now in GigaTrons.io

1092
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and we are all co-workers.

1093
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
How do you say that?

1094
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Cimri.

1095
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Cimri, yes.

1096
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And the good reason is that we are here,

1097
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
but we are not at home.

1098
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And for me, one reason is that

1099
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
we are all working on different projects,

1100
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
but for me it's very valuable to have a chitchat

1101
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
that we have in our circles.

1102
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
If I have a networking story,

1103
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I can always go to Andraž and ask him,

1104
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I don't know,

1105
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Hey, I haven't worked in a location for a long time,

1106
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
in a big network, can you help me with that?

1107
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So I know it's a bit random,

1108
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
but I also think that...

1109
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It worries me that if I worked alone at home,

1110
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
remotely,

1111
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
then my bubble would be all over the place.

1112
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Also technologically, culturally, and everything.

1113
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
If you are still in a collective with someone,

1114
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
it helps me a lot.

1115
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So I work remotely, but I don't work from home,

1116
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
because that's the bizarreness.

1117
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Yes, I agree.

1118
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I always try to look for people

1119
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
who are more experienced and independent.

1120
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I wouldn't say junior, mid, whatever,

1121
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
but independent in the sense that

1122
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
whatever the problem is,

1123
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
people will be able to formulate it,

1124
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
to ask questions,

1125
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
or to deal with it more comprehensively and broadly.

1126
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That's why you need a certain amount of experience,

1127
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
as you said, I agree.

1128
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So yes, it's hard to offer mentorship

1129
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
on remote arrangements,

1130
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
if you have to work very explicitly with it.

1131
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
But yes, especially if it's a set of challenges.

1132
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Okay.

1133
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'll miss the map.

1134
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Don't worry.

1135
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Okay, then we'll wrap up,

1136
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and I would like to thank our guests,

1137
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
our listeners, if they have any suggestions,

1138
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
comments, feedback,

1139
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
contact us,

1140
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
so we can continue with these sessions.

1141
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Brodo, Jure, thank you.

1142
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Thank you, too.

1143
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Bye.
