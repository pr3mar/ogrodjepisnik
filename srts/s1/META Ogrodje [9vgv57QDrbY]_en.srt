00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,680
Welcome to a new episode of Grodje. Today we will try a little more unscripted

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,680
again and very organically talk a little more about our podcast. We will try

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,680
to talk a little about the feedback we get, we will try to talk about the future of this podcast.

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:47,680
We will discuss the production, we will discuss how we see this part, what could go forward.

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,680
We can also talk about some of the experiences we have gained, we can talk about the mistakes we made.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Let's make a break today. Knowledge is also one dollar today.

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:10,680
I write in the comments that you are a sound wizard, but I think I could call it a multimedia wizard,

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,680
because you don't just work with sound and you are at home in the whole production industry.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,680
You also knew Andraža, Andraž Brodnik, Brodol and Andraž Sraka.

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Everyone, welcome and ...

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I hope you are quiet.

12
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,680
With this intro, I asked myself all kinds of questions.

13
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,680
It's hard to talk when there are four of us, because I can't hear a single word.

14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,680
It was hard when you said that intro. It's not scripted, but you put it that way.

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,680
A cover or a device that we don't like.

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Today there will be a lot of debate. Today there will be only debate.

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Today there will be only debate.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Unscripted, against everything else, very structured.

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,679
Turn off your notes.

20
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,679
So, maybe ...

21
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:17,679
Let's start from the beginning.

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,679
What's on your mind?

23
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:25,679
People complain that we have such good sound quality,

24
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:32,679
that when they drive on the road, they hear our alarms and sirens in the background.

25
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,679
That's a real problem.

26
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:38,679
It's almost as if I would let go of those comments.

27
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:43,679
But I really try to hear them as little as possible.

28
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:46,679
But you can't cut everything out.

29
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:52,679
Today we have a lot of people here with a hot microphone.

30
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,679
And we got ...

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,679
Jan drove from Maribor.

32
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:03,679
And he's actually right in the back, so you can hear us so well.

33
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,679
It would be really interesting ...

34
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,679
I think we could make an episode about that,

35
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:12,679
so it would be a role play for those who are interested.

36
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:15,679
I can make an interlude here,

37
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,679
and then I'll edit it.

38
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,679
I know I edited it.

39
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,679
And then I'll put it back together.

40
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:25,679
I think that's the easiest way.

41
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:30,679
So you can see how much work is needed

42
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:36,679
and you get a pretty good result that is audible.

43
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:38,679
It's really interesting to me,

44
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,679
because everyone praises the sound quality,

45
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,679
and I know that I could do a lot more

46
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,679
to hear myself a little better.

47
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,679
It's always free for everyone,

48
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:53,679
so I think it's something new we're studying.

49
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:59,679
So yeah, now we're at 60% of what you'd like.

50
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:04,679
60% of what we're doing with this setup in this environment.

51
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,679
Yes.

52
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,679
And then ...

53
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,679
Do you want to say that we can get another 40% from this microphone?

54
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,679
Yes.

55
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:15,679
We're taking a little more space here,

56
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:19,679
so it would be possible to do a lot more,

57
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:24,679
but editing would be a little more complicated.

58
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:28,679
Considering that we switched from mono to stereo,

59
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:31,679
I don't know if I can correct that.

60
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,679
But it's still known,

61
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:37,679
because the one on the left or the one on the right

62
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:41,679
can cover a lot of space.

63
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:44,679
It goes a little further than me.

64
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:49,679
If you look at professional podcasters,

65
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,679
they have 4 or 5 microphones,

66
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,679
and some networks,

67
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,679
would you dramatically improve that?

68
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,679
Would you go further?

69
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,679
Definitely, there would be less sounds

70
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,679
from the road or something like that,

71
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,679
because you have a microphone for every speaker,

72
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,679
almost in front of your mouth,

73
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,679
which doesn't pick up and practically does nothing.

74
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:16,679
But we would be able to do that.

75
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,679
You'll see how everything dies.

76
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,679
Yes, we'll see how everything dies.

77
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,679
I mean, we have the opportunity.

78
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,679
Something is still dying.

79
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,679
I mean, technically,

80
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,679
yes, a lot of different things.

81
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,679
In my opinion,

82
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,679
whatever we switch, it will be more like it is.

83
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:39,679
It's also nice that we can set it up quickly

84
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:44,679
and that you always have the easier work.

85
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:52,679
I care about the infrastructure in the information system.

86
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,679
I appreciate it when people

87
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,679
and the product of their work,

88
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,679
if it's written in a good way,

89
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,679
so that I don't have to work.

90
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,679
So that I understand your pain,

91
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:11,679
and I think I spent 10 years in CyberPip

92
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:15,679
taking care of the sound and recording on cassettes.

93
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,679
I didn't edit it,

94
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:20,679
but I heard that I worked the hardest

95
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,679
so that there were no microphones.

96
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,679
And I also understand the life of technology

97
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,679
and I know how underappreciated it is.

98
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:33,679
That's why this will be a typical journalist's question

99
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,679
where do you go to primary school?

100
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,679
No, I won't answer that.

101
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:42,679
I think you are probably the best

102
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,679
in multimedia and journalism,

103
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,679
and in the way you work.

104
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,679
I think we are all better.

105
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,679
I think Draž will probably answer that.

106
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,679
More theoretically,

107
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:02,679
I tried a lot of things in this field.

108
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,679
In every episode I try to learn something,

109
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:07,679
to be better.

110
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,679
And I realized that this microphone

111
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,679
is not as scary for our guests

112
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,679
as if I gave it to someone

113
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,679
on a t-shirt,

114
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,679
or if I told them to hold it in their hands

115
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,679
or to throw it in front of them.

116
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:27,679
Or maybe I gave them headphones.

117
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,679
Yes, like a studio.

118
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,679
And probably this is also related

119
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:37,679
to our format where we try to simplify it

120
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,679
so that the guests are simplified

121
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,679
and we also try to be organic.

122
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:48,679
Maybe it sounds a bit weaker

123
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,679
so that we don't have 60%

124
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,679
or 100% or maybe 65%

125
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:57,679
so that we have only organic guests.

126
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,679
Because it seems to me that in the beginning

127
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,679
people make mistakes in the first few minutes,

128
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,679
in the first 10 minutes,

129
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,679
then they will forgive themselves.

130
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,679
And then when you go,

131
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,679
you try to make the sound

132
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,679
between the conversations

133
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,679
so that people don't fall.

134
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,679
People will wonder what kind of microphone is this.

135
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,679
Look, now I can take a picture

136
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,679
and they will see what it looks like.

137
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,679
We will put it somewhere.

138
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,679
No, I don't think it's strong enough.

139
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,679
Let's go back first.

140
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,679
How did you find each other?

141
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,679
How did the idea come about

142
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,679
that we are now in the second or third episode

143
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,679
and that we don't have to do the production ourselves

144
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,679
and we need a person who will assist us here?

145
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,679
Let's solve that first.

146
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,679
That's a good question.

147
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,679
The part where we are together,

148
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,679
we will talk about it later.

149
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,679
We didn't know that we had

150
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,679
the same part together.

151
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,679
We recorded it.

152
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,679
In the beginning it was like a joke,

153
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,679
now I see it as a start-up

154
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,679
or as a business story.

155
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,679
When I see something working,

156
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,679
people reacting well,

157
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,679
then I evaluate it.

158
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,679
It pays off a lot of time, energy,

159
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,679
knowledge, money and so on.

160
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,679
If you do things like that,

161
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,679
you want to have a good team

162
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,679
and you want to lay a good foundation.

163
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,679
That's the point,

164
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,679
to lay a good foundation.

165
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,679
We need a good personality,

166
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,679
how we will attract people,

167
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,679
how we will discuss things.

168
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,679
These are things we need to fulfill.

169
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,679
On the other hand,

170
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,679
you want a well-equipped infrastructure,

171
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,679
well-founded foundations,

172
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,679
on which we can build.

173
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,679
If the microphone has some capabilities

174
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,679
and we don't use them to the maximum,

175
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,679
then it's not an opportunity for me.

176
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,679
Jan is in charge of sound,

177
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,679
but in the back he is also in charge

178
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,679
of multimedia and multimedia production,

179
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,679
which means that in the next phase,

180
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,679
when that phase is over,

181
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,679
when the time is right,

182
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,679
we will also go into video,

183
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,679
streaming and so on.

184
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,679
If we do that,

185
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,679
I think Jan also has a lot of experience

186
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,679
in this area.

187
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,679
You can't do it alone,

188
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,679
you have to cooperate

189
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,679
and look for people

190
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,679
you can cooperate with.

191
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,679
It's a common theme.

192
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,679
You sound like an overseller

193
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,679
from Brazil.

194
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,679
A lot of people still haven't answered

195
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,679
how you found Jan.

196
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,679
I met him in the back.

197
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,679
This podcast wouldn't have been possible

198
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,679
if I hadn't met him in the back.

199
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,679
The people I met in the back

200
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,679
are people I have cooperated with

201
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,679
before or still cooperate with,

202
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,679
similar to other projects.

203
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,679
In this case,

204
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,679
he connected me to Jarnej Gračner.

205
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,679
He is a multimedia master

206
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,679
for 15 hours in Maribor.

207
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,679
Jarnej, if you can hear me,

208
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,679
I greet you nicely.

209
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,679
He says that if I need

210
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,679
an artistic work

211
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,679
for a Slovenian developer,

212
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,679
I ask him,

213
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,679
if I need other graphic elements,

214
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,679
etc.

215
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,679
Jarnej is the one

216
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,679
I turn to.

217
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,679
He also has the best experience

218
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,679
with streaming.

219
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,679
He made me a title

220
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,679
for the podcast

221
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,679
and he contacted me.

222
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,679
That's how we came together.

223
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,679
The rest is history.

224
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,679
Then you offered him

225
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,679
a recording

226
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,679
and he said,

227
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,679
this is not it.

228
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,679
I gave him a cover

229
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,679
for 5000 euros

230
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,679
and I said,

231
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,679
let's do an episode.

232
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,679
Each episode costs

233
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,679
5000 euros minus.

234
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,679
So, if you can hear me,

235
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,679
let's make a deal.

236
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,679
That would be great.

237
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,679
I pay more as a developer.

238
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,679
That would be great.

239
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,679
No, I mean,

240
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,679
I don't think

241
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,679
we have a deal yet.

242
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,679
I mean,

243
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,679
he contacted me.

244
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,679
In the first episode,

245
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,679
we started adding

246
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,679
ideas

247
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,679
on how to

248
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,679
continue recording.

249
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,679
I think that's

250
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,679
getting better.

251
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,679
Now we have

252
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,679
optimized

253
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,679
the setup,

254
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,679
the microphone,

255
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,679
and so on.

256
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,679
But post-production,

257
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,679
when you get the recording,

258
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,679
you have a lot of work to do.

259
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,679
Yes.

260
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,679
You can write

261
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,679
what was...

262
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,679
What is it like

263
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,679
for the listeners?

264
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,679
What must be done

265
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,679
in post-production?

266
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,679
You can start

267
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,679
by yourself.

268
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,679
What to do with the sound

269
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,679
in post-production?

270
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,679
What are the possibilities?

271
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,679
What can be done?

272
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,679
What can't be fixed?

273
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,679
The main thing is the volume.

274
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,679
It has to be loud enough,

275
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,679
but it can't be too loud.

276
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,679
When you can

277
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,679
reduce the volume,

278
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,679
then everything is

279
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,679
loud.

280
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,679
You have to reduce it

281
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,679
and set the limits

282
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,679
so that it's loud enough.

283
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,679
That's how it works.

284
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,679
In addition,

285
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,679
the noise is removed.

286
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,679
It's not all

287
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,679
complicated.

288
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,679
You have to go through

289
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,679
the recording,

290
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,679
listen to it,

291
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,679
and so on.

292
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,679
You can see

293
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,679
the recorded sound.

294
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,679
You can see it in the graph

295
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,679
if someone speaks too quietly.

296
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,679
Then you can

297
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,679
raise the volume

298
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,679
or reduce it

299
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,679
if it's too loud.

300
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,679
It's usually when you laugh

301
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,679
or when someone speaks too loudly.

302
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,679
That's when the noise

303
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,679
starts and you have to

304
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,679
reduce it.

305
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,679
You can automate it,

306
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,679
but I don't do it

307
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,679
at the moment

308
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,679
because I'm listening to it

309
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,679
directly from the podcast.

310
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,679
That's

311
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,679
the most basic thing.

312
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,679
It's a suitable software.

313
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,679
How do you work with it?

314
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,679
What's the hardware

315
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,679
software that

316
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,679
makes it the easiest for you?

317
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,679
I've been

318
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,679
using the standard

319
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,679
Adobe programs

320
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,679
for a few years now.

321
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,679
When it comes to

322
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,679
DaVinci Resolve,

323
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,679
which is Blackmagic,

324
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,679
we do everything

325
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,679
with DaVinci.

326
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,679
It's a great software.

327
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,679
I can do anything with it.

328
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,679
I'm using it now.

329
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,679
Is it something

330
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,679
that you would call

331
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,679
industry standard?

332
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,679
What do most people

333
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,679
use?

334
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,679
It depends on

335
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,679
the industry.

336
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,679
If we look at

337
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,679
big media sites,

338
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,679
like RTV,

339
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,679
they definitely use

340
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,679
software that's

341
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,679
more for their industry standard.

342
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,679
What I'm using

343
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,679
is

344
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,679
from freelance

345
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,679
to

346
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,679
the beginning of Hollywood,

347
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,679
because DaVinci became

348
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,679
very strong in the film industry.

349
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,679
It started with color grading,

350
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,679
but they added

351
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,680
a lot more.

352
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
There are some

353
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
shortcomings,

354
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
but you can do

355
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
practically anything.

356
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I wouldn't say

357
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
that it's beyond

358
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
any standard.

359
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Maybe it's on a

360
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
professional level,

361
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
because

362
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
CDs,

363
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
I don't know,

364
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
it's a music production.

365
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
You don't record music.

366
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
But it's a tool that you use

367
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
not only for sound editing,

368
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
but also for video.

369
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Everything works with it.

370
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
It's primarily a video program.

371
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
I had it at the beginning

372
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
on colors,

373
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
but the whole editor

374
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
and the section

375
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
where you have

376
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
effects,

377
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
various visual effects.

378
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
It's kind of like Unreal.

379
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
At first,

380
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
it was something,

381
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
but now it's...

382
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I don't know if DaVinci

383
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
is one program,

384
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
but it's a suite of problems

385
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
that you can solve

386
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
or work on.

387
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Color grading,

388
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
pictures,

389
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
3D animation.

390
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
That's what I like

391
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
most about DaVinci.

392
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Every program is special.

393
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,680
You have Premiere for

394
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
editing,

395
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
After Effects for effects,

396
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Audition for sound.

397
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Everything is special,

398
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
and you can re-open it.

399
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
DaVinci has a section

400
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
where you put

401
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
everything from the project.

402
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
It's easier to work

403
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
with a team,

404
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
because everything is packed.

405
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
They also

406
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
developed a cloud

407
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
collab,

408
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
where you get a version

409
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
of a NAS system,

410
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
but everything is

411
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
connected.

412
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
I still have to try

413
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
that,

414
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
or get to know someone

415
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
who got it,

416
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
because everything is

417
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
automated.

418
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
You keep the main files

419
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,680
in DaVinci.

420
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Everything is generated

421
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
in proxy.

422
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Everything is done

423
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
at the same time,

424
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
on the same project.

425
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
It's not that complex.

426
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
I still don't get it.

427
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Let's talk about

428
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
audio reproduction.

429
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Files are huge.

430
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Our 2 hours

431
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
is about 2 GB.

432
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
It's just sound.

433
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Do you have any problems

434
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
with the volume?

435
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
It depends

436
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
how long the recordings are,

437
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
and the quality.

438
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
For sound,

439
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
for podcasts,

440
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
I try to keep

441
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
the best quality possible.

442
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Now we have

443
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
a 20-bit WAV file.

444
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
It's a 2 GB file,

445
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
but it's not

446
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
that big.

447
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
If I compare it

448
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
to a video,

449
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
it would probably be

450
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
more than enough.

451
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
When I record

452
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
pro-res formats,

453
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
with less compression,

454
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
these are huge files.

455
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
If I wanted

456
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
to put a camera here,

457
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
and record 2 hours

458
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
with more sound and video,

459
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
would it be 1 TB file?

460
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
No.

461
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Probably

462
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
for such a long recording

463
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
you don't need

464
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
such quality files.

465
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
You record

466
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
as much as you can

467
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
in some mp4 format.

468
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
In the end,

469
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I would definitely

470
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
record a podcast video

471
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
on my phone,

472
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
because it's enough.

473
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
For someone to record

474
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
a podcast for 2 hours,

475
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
and watch it from the side,

476
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
and then want

477
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
an extra-nice 6K picture,

478
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
I don't know.

479
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
I believe that only the sound

480
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
plays here.

481
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
The better the sound,

482
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,680
the better the quality.

483
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I have a question.

484
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Can you record 1 hour

485
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
of video on your phone?

486
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
It's not about the power.

487
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
The question is,

488
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
I can check that.

489
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
I've seen so much

490
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
in other video games,

491
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
that I don't know about the phone.

492
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
It's probably more

493
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,680
about the app.

494
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
If it was a basic app,

495
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
like mine,

496
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
DSLRs and mirrorless cameras

497
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
are limited to half an hour.

498
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
If you would record

499
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
longer than half an hour,

500
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
there wouldn't be more cameras.

501
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
There's also

502
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
trade agreements.

503
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
All of them are limited

504
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
to 29 minutes.

505
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
It's a bad video.

506
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
You can record it,

507
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
but you have more power.

508
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Speaking of sound quality,

509
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
we're recording in stereo.

510
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
The recorder has two microphones,

511
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
so we're recording in stereo.

512
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
You mentioned the noise.

513
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
What does it have to do

514
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
with the stereo?

515
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Can you

516
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,680
check the noise

517
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
with the two microphones?

518
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
It's not a glitch.

519
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
I made the left and right channels

520
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
smaller.

521
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
We're in the middle,

522
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
and both microphones

523
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
are relatively the same.

524
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Andraža and Ota

525
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
are on their own side.

526
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
If one of them speaks,

527
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
the other channel basically

528
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
does the talking.

529
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
In the beginning,

530
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I make both channels

531
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
as my own mono recordings.

532
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
So, the noise

533
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
on these two channels

534
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
is drastically reduced

535
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
and the environment

536
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
and the sound.

537
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
That's the first step

538
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
we took

539
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
with the stereo.

540
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Everything is known.

541
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll ask Andraža.

542
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
When you said

543
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
you chose the recorder,

544
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
we were in Maribor

545
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
and he asked me to bring

546
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
the recorder to look at it.

547
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
And I said,

548
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
we have this,

549
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
what can we do with it?

550
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
You know,

551
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
when you see a person

552
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
who is really into his industry,

553
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
when he holds it in his hand,

554
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
it's like click, click, click.

555
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
It's a completely different setting.

556
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
We do it differently.

557
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
When someone says,

558
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
oh, you have a recorder,

559
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
I look at it and say,

560
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
no, don't touch it.

561
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
That was just because

562
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
you didn't want to bring it.

563
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
No, it was because

564
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
it took so long.

565
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
You know what else I learned?

566
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
People won't know,

567
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
but there was an episode

568
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
where I thought

569
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
I had recorded it for an hour

570
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
and then I realized

571
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
it had been recorded for 10 minutes.

572
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
And then I apologized to the guest.

573
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,400
We didn't film for 40 minutes, I'm an amateur and I don't know how to continue, and it took up a lot of space for us.

574
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:15,400
So, if you can do something wrong in the roster, fix it, and then try again, it's practically a waste of time to try again.

575
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,600
The guest says it for an hour, then he goes back, and then once again, the whole debate, me and you, it's fucked up.

576
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,799
If I remember correctly, the guest said that he would say it even better.

577
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, he said it even better. On the other hand, we had a hard time, because we didn't know if we had already discussed certain things,

578
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
or not, and it was already a bit... It was especially hard.

579
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:43,200
The main thing is, when you work on a production, you can edit some things, you can clean some things,

580
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:54,400
but when it comes to personality, you can't fix mistakes, and that's why it's good to have someone who knows the industry.

581
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,000
And Brian Vodilte doesn't make automatic mistakes.

582
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No, no, no. He just starts something. On the other hand, Brian Vodilte tells you how you should look at it,

583
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,400
how much space you still have, and what you should fix.

584
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,199
That's true.

585
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,599
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:17,599
But, a bit on his side, I don't know. When it comes to formats and similar things, it's not in Vodilte.

587
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,199
I mean, he shows you how to fix it, but...

588
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,199
Oh, I made a mistake there.

589
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,400
I think, in the end, it's important, if you're doing a podcast, to do it in stereo,

591
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,400
and if I don't have any problems with the production, which we didn't have, in the end, it was all the same to us.

592
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,800
Then, how to do a trade-off between the important resolution and the frequency of the sound.

593
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,400
What do I know? I know, as an electrician, when they told me,

594
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,599
Hey, you have a TV signal here, send it to me.

595
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,599
As someone who listens to it, or someone who studies it professionally, what is it now,

596
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:57,599
do we need to have a very high frequency, or more beats?

597
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,599
You never know.

598
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,599
Yeah, I mean, both for the video, and for the sound, and for everything.

599
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,599
In fact, the more quality the file you record,

600
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:13,600
the more quality it is, the more friendly the format is, the bigger the files are,

601
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,800
but they are so big, because you need so much information,

602
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,800
with which you can work in post-production.

603
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
So, that's just a trade-off.

604
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Because, for example, those first recordings, I think they were shot in MP4,

605
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,800
for example, there, the noise, it was hard to erase the noise.

606
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Because there is no program, there is no data, there is no beat.

607
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So, wow, the format is raw, not lost, right?

608
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Well, no, I wouldn't say it's raw.

609
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So, 24 beats, we record...

610
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Stereo.

611
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Stereo, and how many frequencies do we have?

612
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
48,000.

613
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
48,000, OK. So, I can't have a very high 5.

614
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I mean, you can try, and then...

615
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:07,199
But you won't hear it.

616
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,199
But wouldn't it have the same standard as a CD?

617
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,199
No.

618
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:13,199
CD has half.

619
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,199
Phew, now you got me.

620
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,199
Beats have less.

621
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,199
Yeah, beats have less.

622
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,199
The other one has...

623
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:25,199
I mean, 48 kHz, but how much is on a dance floor, then...

624
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:28,199
CD quality is definitely compressed.

625
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,399
When you ask like that, if an album on a CD is 45 minutes,

626
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,399
then it goes to 700 megabytes,

627
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:38,399
and we wait for an hour, it goes to 2 gigabytes.

628
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,399
I mean, really, it's...

629
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,399
Right?

630
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,399
So...

631
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,399
If you...

632
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:49,399
Yeah, you could look at how fast the dance floor is,

633
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:52,399
and you would hear it quickly.

634
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,399
With videos, I'm more consistent with those numbers,

635
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,399
than with audio.

636
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I have a very basic question.

637
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Like, okay,

638
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
at first, you didn't do it like that,

639
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,600
for a videographer, and everyone taught you that,

640
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
but where did you learn all that stuff?

641
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
That's a very good question.

642
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
That's an error?

643
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Yeah, I would say so.

644
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I've always been a geek with some technology,

645
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
whatever it was.

646
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,799
I've been with computers for many years,

647
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,799
and then I just kept doing it.

648
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,799
And, yeah, I mean, it changes.

649
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,799
I always say that everything is in the menu,

650
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,799
it's all written for you,

651
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,799
what's there, click and type.

652
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,799
So, yeah, I follow that logic.

653
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,799
I look at what's written,

654
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,799
and if it's useful, I type it.

655
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,799
But yeah, okay, in the back,

656
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,799
I know a little, theoretically,

657
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
what needs to be done, but...

658
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Did you go to school?

659
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

660
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know.

661
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So, you went to school,

662
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and then you did podcasts.

663
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
No, no, because you asked me

664
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
where I learned all that stuff.

665
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You didn't go to school,

667
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
where you learned all that stuff.

668
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I mean, you studied multimedia, right?

669
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No, I studied media communication.

670
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh, sorry.

671
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
We didn't, okay,

672
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
we didn't just work technically

673
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
in the media and production,

674
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
and everything,

675
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
but also from other perspectives,

676
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
why and how, and stuff like that.

677
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
But that other geek talk,

678
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
which I really like,

679
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
media criticism,

680
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
and stuff like that.

681
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Media criticism?

682
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

683
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Now we have a debate here,

684
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
and we can do some media criticism.

685
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:53,399
I did a podcast, which is just

686
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,399
positivism, without criticism.

687
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,399
I got that feeling.

688
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,399
Criticism is so positive.

689
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,399
Yeah, that's true.

690
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:03,399
But anyway,

691
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:05,399
through the media studies,

692
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,399
I was absolutely lucky

693
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,399
with a slightly higher level

694
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,399
of production equipment,

695
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,399
which is different.

696
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:15,399
That's the best compliment I've ever heard.

697
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,399
I mean, okay,

698
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm not as lucky as I am,

699
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
because I did something else

700
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
when I went to lectures.

701
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
But yeah,

702
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
more than anything else,

703
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I fell into the details.

704
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah,

705
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
we'll stop there.

706
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Okay.

707
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
I made a mistake

708
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
when we were talking

709
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
to Jan last time,

710
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
and we started asking him,

711
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
well, okay,

712
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,799
who will do it?

713
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,799
Who has to do it?

714
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,799
I have to do it,

715
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,799
you have to do it.

716
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,799
And he said,

717
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,799
that's a great question.

718
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,799
I can send you an example

719
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,799
of what an agenda looks like

720
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,799
for social media,

721
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,799
communication,

722
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,799
plan, division.

723
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,799
I said, we could make more clips.

724
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,799
But it's still yours.

725
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,799
It's still your job.

726
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Now,

727
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I would like you

728
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
to tell us

729
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
if you get,

730
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
if you have a real budget,

731
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
or if,

732
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
whatever it is,

733
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it doesn't matter,

734
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and you have to put together

735
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
a media plan,

736
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
an agenda,

737
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
how will you release it,

738
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
where will you put it?

739
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Okay.

740
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Do you have an idea

741
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
of what this podcast

742
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
could look like?

743
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
No, I would like to see

744
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
and listen to

745
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
what this preparation

746
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
or agenda looks like

747
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
that you have to prepare

748
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
for some other

749
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
production team.

750
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Let Tomáš decide.

751
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Okay,

752
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
I'll try to simplify it a bit.

753
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Because,

754
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,399
first of all,

755
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,399
you have to decide

756
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,399
what kind of market

757
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,399
you're entering,

758
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,399
what you're doing,

759
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,399
and then,

760
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,399
depending on the market

761
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,399
and what you start with,

762
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,399
you'll see

763
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,400
what you can cover.

764
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
And now,

765
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
the podcast probably won't

766
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
go to social media,

767
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
but in the magazine,

768
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,599
on the other hand,

769
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,599
it's a standard to do marketing

770
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,599
through social media,

771
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,599
because you don't get paid

772
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,599
for anything else,

773
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,599
especially not for something

774
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,599
that is absolutely

775
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,599
digitally distributed.

776
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,599
So, you stay digital.

777
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,599
What are the social media

778
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,599
that are

779
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,599
interesting enough

780
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,599
for...

781
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,599
Boomer questions.

782
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,599
We only left one on Twitter.

783
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,599
So, what's next?

784
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,599
Now, maybe a better question

785
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,599
is where not to go.

786
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,599
Okay, fair enough.

787
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,599
So,

788
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,599
if you remember

789
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,599
everyone you want to meet,

790
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,599
I mean, you want to be present,

791
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,599
even if it's just

792
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,599
a re-share of your other

793
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,599
profiles.

794
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,599
Now, for the podcast,

795
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,599
again, who will listen to

796
00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:40,799
the podcast?

797
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:42,799
Is it for the younger audience

798
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:44,799
or for the older ones,

799
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,799
or is it for everyone?

800
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:48,799
If it's only for the older ones,

801
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:50,799
don't put it on TikTok.

802
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,799
I don't know

803
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,799
what's going on

804
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,799
on Snapchat.

805
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,799
I don't think

806
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,799
everyone is for something like that.

807
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:06,799
So, I would say

808
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
everything is covered.

809
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Now, TikTok has to be covered

810
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
even if you're doing, I don't know what.

811
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's funny to meet

812
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
people who clean the table,

813
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't know, the facade,

814
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
the windows, and so on.

815
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
They are completely involved

816
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
in TikTok.

817
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's a huge conversion.

818
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I mean, who...

819
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah, we're old.

820
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Young entrepreneurs also have TikTok.

821
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I think that

822
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
you have to ask yourself

823
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
why you would do it.

824
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
The question is

825
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
why someone

826
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
who cleans the windows

827
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
on TikTok

828
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
doesn't do it to sell on TikTok?

829
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Yeah, or maybe not.

830
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
What's the endgame?

831
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
I don't know, but

832
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
if you look at a brand awareness

833
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
and you're present

834
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
and you see it,

835
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
that's why someone

836
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
is selling something.

837
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I would say

838
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
let's say you're not on TikTok.

839
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
You can go to Facebook or Instagram

840
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
or maybe Twitter.

841
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
If you're on Facebook or Instagram

842
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
you will definitely post stories

843
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
and announce something.

844
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Why wouldn't you post them on TikTok?

845
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Yeah, if you're doing it.

846
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,599
I mean, the first problem

847
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,599
is to create content

848
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,599
and if you have content

849
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,599
it's almost nothing

850
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,599
because you're announcing everything.

851
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,599
I say almost because...

852
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,599
But you know what?

853
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,599
You said

854
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,599
media communication in the media.

855
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
But I think these channels have

856
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,599
everything specific.

857
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,599
If I put this person

858
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,599
on LinkedIn, there are people

859
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,799
who are more professional

860
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,799
and more...

861
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:05,799
industrial?

862
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,799
Everyone is on LinkedIn.

863
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:09,799
LinkedIn is special.

864
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,799
On TikTok we can't...

865
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,799
You have a non-professional relationship

866
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,799
that everyone knows.

867
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,799
I mean,

868
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,799
does it hurt you

869
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:21,799
if you post something

870
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,799
that's relevant

871
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,799
and those people who don't see it

872
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,799
don't care.

873
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What if you post it on Parler?

874
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But can we generally

875
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
look at these media

876
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
as a one-way TV channel?

877
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Do we have to look at them

878
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
as a two-way channel?

879
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I mean, if you want to have an engagement

880
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and then look for an engagement

881
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
you have to look.

882
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Look at the experience.

883
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If you put this person

884
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
anywhere in the media

885
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
if there's no engagement

886
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
then it goes nicely

887
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
among other people.

888
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
When you think of content

889
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
you won't put a podcast

890
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
on TikTok, right?

891
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
But what to post?

892
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I think

893
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
social media is a huge

894
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
pain when it comes to

895
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
presence, to promote

896
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
the main content.

897
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
These are absolutely

898
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
supportive channels

899
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
for what you do.

900
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
I've been saying

901
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
for a long time

902
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
that it doesn't matter

903
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
if you promote a community

904
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
or a person

905
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
to be heard

906
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
but you work for the algorithm

907
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
because if you don't

908
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
persuade the algorithm

909
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
to push you forward

910
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
you can have the best content ever.

911
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
The algorithm wants quantity.

912
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
But the question is

913
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
do you want this war with the algorithm?

914
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
What's that?

915
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Endgame.

916
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
It's like this.

917
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
We're hobby chablis

918
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
and we always have 12 girls

919
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
and we don't know

920
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
if we'll have 20 km per year

921
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
or 5 km per year.

922
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
If you're a professional chablis

923
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
then yes.

924
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
That's the debate

925
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
we had before we started

926
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
recording.

927
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
How are you going to pack it?

928
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
You're saying that

929
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
we should focus on good content

930
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
and how to hype it

931
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
well

932
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
and sell it well

933
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
or fight with the algorithm

934
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
to push the algorithm

935
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
but the content

936
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
won't be the best.

937
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
But I'll make sure

938
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
that I'll be seen

939
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
in the audience.

940
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
In the minds of people

941
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
or followers

942
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
you'll see that

943
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
there's a team

944
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
that starts

945
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
from the bottom

946
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
but the question is

947
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
are they that relevant

948
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
or do they have good content

949
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
or did they just destroy

950
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
the SEO against the algorithm

951
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
to get there?

952
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
A good example of this

953
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
is

954
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
a bad example of this

955
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
is content farming

956
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
or the YouTube

957
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
version of

958
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
tasty videos

959
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
or do-it-yourself hacks

960
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
or some

961
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
trash content

962
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
with billions of views

963
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
that does

964
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
exactly what you said.

965
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
They just push the algorithm.

966
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
No quality,

967
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
no business,

968
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
but it saves them

969
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
because that's their business model

970
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
to be seen.

971
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
If we look at this podcast

972
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
I believe that

973
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
it's set up well

974
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
and there are good guests

975
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
that's why I don't want to

976
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
fight with the algorithm.

977
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Now

978
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
if you want to

979
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
distribute

980
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
and promote this good content

981
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
you need

982
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
to have this game.

983
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
But only because

984
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
your main content

985
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
will be seen

986
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
because if you post

987
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
once a week

988
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
with a podcast

989
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
the algorithm won't push

990
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
because you didn't have

991
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
other posts.

992
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Even if you post

993
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
a meme every day

994
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
the algorithm doesn't recognize

995
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
what kind of question it is.

996
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Consistent frequency.

997
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Yes.

998
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
That's it.

999
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
You don't need to

1000
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
study all the hacks

1001
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
because

1002
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
it doesn't pay off

1003
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
because you start working

1004
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
on Facebook,

1005
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
you can hack the algorithm

1006
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
as much as you want

1007
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
if you don't give them

1008
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,199
everything.

1009
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,199
Maybe we'll see

1010
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,199
I don't know.

1011
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,199
I have some experiences

1012
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,199
from another project

1013
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,199
where

1014
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,199
it turned out

1015
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,199
that

1016
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:21,199
there is

1017
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,199
such a specific person

1018
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,199
that it turned out

1019
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,199
that this specific targeted audience

1020
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,199
exists on Twitter

1021
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,199
and then they tried

1022
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,199
to do the same on Facebook,

1023
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,199
Instagram and so on

1024
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,199
and they quickly realized

1025
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,199
that they can't do it.

1026
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,199
That's because

1027
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,199
it's a very specific topic

1028
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,199
and it's a step

1029
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,199
of quite a lot

1030
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,199
of influencers

1031
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,199
that we know

1032
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,199
that pushed

1033
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,199
the fight

1034
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,199
against the algorithm.

1035
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,199
I can imagine

1036
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,199
that it's hard

1037
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,199
if you have

1038
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,199
a very specific task

1039
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,199
and then it's easy

1040
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:11,199
to push it out.

1041
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,199
I remember

1042
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,199
that you participated

1043
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,199
in some festivals

1044
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,199
and now you're talking

1045
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,199
about meetups

1046
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,199
and events.

1047
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,199
Yes, specifically

1048
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:27,199
for B-sides and so on.

1049
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,199
Your success

1050
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,199
of one event

1051
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,199
depends on

1052
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:35,199
how many people

1053
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,199
you attract.

1054
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,199
I think that

1055
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,199
for this use case

1056
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,199
Facebook is

1057
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:45,199
a place where you can

1058
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:47,199
attract money.

1059
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,199
You can't build

1060
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,199
such a big audience in such a short time.

1061
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,199
Facebook also told you

1062
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,199
a funny story.

1063
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,199
Yes, probably it's

1064
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:59,199
a hole in the fence

1065
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,199
and you have to pay

1066
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:03,199
a lot of money

1067
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,199
to get there.

1068
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,199
It's an ongoing game.

1069
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,199
That's how it is with Facebook.

1070
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:11,199
First you upload some content

1071
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,199
and after some time

1072
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:15,199
you get a post

1073
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,199
pay 5 euros to reach

1074
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,199
1000 of your followers

1075
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,199
and when you

1076
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:23,199
say it

1077
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,199
you pay

1078
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,199
5 euros

1079
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,199
and then

1080
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,199
21 euros

1081
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,199
and at the end

1082
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,199
you say

1083
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,199
it's just a platform

1084
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,199
where we will passively reference

1085
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:41,199
content or events

1086
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:43,199
on that platform

1087
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,199
and we will not

1088
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,199
look at it.

1089
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,199
Do you think that

1090
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:53,199
fighting against this algorithm

1091
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:55,199
is not the same as

1092
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,199
creating a good

1093
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,199
base of followers

1094
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,199
who consider

1095
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,199
content as

1096
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,199
a valuable

1097
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:07,199
sharing?

1098
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,199
And

1099
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,199
this kind of base

1100
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:13,199
starts to be shared.

1101
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,199
You have more people

1102
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:17,199
who try to share

1103
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:19,199
the same content

1104
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,199
and when you

1105
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,199
share it

1106
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,199
because

1107
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,199
they see

1108
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:29,199
here I learned something

1109
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:31,199
and here I learned something.

1110
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:33,199
It's worth hearing.

1111
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,199
This is

1112
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,199
an organic growth.

1113
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,199
You have to get there.

1114
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,199
And now

1115
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:43,199
with this podcast

1116
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,199
I think that

1117
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,199
it's fully connected

1118
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:49,199
and you can see

1119
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,199
that it gets reach

1120
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:53,199
I don't know

1121
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:55,199
why it would be limited

1122
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,199
only to this.

1123
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:59,199
Maybe you don't fight

1124
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:01,199
directly with the algorithm

1125
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:03,199
but you prepare

1126
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,199
one post a day

1127
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,199
for a few months

1128
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,199
whatever it is.

1129
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,199
And that's it.

1130
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,199
You just keep going.

1131
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,199
Just to get there.

1132
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,199
The problem is that it's not.

1133
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:19,199
Because now someone

1134
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:21,199
will go to the grave

1135
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:23,199
and google it

1136
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:25,199
and maybe they'll come to Anchor

1137
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,199
and they'll want to see more

1138
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,199
but now there are no profiles.

1139
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,199
You said that the biggest problem

1140
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,199
is that it's not on YouTube.

1141
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:35,199
You have to search on YouTube.

1142
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,199
Let's talk about

1143
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,199
two things

1144
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,199
that we can talk about.

1145
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,199
One is the audience

1146
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:47,199
and the other is the feedback.

1147
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:49,199
Those things are very important.

1148
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,199
Let's talk about that

1149
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,199
and maybe we'll get more specific.

1150
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:57,199
I think that the first audience

1151
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,199
is still

1152
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,199
the first degree network

1153
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,199
meaning the people you know

1154
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,199
the people you work with

1155
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,199
that's the first network

1156
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,199
you have around you.

1157
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,199
We try to

1158
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,199
lean on them

1159
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,199
so they'll listen

1160
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,199
and give us feedback.

1161
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,199
You know that they're biased

1162
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,199
because they know us

1163
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,199
and the topic is very close

1164
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,199
and maybe they live in that industry

1165
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:27,199
but I don't know if it's because of us.

1166
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:29,199
You're not old enough to listen to them.

1167
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:33,199
My dad listened to that episode

1168
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,199
I wrote him

1169
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,199
and he was like

1170
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:39,199
how much do you charge?

1171
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,199
I think he listened to it with Janko.

1172
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,199
My dad is

1173
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,199
a real entrepreneur

1174
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,199
and a manager

1175
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:55,199
but yeah

1176
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:57,199
he's an old school entrepreneur

1177
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:01,199
and he's not close to the audience

1178
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,199
so I can't say he's a target audience

1179
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:05,199
and it would be pointless

1180
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:07,199
for that audience.

1181
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:09,199
But you get good feedback.

1182
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:11,199
We get a lot.

1183
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,199
I think that episode wasn't interesting

1184
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:15,199
but there are other episodes

1185
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:17,199
and other sections.

1186
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,199
If you listen to Janko's speech

1187
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,199
in a previous episode

1188
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,199
in his own language

1189
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,199
and he says

1190
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:27,199
OK, that can't be interesting.

1191
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:29,199
If you listen to the episode

1192
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,199
with Rod Petrovic

1193
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,199
when he talks about Slovenia

1194
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,199
and the Serbian economy

1195
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:37,199
it's interesting.

1196
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:39,199
If you listen to the episode

1197
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,199
where Saro talks about recruitment

1198
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,199
and technology

1199
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,199
it's possible

1200
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:47,199
to expand

1201
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,199
the population

1202
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:51,199
but

1203
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,199
Brodoj said something really good

1204
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,199
about the core audience.

1205
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,199
Do you agree with that?

1206
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:59,199
How big should your audience be?

1207
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,199
What?

1208
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,199
Do you remember when you said

1209
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,199
seven years?

1210
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:07,199
Yeah, yeah.

1211
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,199
That really resonates with me.

1212
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,199
An engineer would think

1213
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,199
what is a minimal viable product

1214
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,199
but we think

1215
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:17,199
what is a minimal viable audience.

1216
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:19,199
For us

1217
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,199
what is a minimal viable audience

1218
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,199
is also a question.

1219
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,199
What

1220
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:27,199
do you expect from this podcast?

1221
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,199
You need to know

1222
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,199
OK, you have

1223
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,199
four well-dressed people

1224
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:35,199
who

1225
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,199
sit here with a microphone

1226
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:39,199
every one of us

1227
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:41,199
worked on commercial projects

1228
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:43,199
and deserve

1229
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,199
a part of their apartment.

1230
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,199
So

1231
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:49,199
you need to ask yourself

1232
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,199
how many people

1233
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,199
cover you

1234
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,199
no matter what it means.

1235
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,199
And people are different.

1236
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:59,199
I am a community of

1237
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,199
a lot of people.

1238
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
in the last 15 years

1239
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
a lot of my life

1240
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
and maybe a bit too much

1241
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and let's say

1242
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
for me personally, this podcast

1243
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
it turns out

1244
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
to be very challenging

1245
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and has less words

1246
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
than if I recorded an episode

1247
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
from a textbook

1248
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
yes, ok, we don't have

1249
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
those... we don't have to

1250
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
embrace ourselves as programmers

1251
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
but

1252
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
sometimes it's not a problem

1253
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
or maybe

1254
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
we'll say something later

1255
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
maybe we'll combine it with

1256
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
a physical event

1257
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
on the other hand

1258
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm also thinking

1259
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
about this anecdote about pornography

1260
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
because I use it a lot

1261
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
we've been waiting for this

1262
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
we've been waiting for this, yes

1263
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I mean, people can watch

1264
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
highly produced pornography

1265
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
good actors, good cameramen

1266
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
good actors, good screenwriters

1267
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
make-up scene and so on

1268
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
yes, yes

1269
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
but in the end

1270
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
this amateur porn

1271
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
has its own passion

1272
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
because it's not

1273
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
highly produced

1274
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and now

1275
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
it's hard to compete

1276
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
with

1277
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
a highly produced

1278
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
American

1279
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
content

1280
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
we can start doing it in English

1281
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
but in the end we'll get lost

1282
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
in the sea

1283
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
of this content

1284
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and that's the second

1285
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
anecdote about pornography

1286
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
you can have a girl

1287
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
who speaks English like a stock

1288
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
or a woman, we won't be chauvinists here

1289
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
but maybe

1290
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
a girl or a woman

1291
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
who speaks Hungarian like a stock

1292
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I don't know

1293
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I mean, yes, ok

1294
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
you still have to understand Slovenian

1295
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I want to know where

1296
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
this will lead to

1297
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
but I want to say

1298
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that maybe you'll find

1299
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
a minimal viable audience

1300
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and that it's cool

1301
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and that you're happy with yourself

1302
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and you'll be able to

1303
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
make money

1304
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
because you're producing

1305
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
or you're just filling it up with energy

1306
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and you're working for reference

1307
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
or I don't know

1308
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Fame and glory

1309
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Jesus Christ

1310
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I don't know about that

1311
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I already understood that

1312
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
this fame and glory

1313
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
will be able to monetize

1314
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I mean, if we don't pour

1315
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
pure wine

1316
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I was

1317
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
active in CyberPipa

1318
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and we were fighting for sponsors

1319
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
so that the space could exist

1320
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and when I went

1321
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
to the company

1322
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
it was like

1323
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
ok, your content

1324
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
is not for our pages

1325
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
marketing, sales funnel

1326
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
technological page

1327
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
that I went to

1328
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
to support

1329
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
they said, if we're the first to sign up

1330
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
these are not our pages

1331
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and now

1332
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
they're listening to us

1333
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
these are not even our pages

1334
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
no matter how much time we spend on it

1335
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
maybe

1336
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
God will give

1337
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
a good word

1338
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
and he'll say

1339
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I think these people here

1340
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
are really cool

1341
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
in the community

1342
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
maybe they'd just hire him

1343
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
for 60€ per hour

1344
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
to fix the Kubernetes cluster

1345
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
you have to think

1346
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
no

1347
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
we'll do this

1348
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
as a community

1349
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
what is the minimal viable audience

1350
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and how

1351
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
do you increase

1352
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
or decrease it if you're in Slovenia

1353
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
or do you want more

1354
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
podcasts that are more comprehensive

1355
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
that more people understand

1356
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
if you have podcasts like Blissar

1357
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
or Rodon

1358
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that are more approachable

1359
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
but on the other hand

1360
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
you lose the Hungarian

1361
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Janko

1362
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
or at least me

1363
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
that I'm coding in Kubernetes

1364
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I don't know

1365
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I think

1366
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I see it

1367
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
as a community based

1368
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
everyone

1369
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
has a professional

1370
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
career

1371
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
and starts doing things

1372
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that

1373
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
if I use

1374
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
the words

1375
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
of my father

1376
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
we remember

1377
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
but we remember

1378
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
with a bit of passion

1379
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
with a vision

1380
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that is based

1381
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
on our professional

1382
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
career or

1383
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
something that we've already experienced

1384
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
it can be anecdotes

1385
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
it can be war stories

1386
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
it can be events

1387
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
we have our

1388
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
social network of people

1389
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
that are interesting

1390
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
that we introduce them here

1391
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and their views

1392
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and experiences

1393
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and I

1394
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
perceive it as

1395
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
a return to the community

1396
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
or

1397
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
an awareness

1398
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
that is happening here

1399
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
my philosophy is very similar

1400
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
my philosophy is

1401
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that

1402
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
if

1403
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
at some point in your career

1404
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I think at this point

1405
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
in your life

1406
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you get the opportunity

1407
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
to give back to the community

1408
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
it's your duty

1409
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
if you had a good mentor

1410
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
it's your duty

1411
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
to become a good mentor

1412
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and in a way

1413
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
you try to give back

1414
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and

1415
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
this podcast

1416
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
meetups

1417
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Slovenian budget

1418
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and also

1419
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Slovenian development

1420
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
and open source

1421
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
if you give back

1422
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
you improve the ecosystem

1423
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
if the ecosystem is healthy

1424
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
if the ecosystem is good

1425
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
if people learn from these things

1426
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
if they become better

1427
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and if they are better

1428
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
if we have better projects

1429
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
it's a blessing

1430
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
for everything

1431
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and

1432
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
if we build good

1433
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
relationships

1434
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
good

1435
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
we exchange experiences

1436
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
then we get

1437
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
not partners, but co-workers

1438
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
like a cat

1439
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
a cat

1440
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
it's all very healthy

1441
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
the Hungarian industry is more English

1442
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I don't know

1443
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I just

1444
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
as I would say

1445
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I look at it from a different perspective

1446
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
when we got together

1447
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
when he explained

1448
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
the concept

1449
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
who are the guests

1450
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and all that

1451
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and

1452
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
his vision

1453
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and also

1454
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
the access

1455
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
to all these guests

1456
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and

1457
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I don't know

1458
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I see the potential

1459
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
that this podcast will survive

1460
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
because I think

1461
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
it's not a

1462
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
hard struggle

1463
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
to get a guest

1464
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
and with that also personal

1465
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
the fact that it's

1466
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
so niche is

1467
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
an absolute plus

1468
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
because if you cover a niche

1469
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
even if it's in Slovenia

1470
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
at first I don't accept

1471
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Slovenian guests

1472
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
of course

1473
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
but

1474
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
they have their own value

1475
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
absolutely

1476
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I don't know

1477
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
because I'm not a developer

1478
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I just know this community

1479
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
directly through

1480
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
their forums

1481
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and it's obvious

1482
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
that the engagement

1483
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
that people are interested in

1484
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I don't know

1485
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
if it's a need

1486
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
maybe

1487
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I don't know

1488
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Do you think it's a need

1489
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
if we turn it off in the morning

1490
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
people will write

1491
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
no, no

1492
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
it would be nice to hear

1493
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I mean

1494
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
probably if it comes to the routine

1495
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
that people will watch it on Monday

1496
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
in the morning

1497
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and then it will come

1498
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I don't know

1499
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Feedback is very interesting

1500
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
because

1501
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
we don't know

1502
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I mean we don't know

1503
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
it will depend on what you most

1504
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
agree with

1505
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that engagement

1506
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
because of your engagement

1507
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
that you started through social

1508
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
is it really

1509
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
interesting

1510
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
because of the content

1511
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and they wanted

1512
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
to give something back

1513
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I don't know

1514
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I think that

1515
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I would like to hear these things

1516
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I want these stories

1517
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
that we make

1518
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
to share

1519
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I want the stories

1520
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
like Rodo's

1521
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Janko's

1522
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
all the stories before

1523
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I think they are so powerful

1524
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
inspiring stories

1525
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
for young engineers

1526
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
for experienced engineers

1527
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
that it's possible

1528
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
you are not crazy

1529
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
if you do these things

1530
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
people do these things

1531
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
full of these stories

1532
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
like you said

1533
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
for a long time in the industry

1534
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
you heard some horrible

1535
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and interesting stories

1536
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I think it's interesting

1537
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
to share them

1538
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
on the other hand

1539
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
infrastructure

1540
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
code, javascript

1541
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
some niches

1542
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
it's interesting

1543
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
if we go now

1544
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
to the feedback

1545
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
maybe I mentioned

1546
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
a lot of answers

1547
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
maybe go to English

1548
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
then you will have a bigger audience

1549
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
maybe you will see

1550
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
what kind of a guest he is

1551
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
maybe here

1552
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I think that

1553
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
in our podcasts

1554
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
there were Turks

1555
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and Slovenes

1556
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
who still live in Tuin

1557
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
so we have a kind of Turks

1558
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
let's speak English

1559
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
we all work

1560
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
for the English market

1561
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
for 10 years

1562
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
English is not a problem

1563
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
for us as a host

1564
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
even for our guests

1565
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
the question is

1566
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
how our audience

1567
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
will react

1568
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
will our audience accept it

1569
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
or not

1570
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and then you start

1571
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
to put it in the box

1572
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
in some Tuin podcast

1573
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
really?

1574
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I think to some extent

1575
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
because the topic

1576
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
when it comes to javascript

1577
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
it's something

1578
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
on a global level

1579
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
it's not just about

1580
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Slovenian economy

1581
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
the question is

1582
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
will you

1583
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
as an Englishman

1584
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I mean in English

1585
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
say that you will target

1586
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
the audience

1587
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
maybe it will be interesting

1588
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
but they will not be able

1589
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
to change anything

1590
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
if you target Slovenia

1591
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and some Slovenian listeners

1592
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
who would be interested

1593
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
this is the problem

1594
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
they can engage

1595
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
will we have Dr. Pedrama

1596
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
security expert

1597
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
in Slovenia?

1598
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
in Slovenian?

1599
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
yes or no?

1600
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm looking forward to meeting

1601
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
a Slovenian woman

1602
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
everything is possible

1603
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I would say

1604
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
that

1605
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I think it's a unnecessary question

1606
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
to work in Slovenian

1607
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
or in English

1608
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
one or the other

1609
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
podcast

1610
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
as such

1611
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
the topic is

1612
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
now

1613
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
if the episodes are

1614
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
more local

1615
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
with local themes

1616
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
they are absolutely

1617
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
necessary in Slovenian

1618
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
because no one in English

1619
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
has listened to what is happening here in Ljubljana

1620
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
on the other hand

1621
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
why not

1622
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
invite a Tuin guest

1623
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
who will speak English

1624
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
because then you will get

1625
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
his audience

1626
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
but also his local audience

1627
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
you will get

1628
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
who will know

1629
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
the city because of where he came from

1630
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I don't know

1631
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I see it

1632
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
as an added value

1633
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I think

1634
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
it sounds very new

1635
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
but here is the filmmaker

1636
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
look how beautiful he is

1637
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
look at him

1638
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
he is right here

1639
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I think that

1640
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Slovenian people are

1641
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
the basic filmmaker

1642
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
and Ljubljana is

1643
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
a bit more pro-filmmaker

1644
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
the people

1645
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
who are present here

1646
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
will be a bit more relaxed

1647
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
if they are human

1648
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
if we work every day

1649
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
we speak more English

1650
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
than in Slovenian

1651
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I think that

1652
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I will not speak English

1653
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
with Goran

1654
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I think

1655
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
that is

1656
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
one of the things

1657
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
that adds simplicity

1658
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
we are

1659
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
we are

1660
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
we talked a bit

1661
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
in the past

1662
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
you have this framework

1663
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
cool

1664
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
about the framework

1665
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
we can also

1666
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
create sub-booklets

1667
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
sub-things

1668
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
and

1669
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
all these episodes

1670
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
go from

1671
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
casually reading things

1672
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
to almost meta-interviews

1673
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
to

1674
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
last time with Mark

1675
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
we were more prepared

1676
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
than we know

1677
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
and the question is

1678
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
do we need only

1679
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
this platform

1680
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
under this platform we can

1681
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
create sub-titles

1682
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
that serve

1683
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
a different audience

1684
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
or from a different point of view

1685
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
you work for the audience

1686
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
but this platform can

1687
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
serve our creators

1688
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
if I want to read

1689
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
explicit content

1690
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
be salty on

1691
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
PHP

1692
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
drink it

1693
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
if I want to

1694
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
it still has to be

1695
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
a production need

1696
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
coherent

1697
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
it can also be classic

1698
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
interviews where we have

1699
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
more

1700
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
more approach

1701
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
this is the domain of interviews

1702
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
no, no, no

1703
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I think

1704
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
you said better

1705
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
what you said

1706
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I definitely agree

1707
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
it's an award

1708
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
that can have its own path

1709
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
do you think so?

1710
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
absolutely

1711
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I think

1712
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
bigger podcasts

1713
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
have bonus episodes

1714
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
or a special section

1715
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
it's not a problem of diversification

1716
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
the question is

1717
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
we all know

1718
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I have a fantasy view

1719
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I have a feeling

1720
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
what do you expect from this podcast

1721
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
if you don't know

1722
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
but what is it

1723
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
it's a platform

1724
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
that you can

1725
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
experiment

1726
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
but it's not

1727
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
for real

1728
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
to be able

1729
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
to find

1730
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
something for our

1731
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
commercial product

1732
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and also

1733
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
nobody dictates

1734
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
how it goes

1735
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
how not

1736
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I mean

1737
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
here

1738
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
he said it without agenda

1739
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
the thing was

1740
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
this section needs

1741
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
a name

1742
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
let's write a few names

1743
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
and then

1744
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
where did you get it

1745
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I hid it

1746
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
internal dictatorship

1747
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
is easy

1748
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
it's cool

1749
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
because

1750
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
in a way it's a vision

1751
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
not a direction

1752
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
the worst thing

1753
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
was that

1754
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
you draw a plan

1755
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
you stick to it

1756
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and then you realize

1757
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that it doesn't work

1758
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
and you are stressed out

1759
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
and I don't know

1760
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
if there would be

1761
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
feedback

1762
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
do you have any questions

1763
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
for these guests

1764
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and then additional questions

1765
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
if it's real

1766
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
if we go

1767
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
back to feedback

1768
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
when you sign up

1769
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
for

1770
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
YC Combinator

1771
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
it's one of the best

1772
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
professional accelerators

1773
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
in the world

1774
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
in San Francisco

1775
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Dropbox and similar companies

1776
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
because it's a crime

1777
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
to do a crime

1778
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and on a public image

1779
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
from YCI

1780
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
the question is

1781
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
which things

1782
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
does your startup start

1783
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
in this phase

1784
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
that is escalating today

1785
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
which things are you doing now

1786
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
or which things

1787
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
do you start

1788
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
that gave you

1789
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
a look

1790
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
at the beginning

1791
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and maybe later when

1792
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
the corporation is in you

1793
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
you don't have to

1794
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
but at the beginning

1795
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
they help you grow

1796
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and

1797
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
a few things

1798
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
that I see

1799
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and I will ask you

1800
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I see that it won't escalate

1801
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
but now they are

1802
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
extremely valuable

1803
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
now

1804
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
we have stickers

1805
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
so if you meet someone

1806
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
we have stickers

1807
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and stickers

1808
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
it's escalating

1809
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
it's escalating

1810
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
but I think

1811
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I go to a lot of events

1812
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
meetups

1813
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
lectures and so on

1814
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
and

1815
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I imagine

1816
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
that there are people

1817
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
who do this for you

1818
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and if I see a colleague

1819
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
who is a system engineer

1820
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
we haven't seen each other for a while

1821
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and I ask him what he does

1822
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and I ask him

1823
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
if he knows this thing

1824
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
if he discovered it

1825
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
and if he didn't

1826
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
it's very valuable

1827
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
information

1828
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
and I'm interested

1829
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
if he listens

1830
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
to any person

1831
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
does he even know

1832
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that this thing exists

1833
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
why doesn't he know

1834
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
if I listen to the channels

1835
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
we talked about

1836
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I won't mention him

1837
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and what do I say

1838
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
we put a sticker

1839
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
what is the point

1840
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and most people

1841
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
who are interested

1842
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
at that moment they pull out their phone

1843
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
and try to look for this thing

1844
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
or go to their studio

1845
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and what happens

1846
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
what I've seen

1847
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
is that people open YouTube

1848
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and start looking for it

1849
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
on YouTube

1850
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
and that's a good feedback

1851
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
that you get

1852
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
if you go to your audience

1853
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
and talk to them

1854
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
and discover

1855
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I just don't know

1856
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
if you're going to invest

1857
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
in TikTok or YouTube

1858
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
yes

1859
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
but it's a good feedback

1860
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
if I just sit here

1861
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
and just

1862
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
put it in this clip

1863
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
it's a very good feeling

1864
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
if I put it on this channel

1865
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and if I don't announce it

1866
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
it goes to waste

1867
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and

1868
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
this initial audience

1869
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
builds up

1870
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
and people ask what do they expect

1871
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
what do they see

1872
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
have they listened

1873
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
and I see that those

1874
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
who are on-board

1875
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I say

1876
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
listen and tell me if it's for you

1877
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and a lot of people write

1878
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
yes I listened, it's very good

1879
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
and I see that

1880
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
in some way you listen and build

1881
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
if I just jump in

1882
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
you mentioned

1883
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
that you go to meetups

1884
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and events

1885
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I see

1886
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
that

1887
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
why couldn't

1888
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
a garden go to an event

1889
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
why couldn't it be

1890
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
like a

1891
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't know, a message

1892
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
but why couldn't

1893
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
a meetup get a guest

1894
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and an episode from that

1895
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
you can respect that

1896
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
as a journalist

1897
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I don't know

1898
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I mean

1899
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I

1900
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
with people

1901
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I think we have

1902
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
100 episodes

1903
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
it's not a problem

1904
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
all that feedback

1905
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
that people write

1906
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
that they would come

1907
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and say something

1908
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
and sell

1909
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
but

1910
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
if we go back

1911
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
what is the point

1912
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
what is the purpose

1913
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't know

1914
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
if we are going to

1915
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
directly try to sell

1916
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
or

1917
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
that's not the point

1918
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I want to be global

1919
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and with such a person

1920
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
maybe there will be people

1921
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I don't want to exclude

1922
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
but if they can tell me

1923
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
details, if they can speak passionately

1924
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
about their technologies

1925
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
all the market secrets

1926
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
yes

1927
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I want to be able to tell

1928
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
how to do it

1929
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I can sell myself

1930
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but I'm really interested

1931
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I don't know how many

1932
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
meetups we had

1933
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
because I have no idea

1934
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
what it looks like

1935
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
it's interesting

1936
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
because we talked

1937
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
about it

1938
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
because I think

1939
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
it's worth it

1940
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
it's definitely good

1941
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
to have a podcast

1942
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
like this

1943
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
and in the end

1944
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
we have a lot of

1945
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
unprofitable

1946
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
unprofitable

1947
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
unprofitable

1948
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
please explain it

1949
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
in Slovenia it's like this

1950
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
in Tuin

1951
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
unprofitable means

1952
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
that you get paid

1953
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
but you don't make a profit

1954
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
NGO looks different

1955
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
for example

1956
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
CyberPIP

1957
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
for a while

1958
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
was under the name

1959
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
K4 through 6

1960
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
then suddenly

1961
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
it became zero

1962
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
at some point

1963
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
you as a member

1964
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
of the community

1965
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
have the capital

1966
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
to live and serve

1967
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
the community

1968
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
and you have

1969
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
some kind of community work

1970
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
you're happy

1971
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
if you do zero

1972
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
because there is no space

1973
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and no cold law

1974
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
because of electricity

1975
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
but your volunteers

1976
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
or people who organized it

1977
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
don't have any compensation

1978
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
It's just that they have expenses.

1979
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
What we normally get from the school,

1980
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I don't know if it's the same now,

1981
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
it's completely different.

1982
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1983
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I think it's not a problem for me to come to an event

1984
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
because I know that those people anyway,

1985
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I won't say,

1986
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
well, I can say that,

1987
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
but I'll say that they're hiding something.

1988
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Now, when you're a student, you have more time,

1989
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
you can compensate with work,

1990
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
when you're a little older,

1991
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
you'll be ready to pay more.

1992
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
But maybe this event can also help

1993
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the community,

1994
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
from the point of view,

1995
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
aha, you're a part of this event,

1996
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I was there,

1997
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
there was this event,

1998
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and then when you're looking for sponsors

1999
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
to cover expenses next year,

2000
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
you can finally offer this podcast,

2001
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
where you say, hey,

2002
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
this podcast is great,

2003
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
there are some synergies that can be made.

2004
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
On the other hand,

2005
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I don't know,

2006
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
if someone comes

2007
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
who doesn't sell themselves,

2008
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
and is ready to say something technical,

2009
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
it's definitely interesting for our audience.

2010
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Or I also think that

2011
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
in this flow of

2012
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
general knowledge,

2013
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
or general content,

2014
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I think,

2015
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
maybe someone is ready

2016
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
between

2017
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
OTA,

2018
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
or me, or Naio, or Nestri,

2019
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
or whoever,

2020
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
to ask this flow of questions.

2021
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Because you can have, I don't know,

2022
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
a conference

2023
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
about digital cities,

2024
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and then you have a bunch of people there,

2025
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
maybe

2026
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
someone is interested

2027
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
to be a little technical,

2028
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
out of people, in a conference,

2029
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
to bring out some technical things.

2030
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I think that we have

2031
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
a good

2032
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
beer for that.

2033
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Because we know how to ask questions.

2034
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
If we always know enough,

2035
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
we know how to ask questions.

2036
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yes, absolutely.

2037
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Andraž, do you want to add something?

2038
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
No, no, no.

2039
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Well, yes.

2040
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
The bottom line

2041
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
with this feedback is

2042
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
that it's huge,

2043
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
that I really want to hear it,

2044
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
that I really appreciate it,

2045
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
that it's not only art

2046
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
that people will give feedback,

2047
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
but also

2048
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
objective feedback is

2049
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
extremely hard to get.

2050
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
If you learn that,

2051
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
if I ask you directly,

2052
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
do you like it?

2053
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It's very likely

2054
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
that people

2055
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
find it harder

2056
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
to give negative feedback

2057
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
than to give

2058
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
positive feedback.

2059
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
You also got a few

2060
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
negative feedbacks.

2061
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
The most negative feedback

2062
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I got was from you.

2063
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Sorry, sorry.

2064
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
But that's why

2065
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
it's so huge.

2066
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I wanted to be in a balance

2067
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
between constructive

2068
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
and constructive criticism.

2069
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Yes, absolutely.

2070
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
You have to circle

2071
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
in a way with experts

2072
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
who give a wide range

2073
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and both.

2074
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
If we all nod,

2075
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
yes, yes, yes, great, great,

2076
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
we won't improve.

2077
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
If at the beginning

2078
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
we were given

2079
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
great sounds,

2080
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
if we were invited

2081
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
to improve it,

2082
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
we wouldn't even try.

2083
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
It's the same with YouTube.

2084
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
If we don't

2085
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
stop it,

2086
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
it's better

2087
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
to finish it.

2088
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
For example, TikTok,

2089
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
if I go back to it,

2090
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
we're not on TikTok

2091
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
to transform quickly,

2092
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
to get rid of it.

2093
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
According to my research

2094
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
it's a media

2095
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
that is

2096
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
trying to be

2097
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
as we are.

2098
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You can't fake it,

2099
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
you can back it.

2100
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
If we were on TikTok,

2101
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
yes, it's big,

2102
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
maybe we would have

2103
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
another audience,

2104
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
but maybe we would

2105
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
go with a partnership

2106
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
or a co-host

2107
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
or someone who lives

2108
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
on YouTube.

2109
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Your daughter

2110
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
starts using TikTok all the time.

2111
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Why would you do that?

2112
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I don't know.

2113
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
We've talked about it before.

2114
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Maybe.

2115
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I see people

2116
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
with this presence

2117
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
on all social media

2118
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
that go to YouTube

2119
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and can't find a home.

2120
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
At the beginning,

2121
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
you can't fill

2122
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
every profile,

2123
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
but you're there

2124
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
so you don't make

2125
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
any mistakes.

2126
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yes.

2127
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Maybe one more feedback.

2128
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
We haven't talked

2129
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
about it on record yet,

2130
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
but in the last three episodes

2131
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I'll put a link

2132
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
to the Discord.

2133
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's for

2134
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
older listeners

2135
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
IRC,

2136
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
and for younger listeners

2137
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Slack.

2138
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I try to encourage

2139
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
people to join the Discord.

2140
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
There are

2141
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
more than 100 people there.

2142
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
The debates

2143
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
are starting,

2144
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
people are trying to discuss,

2145
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
they are full-engaged,

2146
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
but I try

2147
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
to get people

2148
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
from all platforms,

2149
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

2150
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
to join the Discord

2151
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and have a channel

2152
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
where we can talk

2153
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
to listeners

2154
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
to get feedback

2155
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
and ideas for the future.

2156
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
There have been

2157
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
a lot of suggestions

2158
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
for topics.

2159
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I don't know why,

2160
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
but people would like

2161
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
to talk about

2162
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
full devices.

2163
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I'm always interested

2164
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
in private keys,

2165
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
asymmetric cryptography,

2166
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
cryptography.

2167
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
There are topics

2168
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
that people suggest

2169
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
because they would like to hear

2170
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
about them.

2171
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
We have to listen to them.

2172
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
There will be a balance

2173
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
between them.

2174
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Do you want

2175
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
to meet them?

2176
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
In a way, yes.

2177
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Do you feel like you have to

2178
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
meet them?

2179
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
No, but they get feedback.

2180
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I was wondering

2181
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
what do you think

2182
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
is the quality content

2183
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
that is missing?

2184
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I mean,

2185
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
maybe you get

2186
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
a good feedback

2187
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and then you filter it.

2188
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
You don't understand anything.

2189
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Something really good.

2190
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
For example,

2191
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Rod gave a great idea

2192
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
and then he wrote

2193
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
that it would be good

2194
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
if there was some preparation

2195
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
so that all the guests

2196
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
could get to know each other.

2197
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It's a bit contradictory

2198
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
with the NoScripted concept.

2199
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
For Marko,

2200
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
when we filmed him

2201
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it was a difficult topic.

2202
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It was a very broad topic

2203
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
and we prepared a lot

2204
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
and then the whole debate

2205
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
flowed more organically.

2206
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
We went into those things

2207
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that are really core

2208
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
debates, that are interesting

2209
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
and that we wanted to talk about.

2210
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
We didn't stick

2211
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
to the script,

2212
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
but it was a reward

2213
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
for the debates.

2214
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I really like

2215
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
that in the end

2216
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
the garden is like

2217
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
a pop-up restaurant.

2218
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It's still an experiment.

2219
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
We couldn't do it without preparation

2220
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
because we're not game developers.

2221
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Maybe Jan is closer

2222
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
to this topic than we are.

2223
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
To go back a bit,

2224
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I think the feedback is great.

2225
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Definitely.

2226
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
You look at the listeners

2227
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
and get that feedback.

2228
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
If I'm a person

2229
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
who's here

2230
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and I try to speed up

2231
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
things a bit,

2232
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
it's probably a grown-up thing.

2233
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Because I've spent

2234
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
so much time

2235
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
in the community

2236
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and I've grown a lot from it.

2237
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
If it wasn't for CyberPip,

2238
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
if it wasn't for organizing

2239
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
10 events,

2240
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
if it wasn't for the financial

2241
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and life risks

2242
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and all that stuff,

2243
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
for me it's the most important

2244
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
that you're okay.

2245
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I know it's a weird thing,

2246
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
but now that we're organizing

2247
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
events and I protect the volunteers

2248
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
who are the operators and I run them,

2249
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
they have to feel good,

2250
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
they have to be hydrated,

2251
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
they have to have something to eat.

2252
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That's the first thing.

2253
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And for all those

2254
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
expectations,

2255
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
we're still at the beginning.

2256
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
The world is globalized

2257
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
and the quality of the content

2258
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
is automatically higher.

2259
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
If someone does a static

2260
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
move to the side,

2261
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
it's not enough.

2262
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We can

2263
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
very quickly

2264
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
set expectations

2265
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
very high

2266
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and then implicitly

2267
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
the team feels

2268
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
obliged to keep them.

2269
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
That's my opinion.

2270
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Are we all okay?

2271
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Are we comfortable?

2272
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
When we

2273
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
adopt a new standard,

2274
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
it's like in the First World War.

2275
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You have an endless

2276
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
line of soldiers.

2277
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
It's not enough

2278
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
to keep

2279
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
that line of soldiers

2280
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
because it requires

2281
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
logistics,

2282
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
you have to be in that trench

2283
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
to get to the enemy base.

2284
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
It's not that trivial.

2285
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I don't know if that analogy fits.

2286
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Yes, it does.

2287
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's the same in the business world.

2288
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
We can talk about

2289
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
infrastructure as code,

2290
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
how great it is,

2291
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
the whole infrastructure.

2292
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
But if you don't have a single test

2293
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
written for your application,

2294
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
is it really meaningful?

2295
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We can put a camera here,

2296
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
record it,

2297
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
record what's happening with that camera

2298
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
that's shaking,

2299
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
and then we'll flatten it from the front,

2300
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
from the back,

2301
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
up and down.

2302
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
That standard is already set.

2303
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
The next standard is live stream.

2304
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
We won't have YouTube videos anymore.

2305
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
We've all learned that

2306
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
from CyberPip.

2307
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
The main catch is

2308
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
if you want to spend most of your

2309
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
creative time

2310
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
making content

2311
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
you need a session.

2312
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm not saying

2313
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
that we'll forever

2314
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
edit audio content,

2315
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
because we won't.

2316
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's drastically improved

2317
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
from episode zero.

2318
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
We didn't even know

2319
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
that episode zero would be released.

2320
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It's a brilliant idea.

2321
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The analogy would be

2322
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
if we go to a video,

2323
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
we won't be able to just

2324
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
go back to the audio.

2325
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
It would also affect you.

2326
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Especially you.

2327
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
When I talk to people

2328
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
before a video,

2329
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I get a lot of feedback

2330
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
like, yeah, give us a video,

2331
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
but how can you get

2332
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
better guests than you?

2333
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
AI will generate

2334
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
the characters,

2335
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
and you'll just

2336
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
have a voice-over.

2337
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
The first thing you see

2338
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
is that you're still drawing.

2339
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Imagine being able to

2340
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
publish that drawing.

2341
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
That's a lot of work.

2342
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
That's another criticism.

2343
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
We don't know what the guests

2344
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
look like.

2345
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You know how it looks

2346
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
on a PHP form.

2347
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
We don't know what the guests

2348
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
look like.

2349
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
That's interesting.

2350
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Now again, who wants

2351
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
to know?

2352
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Programmers really want to

2353
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
press the button when they see you on the street.

2354
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I think it makes more sense

2355
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
to link everything

2356
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
that has a guest.

2357
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
If it's aligned,

2358
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
if the pictures are there,

2359
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
then it's OK.

2360
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I don't know.

2361
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I'm a little biased

2362
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
when it comes to pictures,

2363
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
but on the other hand,

2364
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I'm really into GDPR.

2365
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Jan, maybe we should link TikTok?

2366
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Do you have TikTok?

2367
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I do, but I'm not active yet.

2368
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
That's the same thing.

2369
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I know how

2370
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
poorly I play social games.

2371
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I don't know.

2372
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
100 episodes will be different.

2373
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Now I'll share 100 episodes.

2374
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
It's a lot easier

2375
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
to link a website

2376
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
that I haven't done in two years.

2377
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
No pressure.

2378
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm talking to

2379
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Kovačevo Kobilo.

2380
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
He's the boss.

2381
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
We all have nice websites.

2382
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I talked to someone, I hope he's a guest.

2383
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
He has a website.

2384
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I wrote him that I wanted to see

2385
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
if he would be interested.

2386
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
He wrote,

2387
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I'm a virtuoso,

2388
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
but I'm not a guest.

2389
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I said, OK,

2390
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I'll promote you as a virtuoso.

2391
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
He said OK.

2392
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Kovačevo Kobilo.

2393
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I don't know.

2394
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
You have to have a presence.

2395
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Other people just don't know

2396
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
that you exist.

2397
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
OK.

2398
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
We talked to the audience,

2399
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
we got to know each other.

2400
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
When you publish

2401
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
the podcast,

2402
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
how does it look for you?

2403
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Do you have a website?

2404
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
No, he has 10 apps.

2405
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
How does it look?

2406
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Now we'll press

2407
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
the square

2408
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
where the recording will be.

2409
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It's nice if we record

2410
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
10-15 seconds at the end.

2411
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Then I upload

2412
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
to Google Cloud Storage

2413
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
or Dropbox

2414
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and send the link to Jan.

2415
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Jan has time

2416
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
to edit it.

2417
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
When I come back,

2418
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I'll talk

2419
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to the co-host

2420
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
or guest about the topic.

2421
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
The topic I publish

2422
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
is sometimes different

2423
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
than the topic

2424
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
we talk about daily.

2425
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Then I try to

2426
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
create a title.

2427
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Most of the

2428
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
big podcasts in Tuin

2429
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
and here

2430
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
have this format

2431
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
where the guest

2432
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
takes the title.

2433
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I try to extend

2434
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
the topic.

2435
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
The topic is more important

2436
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
than the guest

2437
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
because we don't want an interview.

2438
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
We create the topic

2439
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
and then I listen twice

2440
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
to the raw recording

2441
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
and try to come up

2442
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
with a copy.

2443
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Then I use the

2444
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
OpenAI tool

2445
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
for generating

2446
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
a picture.

2447
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Then I tell him

2448
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
some key words

2449
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and he generates a picture

2450
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
and I write the sentence.

2451
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Then I use

2452
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
a platform called

2453
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Encore FM

2454
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
for podcast distribution.

2455
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You upload

2456
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
the recording

2457
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and they have

2458
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
RSS.

2459
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
You upload

2460
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
the RSS to the podcast platform

2461
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
and then the podcast platform

2462
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
takes the RSS.

2463
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
No, you give them the RSS

2464
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and then they download it.

2465
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Encore FM

2466
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
is when you upload

2467
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
the recording

2468
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
and you can also add the voice.

2469
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
In the beginning,

2470
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
you can record the podcast directly

2471
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
on the platform.

2472
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
You can also add the intro, outro

2473
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
and teaser.

2474
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Then, when it's published,

2475
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
we release it

2476
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
via the platform

2477
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and schedule it.

2478
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Then I wait

2479
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
24 hours

2480
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
after the recording is uploaded

2481
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
to the podcast platform

2482
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
before I start the social push.

2483
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
The delay

2484
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
of 24 hours

2485
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
is to see

2486
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
how many people

2487
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
our core audience

2488
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
has

2489
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
before we publish it.

2490
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
To see

2491
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
the organic growth.

2492
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
After 24 hours,

2493
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I publish it

2494
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
on all social channels

2495
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and I ask

2496
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
the guests

2497
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
to publish it on their channels

2498
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
and to publish it

2499
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
among their companies

2500
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
so that they can hear it.

2501
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I also ask the guests

2502
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
to tell me

2503
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
that this content

2504
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
will be interesting

2505
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
for their companies

2506
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
for recruitment or whatever.

2507
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
So that they can try it

2508
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
and publish it themselves.

2509
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
How many hours

2510
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
does it take?

2511
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Have you ever thought about it?

2512
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
When I set it

2513
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
for 9

2514
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
hours, let's say 2

2515
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
to publish it.

2516
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I've heard a few comments

2517
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
asking if I need it.

2518
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I don't think so.

2519
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I don't get it.

2520
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
The hardest thing

2521
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
is when I listen to it

2522
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
for example

2523
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
when Ro sends it to me

2524
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I don't listen to it before

2525
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
but when he sends it back

2526
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I listen to it

2527
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
and I'm like fuck

2528
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I need to wait a week

2529
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
before I publish it.

2530
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
That's a sweet problem.

2531
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's much more than

2532
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
how many hours

2533
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
it takes to prepare it.

2534
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
You need to give feedback.

2535
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
People do it

2536
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
but I try to stick to a schedule.

2537
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
You recently said

2538
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
that we have a higher

2539
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
frequency of publishing.

2540
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's a good topic.

2541
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Have you ever thought

2542
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
about a buffer?

2543
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
To make it longer?

2544
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
When I talked to

2545
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
more professional Slovenian

2546
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
podcasters, journalists

2547
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
and experienced media people

2548
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
and so on

2549
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
they did it.

2550
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It's not possible.

2551
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I can't do it.

2552
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
You can't?

2553
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
No, because

2554
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I think it has to be

2555
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
organic.

2556
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
When we lack

2557
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
a few people

2558
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
and we start recording

2559
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
5-minute podcasts

2560
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
with an algorithm

2561
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I think it's bad.

2562
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I think you go back

2563
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
to those standard

2564
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
recording sessions.

2565
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
No, no.

2566
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Feedback is like that.

2567
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
You have people

2568
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
who don't listen to podcasts

2569
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
and they find it interesting

2570
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and start listening.

2571
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
They are not media people.

2572
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
They are introducers.

2573
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
When I talk to people

2574
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
who listen to us regularly

2575
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I save the last episode

2576
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
for when I go to Copera

2577
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
or Maribor

2578
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
and I'll have time to listen to it.

2579
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Then you have feedback like

2580
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
this podcast

2581
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
is so important

2582
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
for my industry

2583
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
so I save time

2584
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and actively listen to it.

2585
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Some people use it

2586
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
as background noise.

2587
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Let's jump a bit.

2588
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I think

2589
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
it's my version

2590
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
of using

2591
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
podcasts in general.

2592
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I need more time

2593
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
to listen to it

2594
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
once a week

2595
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
or 14 days more.

2596
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
You can't listen

2597
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
to 10 podcasts

2598
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
all the time.

2599
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I think

2600
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
it's better

2601
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
to have a break.

2602
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Not every two days.

2603
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
In Apple podcasts

2604
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
you can choose

2605
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
the frequencies.

2606
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I think I put

2607
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
every two weeks

2608
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
something like that.

2609
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Every two weeks

2610
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I don't work

2611
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
too much

2612
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
on what I have to do.

2613
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Now

2614
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Vaja's vlog

2615
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
as a co-host

2616
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
has nothing

2617
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
to do with it.

2618
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
It's a ping-pong.

2619
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
For Vaja

2620
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
you come

2621
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
for 4 weeks

2622
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
and for 5 weeks.

2623
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
So for Vaja it's even less.

2624
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I don't know how

2625
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
it will sound.

2626
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I don't know.

2627
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
It's an experiment.

2628
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
The frequency is very important.

2629
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
How long

2630
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
do you use it?

2631
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I don't know.

2632
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I can't imagine.

2633
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
To get a cover

2634
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
with 5000 views.

2635
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
It's a whole day.

2636
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
The first episodes

2637
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
that you sent me

2638
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
were rough,

2639
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
mp4 format.

2640
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
You didn't have a chance

2641
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
to create a lot

2642
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
because

2643
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
you can't.

2644
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
There's no information.

2645
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
There's no filters,

2646
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
no compressors.

2647
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
At that time

2648
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
it was like

2649
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
if you could

2650
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
repeat the episode

2651
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
you have to study

2652
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
where to cut.

2653
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Maybe I have more work

2654
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
with when to start the episode

2655
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
because you start

2656
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
talking

2657
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
and I listen

2658
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
the first 15 minutes

2659
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
just randomly.

2660
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Then I cut it.

2661
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Now that I have a stereo

2662
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I take more time.

2663
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I don't know.

2664
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
One and a half length

2665
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
of podcast.

2666
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
For sure.

2667
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Highly focused.

2668
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
You can be too old.

2669
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
The problem is

2670
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
that you can listen

2671
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
what you're doing.

2672
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
If I put one channel

2673
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
or whatever

2674
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
in the last episode

2675
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
it was a few seconds

2676
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
of pure silence

2677
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
or someone drank water

2678
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
etc.

2679
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
You cut it.

2680
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
You can listen later.

2681
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
It requires work.

2682
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
If I wanted

2683
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
to cut

2684
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
every episode

2685
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I would say

2686
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
in the same way

2687
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
If I wanted to cut

2688
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
it would be three times

2689
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
the length.

2690
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Maybe it's a bit

2691
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
exaggerated but

2692
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I think it's three times

2693
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
that it's meaningful

2694
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
to go back and forth.

2695
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And you, when you finish a track, do you listen to it one more time to get used to it?

2696
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Not entirely, not at this point, no.

2697
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Because at the moment, I'm more concerned with the technical aspects,

2698
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I don't have any personal preferences.

2699
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:33,000
But no, more like that, to check that the things you've created are there,

2700
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
that they're there, that they're not there.

2701
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You do it the opposite way.

2702
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Even if you imagine, I mean, 100 cuts is like that,

2703
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
or 100 keyframes there, it's fast.

2704
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I think now you can do everything by yourself, and it's fast.

2705
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
But it's probably the same for you, that you have a visualisation,

2706
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
that you see, I don't know, various...

2707
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I see some dots, in the waveform.

2708
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Various dots, and those highlights that you need to cut, and things like that.

2709
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You find a section that you want to divide, you listen to it,

2710
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
then you divide it, and then you listen to it,

2711
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
if it fits, and you get used to it, and that's it.

2712
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I could say that, in a way, when I scroll through the waveforms,

2713
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I have to listen to some parts, to see what it is,

2714
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I try some equalisers, and so on,

2715
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
so that I can get a hint of the colour of the recording.

2716
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
And in the end, I add some intro sound and outro sound,

2717
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
to a meaningful place.

2718
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And that's what I do, as I said,

2719
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
that the basics are based on the sound,

2720
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
and that's how it's done in the right way.

2721
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I still have a job, or I'm hiring someone, so...

2722
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
You still know how to talk.

2723
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Like the two of us, right?

2724
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Yes.

2725
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
For all those stories, it's like this,

2726
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
you have those active hours,

2727
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
when you can't do anything else,

2728
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
and then, how does it fit into your day,

2729
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I don't know if I'm saying it right.

2730
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
So, what I do is,

2731
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I collect all those correspondence with guests,

2732
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
or people on the topic,

2733
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I go through those emails twice,

2734
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
and then I think about it for about four hours,

2735
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
and then I quickly write it down on a piece of paper,

2736
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
so that I can remember some questions,

2737
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
that seemed meaningful to me.

2738
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And optionally, I do some background research on the guest,

2739
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
even though I don't know him that well.

2740
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
So, the active time before the podcast,

2741
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
it takes me about half an hour,

2742
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
but in reality, it's some kind of background,

2743
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
because I try to ask myself about those topics,

2744
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
what would be interesting for the guest.

2745
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So, yes, it's not exactly half an hour,

2746
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
but it would be hard if that day was, I don't know,

2747
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
because it's some kind of work,

2748
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
and you go from the inside of your day,

2749
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
it's not a problem, but if it's out of the ordinary,

2750
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
or if I'm stressed,

2751
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
then you can't think about it that day.

2752
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So, that's it.

2753
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I don't know if the listeners noticed,

2754
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
but when we have debates,

2755
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I try to be less of an active member.

2756
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
So, if you have three people,

2757
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
and it's a guest,

2758
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I try to be the secondary,

2759
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
or the moderator.

2760
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
You want to overstate this.

2761
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
No, no, no.

2762
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I try to listen.

2763
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I try to listen a lot,

2764
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
and I have interesting questions,

2765
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
or to change the topic,

2766
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
or to get out of the technical depths,

2767
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
and it gives me success.

2768
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
For example, when we were recording with Janko,

2769
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
when you go to Rebol,

2770
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
what am I supposed to do?

2771
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
You need to have self-defense for dancing,

2772
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
so you can jump high.

2773
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It's not necessarily bad.

2774
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
It doesn't mean that I want to do it synthetically,

2775
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
but I try to ask myself,

2776
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
okay,

2777
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
do we need to ask a question

2778
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
to make it easier for the beginners?

2779
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Because we've known each other for so long,

2780
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Oto, Andraž, and me,

2781
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
and Andraž,

2782
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
and we breathe technology in some way.

2783
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Sorry, yes.

2784
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I've known you for 15 years,

2785
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
and I was only 18.

2786
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
You're going to answer,

2787
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
or can I ask you a last question?

2788
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
No, no.

2789
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I can ask half a question,

2790
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
but I like that,

2791
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
because I know what it's like

2792
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
when you're flying,

2793
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
and you bring someone on a project

2794
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
and they do something similar.

2795
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I like that I don't have these tasks,

2796
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
so I look at myself

2797
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
and see how I suffer,

2798
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
but I see that this is the suffering

2799
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
that brings you joy and pleasure,

2800
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
and I know that's why you're doing it.

2801
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
As far as my effort is concerned,

2802
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I'm very similar to Andraž here.

2803
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I try to fit in

2804
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
what I need in my schedule.

2805
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I try not to go back

2806
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
to the scripted task,

2807
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
what I need to do,

2808
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
what I don't need to do,

2809
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
what I would like to ask,

2810
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
what I would like to talk about,

2811
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
what I would like to see.

2812
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I try to be not too scripted,

2813
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
and not too much research.

2814
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
We had guests

2815
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
that I was able to pick up

2816
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
from the side,

2817
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
because I came

2818
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
into the flow,

2819
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
but I try to pick up

2820
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
as much nature as possible.

2821
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
One last question.

2822
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
What will we conclude

2823
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
the first season with?

2824
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I don't know.

2825
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I've heard that here in the house

2826
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
you'll be doing a live stream.

2827
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I'll be doing a live stream.

2828
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
People will enjoy it.

2829
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Hostess, go-go girls, everything.

2830
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Hostess and hostess, both.

2831
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
What's the male form of hostess?

2832
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Hostess.

2833
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Hostess.

2834
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I think it would be pretty cool.

2835
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Let's do it.

2836
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
It's not a surprise.

2837
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I'm serious.

2838
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
It's a work in progress.

2839
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I'm talking about the house.

2840
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Andraž, Andraž, Jan,

2841
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
thank you very much

2842
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
for today's interview.

2843
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Thank you for inviting us

2844
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Thank you for giving us feedback.

2845
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Thank you for giving us the energy

2846
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
to work on it further.

2847
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Share it with your guests.

2848
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
And have a nice evening.

2849
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Bye.
