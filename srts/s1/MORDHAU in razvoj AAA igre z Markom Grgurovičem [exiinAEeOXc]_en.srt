1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How did you come up with the idea of creating a game developer and a gamer?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We both thought about game developers and gamers,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we came up with this mind map,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and we will try to follow this conversation.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
As I said, we are web developers with a web background,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
with Ops, Infra, and similar tasks.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
However, we came up with this idea to talk about game development.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We would like to find out what it means to make a real game today,

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
what are the challenges, what technologies do we use when developing games.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We are interested in what we don't know yet,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and what we need to know in order to make a proper game.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome to our podcast in Grodno.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Today, we have Andraž, Marko Grgurović,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
well, it's hard to say where we are right now.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Welcome, and could you please say hello to our listeners?

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you, thank you for the invitation and introduction.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm really looking forward to the debate.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Could you briefly tell us who you are,

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and how did you come to this industry?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why a game? Why not a computer system in DOS?

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And why did you drop to level 60?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's start with today.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
At the moment, I'm the director and founder of Triterion.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To be honest, I write too many codes.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I wouldn't dare, but that's the way it is.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It all started in 2014,

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
when I was just playing Mordhau.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Before that, I'll go back even further.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't work a lot in that scene.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was just playing.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My connection with game development started in...

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's say around 2000-2003,

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
when I was playing a really old MMORPG, Ultima Online.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But I was playing it on private servers,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
because I had my own emulator.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It was really well written,

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and there were a lot more codes than official ones.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So you could fully customize the emulator,

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and then buy new mechanics and stuff.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was completely different back then,

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
a completely new style, new mechanics.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've been playing Ultima Online for 10 years now.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
On and off.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sometimes I worked on it and wrote stuff,

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but that was it.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are we talking about modding?

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Almost, yes.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I understand correctly,

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
you had a client, and then you had a server site,

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and then the community reverse-engineered

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the protocol and made their own server site,

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and then you could modify it.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes, and the client was completely dumb.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You couldn't push the client,

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
because we didn't have that.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But the server had control over everything,

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
so you could almost start everything that way.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, and you were the first with the multiplayer.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It wasn't that detailed,

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
everything was in 2D.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I remember that.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But Ultima was a milestone in the gaming industry.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I recently heard that.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
People were crazy about hacking,

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and it was one of the most important features.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, I hear that.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hacker podcasts,

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
where people went in the dark direction of hacking,

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
everyone said that they hacked Ultima,

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
stole some coins, etc.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Games were crazy about mechanics.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You could sit in a bomb shelter,

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
pick up a Nugget,

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
find the hacker, kill him,

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
steal the whole bomb shelter,

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and sell it.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It was crazy.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It was so free,

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you could do whatever you wanted.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's not like that anymore.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's a nightmare.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
As far as the community is concerned,

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it's crazy how you manage it.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
People let it play,

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and there were safer options,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
like World of Warcraft,

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
where you couldn't build a bomb shelter.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You said that you played it,

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and that you hacked the server,

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
which you had access to.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I would like to know,

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
what were the game masters doing there?

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All the private servers were there.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You opened a note,

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
worked on it,

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
wrote some code,

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
it was C Sharp,

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think the emulator was called RunWall.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
How did you discover it?

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How did you discover those things?

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I wanted to play Ultima Online

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
many years before that.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I didn't have internet.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I went to the store,

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
took a box,

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and told my mom to buy it for me.

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She asked me if I had a mod,

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and I said no.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I was really sad.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I waited until I got the DSL.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then I downloaded it.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was in Chinese.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There was a torrent.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I downloaded it,

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and it was in Chinese.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I couldn't understand it.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then my colleagues and I

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
found out what it meant.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't know Chinese.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's like going to a modern washing machine,

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
looking at a symbol,

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and then you find out

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
what it means.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We started off well.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You still have your PhD from computer science.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't have it yet.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No?

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's another story.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's all about waiting.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OK, thank you.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But there's a way

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
from hacking Ultima servers

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to getting a PhD.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You went everywhere.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
A few things went differently.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I started doing this

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
as a hobby.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Then I started studying

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
for my PhD.

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I was really interested

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
in algorithms and such things.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I continued that

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
with the goal of starting

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
design, algorithms,

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
analysis,

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and science.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then I decided

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that maybe...

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It was quite late

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
when I started my PhD

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and I had a scholarship.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I decided

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that maybe

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
that's not where I should start.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The academic sphere

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
doesn't work the way

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you want it to.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You need to work on projects.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I decided

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
that maybe I should try

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and do it myself.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I've seen people do it.

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In Unity,

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
they have a 3D game,

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
but it's not that hard.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I know how to program,

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
so I'm going to try it.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's how it started.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
On January 1st, 2014.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You said you studied for many years.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I remember,

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
but I know it was January 1st.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I created a project.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's when people

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
were eating sour soup

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
with cat food.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's weird.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Maybe I don't remember January 1st.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You don't remember January 1st.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's a bit suspicious.

183
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You started with Unity.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean,

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have this feeling

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that proper game development

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
used to be

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Windows,

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
API,

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
C++.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You click and write.

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You write a text,

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and it starts.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I used to play a bit

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
long time ago.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think it was Object Pascal.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know why.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It was a bizarre language.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We had it in middle school.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Someone forced it.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I said, let's try it.

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But yeah,

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
most of the development

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
was done by yourself.

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You created your own engine.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
DirectX, OpenGL,

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
3D, 2D,

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
whatever.

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Without any libraries.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Minimal.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But now it's changed a lot.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Especially because

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the level

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
of what you need

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to include in the game

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
is much higher than it used to be.

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Expectations are higher.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In the past,

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
you could create

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
a simple 3D model

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and play a simple 3D animation.

222
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But now it's not enough.

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You need to have blending

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
between animations.

225
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You need to have

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
inverse kinematics,

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
so you can support

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
a visual style

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
other than 3D graphics.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Post-processing,

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and rendering

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
is much more complex

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
than it used to be.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's move on to

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the core,

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
where you started.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
When we talked

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
about gaming,

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and people helped us

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
prepare the agenda,

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Goran said that

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
he sees gaming

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
as the most complex

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
form of entertainment

245
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
we know today.

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Or art, in a way.

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Because

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
even movies

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
are a lie

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
compared to gaming.

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What do you think?

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How do you see it?

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes, definitely.

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The idea itself,

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and how you base it,

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
is that you are a gamer,

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and a gamer can destroy everything.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And a gamer wants to destroy everything.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So you do it

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
under pressure

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
so that

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
they will always need you.

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's not like a movie.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You shoot a movie,

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
watch it, and it will be like that.

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Maybe you have a different TV,

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
but it will be like that.

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A game that is made

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
has a million libraries.

270
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Today it works better,

271
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
but still,

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
if he comes, he will decide

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
how he wants to play,

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
he will have these controls,

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
he will have those controls.

276
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's the problem,

277
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and then the game itself.

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not like you imagined it,

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
but in a different way.

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It can be a better way,

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
but we have the same problem.

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How do they interact?

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's like a meta-game.

284
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
A meta-game.

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I think that people

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
take it for granted

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
that if you play hockey,

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
everyone has fingers,

289
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and then they shoot a goal.

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Because people see it as a game,

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and nobody pulls out a gun.

292
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If you talk about hockey,

293
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you are also young.

294
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You are already close.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I understand.

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You have to be technically

297
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
very capable

298
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to make your vision of the game

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
so that people don't take it for granted.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, it's very dangerous.

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think that's what's great

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
about AAA games.

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They are very careful

304
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that you can't do too much

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
as a player,

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that you are limited,

307
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that they have their vision,

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and that vision is the same.

309
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But here you also lose

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the indie scene,

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
which is very popular now.

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Demo-meta and sandbox.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Players can destroy everything,

314
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
destroy everything,

315
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
break everything,

316
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but they let it go.

317
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Players like it a lot

318
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
because you can make stories.

319
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
For example Minecraft.

320
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You can do whatever you want.

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's like Sol is creating

322
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
a world,

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
which is part of the game.

324
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sol is creating it.

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I have a lot of questions

326
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
about Mordhau,

327
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and then we will

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
get out of it

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
somehow,

330
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
if you know.

331
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's start first.

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Can you introduce

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
the game in your own way

334
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
so that I don't get nervous?

335
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mordhau is a multiplayer

336
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
fighting game.

337
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I mean,

338
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you actually fight

339
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
very close to each other.

340
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think they described it

341
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
in Joker.

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We were in the last issue.

343
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So yeah,

344
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
it's about

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
64 players

346
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
at the same time

347
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
on the same server.

348
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
One is bigger,

349
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the other is smaller.

350
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There are two team players,

351
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and you fight 32 against 32

352
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
in all possible ways,

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
it's very bloody.

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So yeah,

355
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
it's mostly

356
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
because

357
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
it's hard to describe

358
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
only the hit.

359
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You have to create a feeling

360
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
when you hit someone.

361
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's not that realistic.

362
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In the real world,

363
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
when you have a match,

364
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you don't have to beat the knight

365
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
with a shield.

366
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You just fight back.

367
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But without that,

368
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
it would be very flat.

369
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You wouldn't have that juicy feeling

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
when you hit someone.

371
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's one of the main features

372
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
when you hit someone.

373
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We spent a lot of time

374
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
on all those

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
parts,

376
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and sound.

377
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
For example,

378
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
in the movie,

379
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
you set up a scene

380
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and the knight will go down

381
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and you build up the sound

382
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
before the match even starts.

383
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's very important.

384
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
In the game, you don't know

385
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
that the knight will hit him

386
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
until he does.

387
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But in the real world,

388
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
you don't have to do that.

389
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
In the movie,

390
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
it's easier to do that.

391
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You have a juicy feeling

392
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and a good sound,

393
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but in the game,

394
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
it's more complicated.

395
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know if it happened,

396
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
but it's already known

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
if you want some kind of anticipation.

398
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We spent a lot of time

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
on sound, animations,

400
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
what happens when you

401
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
hit someone.

402
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's a first-person game,

403
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
so there's a third-person

404
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
view.

405
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But the main thing

406
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
is first-person, of course.

407
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We spent a lot of time on that.

408
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Then there's networking,

409
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
so it looks like it should.

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Then there's the effects,

411
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
what happens when you hit someone.

412
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's hidden in that location,

413
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
so the reaction

414
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
is exactly as it should be.

415
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's not necessary that it's an animation,

416
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
because in animations,

417
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
you have to understand

418
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
that animations are recorded

419
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and they always play the same.

420
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You can do some tricks,

421
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
but if you have a code

422
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
that drives that truck,

423
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it's quite something.

424
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We spent a lot of time

425
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
on that.

426
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's a competitive game.

427
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're a player against a player.

428
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's not a co-op game.

429
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're not fighting against each other.

430
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's like you're in two teams.

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's competitive.

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You probably won't attack

433
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
your opponent.

434
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You'd be surprised.

435
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You'd be surprised.

436
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You'd be surprised.

437
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We also have a co-op game

438
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
against AI.

439
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Together,

440
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you defend

441
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
a bot,

442
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and you get

443
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
waves.

444
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's interesting.

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's my style of play.

446
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You protect the table.

447
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think it's quite competitive.

448
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
When you're playing with friends,

449
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
you can't really decide

450
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
who's going to attack who.

451
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But if you attack AI,

452
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
it's easier to defend the bot.

453
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I wanted to ask if it's easier

454
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
to make a game where

455
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
people are fighting each other

456
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
versus AI,

457
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but it's probably

458
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
a different set of problems.

459
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes, it's a different way.

460
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a different challenge.

461
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes,

462
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
when it comes to game design,

463
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
when it comes to mechanics,

464
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
if you have a player versus a player,

465
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
you want both of them

466
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
to be happy with each other.

467
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So you don't want

468
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to overdo it.

469
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
For example, if one player

470
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
attacks the other,

471
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
those who will attack him

472
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
will feel bad.

473
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Those who manage to attack him

474
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
will feel bad.

475
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If you have AI,

476
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
it doesn't care what you do to it.

477
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You can mistreat it,

478
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
smash it, cut its head off,

479
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
let it bleed.

480
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The player isn't there,

481
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
so it's free.

482
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You can give the player

483
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
really good mechanics

484
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to make it feel like a total badass.

485
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
On the other hand, it's not a human.

486
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's completely different with PvP.

487
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So when you're playing

488
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
a player versus a player,

489
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
it's not too brutal

490
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
for the one who lost.

491
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, it's just a challenge.

492
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You can't overdo it.

493
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's really interesting.

494
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It reminds me of when you're a kid

495
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and someone older than you

496
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
is playing chess.

497
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You have to let go of the game,

498
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
so that the game is still meaningful.

499
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You don't ask questions,

500
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
you do a table flip.

501
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is the recorder.

502
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If you're a game designer,

503
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
it's even more complicated.

504
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You don't have the time

505
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
to let someone else win.

506
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can, of course,

507
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but you only have the time

508
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
that everyone else has.

509
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's not just about winning.

510
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's also about the feeling.

511
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Some mechanics feel great

512
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
for the player,

513
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
but not for the other player.

514
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's uncomfortable because

515
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you have to wait.

516
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's a catastrophe for the feeling.

517
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I read a book

518
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
called Deep Thinking

519
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
by Garry Kasparov,

520
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
a chess master

521
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
who played against

522
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Deep Blue from IBM.

523
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He was the first

524
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
professional chess player

525
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
to be beaten by an AI.

526
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He talked about

527
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the development of chess algorithms

528
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and how

529
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
brute force was

530
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
the first method

531
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and how they developed

532
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
more intelligent algorithms

533
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
for preparing

534
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
for the ideal position

535
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that the chess program

536
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
exceeds.

537
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
A big chapter in the book

538
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
is dedicated to

539
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the fact that they were prepared

540
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to make a full AI

541
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that would beat

542
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
a lot of people,

543
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and it was too good.

544
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It had to be smart enough

545
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
to still be interesting

546
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
for people

547
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
who were inexperienced

548
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
or beginners.

549
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It had to be useful

550
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
for learning and fun.

551
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Do you have a similar experience?

552
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
With first-person shooters,

553
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
the AI can always start

554
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
at 100 km.

555
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's a bit harder,

556
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
but not as hard as we made it.

557
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We could beat it,

558
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but then we did

559
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
things differently.

560
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
In the beginning,

561
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it could not defend itself

562
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
at the last moment.

563
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's not a good feeling.

564
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We had it,

565
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
but then we somehow

566
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
reduced it

567
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
so that it didn't have a good reaction.

568
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But I think

569
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
we could do it differently.

570
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We wouldn't look at it that way.

571
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know how much.

572
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
In our example,

573
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
when we were making a PvP game,

574
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the AI was added

575
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
so that we could test it

576
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
more than anyone else.

577
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So they use the same

578
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
methods as players.

579
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Everything is the same.

580
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They don't have anything different.

581
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Usually, in games,

582
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
it's changed a bit,

583
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
so they are more organized.

584
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
They have the same interface as players,

585
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
but we are moving the mouse.

586
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Do you have a problem

587
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
that players

588
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
golf in such a way

589
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
that they write their own?

590
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Not only that.

591
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
When we talked about Ultima,

592
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the gameplay was simpler.

593
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a 2D game.

594
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Here we talk about 3D,

595
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
moving, space, etc.

596
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
People are cheating.

597
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

598
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There are a few things

599
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
where cheating happens.

600
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We physically

601
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
work on the server.

602
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But we left certain things

603
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
to the client

604
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
because

605
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
it's too difficult

606
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
or impossible

607
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
to make it smooth

608
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
for everyone.

609
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
These corrections

610
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
can be really bad.

611
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So we left some things

612
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
to the client.

613
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We said that maybe

614
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
someone will exploit them

615
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and we will fix them.

616
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We left some of them.

617
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
At the beginning,

618
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
it's hard to read.

619
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They are full obvious.

620
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Those that are not so obvious

621
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
have some details.

622
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The problem is that

623
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
when you turn it around,

624
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
you control the attack.

625
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's the main feature.

626
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's not as easy to read

627
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
as in a shooter.

628
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Here it's not.

629
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's a very

630
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
difficult

631
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
concept.

632
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You have a parry.

633
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's a block.

634
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
When you activate it,

635
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it lasts 0.3 seconds.

636
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Then it goes down

637
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and you can't do anything.

638
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's an easy task.

639
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
When the attack starts,

640
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
it lasts 0.4 milliseconds.

641
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
When you just activate it

642
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
to see it.

643
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Then 0.4 milliseconds

644
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
or 0.5

645
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
when it moves through the game.

646
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But when it moves,

647
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
you can't move it.

648
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You catch the attack with the block

649
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and it moves away.

650
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's not as easy

651
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
to read.

652
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I understand.

653
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's another detail

654
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
how they move the attacks.

655
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It depends on the hitbox,

656
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
how the player looks,

657
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
what the animation is.

658
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's the exact last moment

659
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
when you get hit.

660
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't want to dwell on this topic, I'm interested in what's going on with the active search for cheaters.

661
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No, we don't have that many problems.

662
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No, we don't have that many problems.

663
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The problem is probably with those competitive players who play on private servers and then go around cheating.

664
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
For us, it's not a priority.

665
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The community is always happy, it's not the cheaters.

666
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yes, there are very few cheaters.

667
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
When we find them, it's obvious that we ban them.

668
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's move on to the next question.

669
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Why Mordhaud? Why knights? Why swords? Why the medieval theme? Why not in Vesolje?

670
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We started because we wanted to make a melee game.

671
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You have to be close to each other and fight each other.

672
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That was the starting point.

673
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
From that, we could go in any direction.

674
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The reason for the medieval theme was...

675
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
There were 9 of us.

676
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
9 people in the world?

677
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yes, and we were all divided around the world.

678
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We wanted to keep the organization, so we had to do it in a way that you just can't.

679
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
In the beginning, it would be possible, but we couldn't be more than that.

680
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We didn't have a team that would only deal with management or production.

681
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We all worked on something specific.

682
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So I tried to overshadow them, or put things in a way that would work.

683
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
The easy way to put together a 3D art is to focus on the medieval theme,

684
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because then you have the old pictures, manuscripts, references,

685
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and they all fit together.

686
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If you were working on a space game, and you told different artists to make their own,

687
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
they wouldn't fit together.

688
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Concept art is a lie.

689
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You don't need it at all. We didn't even have it.

690
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You just look at the books.

691
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Everything fits, everything is meaningful.

692
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The other thing is that it's still a style of play, because we know that medieval works,

693
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
but we haven't seen anything else like medieval.

694
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So from the market point of view, it would be too risky.

695
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
For us, medieval was cool.

696
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's cool, you have this, you have Kry, you have decapitations, and all that stuff.

697
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's cool.

698
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm wondering if we have to look at this podcast for ourselves,

699
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
for explicit content.

700
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We have to, right?

701
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't think so.

702
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We don't have anyone, so it's okay.

703
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let's talk about the main thing.

704
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Also, the standards for explicit are globalized, of course.

705
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yes.

706
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I mean, the market is absolutely clear for immersive personal games,

707
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
which are an action.

708
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
People are hyped up about different games.

709
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I mean, when I was researching this topic,

710
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you found a niche in games.

711
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
If I understand correctly, there were some other games,

712
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I don't know, you knew a lot about them,

713
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
that had a market, but hadn't been on the market for a long time.

714
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yes, Chivalry was in 2012.

715
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Or do you have more conferences today?

716
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes, Chivalry is now in development.

717
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The market is definitely small.

718
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's not as big as Shooter is.

719
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Everything is known, if there are two games on the market.

720
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Everything is known.

721
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I think that the market has also burst out of that bubble.

722
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I think it was at some point,

723
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
not just for a certain aspect of the player,

724
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
but I think people were like,

725
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
okay, I'm going to play this game with a colleague,

726
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
even though I'm not a big fan.

727
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
The launch was huge.

728
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I think we were the third on Twitch a couple of days ago.

729
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We were on top 7 on Steam for three weeks.

730
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think it was number one.

731
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It was huge.

732
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
All the streamers came up and played.

733
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
In general, it's also impressive how many people

734
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
got to know it and played it.

735
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's not as big as it was three years ago,

736
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
but it's a lot of people.

737
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I think Post Malone played at some point.

738
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
He's the Mountain of Game of Thrones streamer.

739
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What do you do to keep the player base?

740
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
How does it work?

741
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Our player base goes down over time.

742
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's hard to keep it.

743
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Especially here in the TV,

744
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
the game becomes harder over time.

745
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
People, because it's a PvP multiplayer,

746
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
get some strategies,

747
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
learn different animations,

748
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
more specific ones,

749
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
learn from other players,

750
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and change the way they play.

751
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Over time, it becomes harder and harder.

752
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What does it mean?

753
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That it's for beginners?

754
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It's completely different.

755
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Now we're trying to add some special strategies

756
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
for beginners,

757
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
but it's not a good solution for that problem.

758
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It happens with every game.

759
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's always happened so far.

760
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
In the beginning,

761
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
everyone came up and saw the Twitch streamer,

762
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
everyone was running,

763
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
no one knew what he was doing.

764
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's a different feeling.

765
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You're waving at someone,

766
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
they're laughing,

767
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
they want to defend themselves,

768
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
you hit them,

769
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
they're defending themselves.

770
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You don't have to do anything,

771
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
he's defending you,

772
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
you need a lot of time to hit him.

773
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's not the same feeling.

774
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's a bad position.

775
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you play a lot with on-boarding,

776
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
or with the first experience,

777
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
when I install a game,

778
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I start playing it,

779
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
the first feedback is probably very important.

780
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
People try to play it,

781
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and if they have a bad experience,

782
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
what happens next?

783
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's a refund.

784
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's a daily refund.

785
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think they have two hours,

786
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and then it's a refund.

787
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We've all dealt with it,

788
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
but it's very difficult

789
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
to solve it in post.

790
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
When you have a lot of players,

791
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
you have a community,

792
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
which is active,

793
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
but it's hard to grow again.

794
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Especially for PvP games,

795
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
it's hard,

796
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
for co-op it's easier,

797
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
because you add new content,

798
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and players come back and play.

799
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
We don't base it on

800
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
how long it will last,

801
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know for how long,

802
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
but I think it's important

803
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
to pivot to new projects.

804
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
We don't have a goal

805
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
to keep it at this level,

806
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
we will keep it,

807
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
but only for a while.

808
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You said before

809
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
that you tweaked

810
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
the servers,

811
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and it somehow

812
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
forced you into the game.

813
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
In this game,

814
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
there's a lot of weapons,

815
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and character building

816
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
is extremely important

817
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
for the player.

818
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Tell us more about it.

819
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I think we have

820
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
a thousand different

821
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
hair accessories.

822
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's huge.

823
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We overdid it a lot

824
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
with the customization,

825
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
you have the face sculpting,

826
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
to make your own face,

827
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't know why you do it in PvP,

828
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
but we added it.

829
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
For example, you can play

830
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
like a madman, I don't know why.

831
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Then we added

832
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
a lot of hair accessories,

833
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
you have gloves,

834
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
a hat, a frame,

835
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
a hat on the chest,

836
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
a hat on the head,

837
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
a hat on the neck.

838
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Is it based on reality?

839
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yes, there are hats,

840
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
some of them are made up,

841
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
but you can change them

842
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
independently.

843
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You can paint it,

844
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and it's like a Barbie

845
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
simulator.

846
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
The players have to do it,

847
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and a lot of it is...

848
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Some people come to the game

849
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to do the loadouts.

850
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So there's a lot of it.

851
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And then they buy...

852
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
We have

853
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
an in-game gold system,

854
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
you get it when you play.

855
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We didn't have a DLC

856
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
until late,

857
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and we started giving it

858
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
to raise the revenue.

859
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But most of it

860
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
is a game,

861
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
with time in the game.

862
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You get gold.

863
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Those DLCs are a way

864
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
for the community to support you

865
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
in the future, right?

866
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
To get more DLCs

867
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
for everyone who played

868
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Tetris recently.

869
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's actually

870
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
a new feature.

871
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
A new feature

872
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
for which you have to have

873
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
a basic game,

874
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
but it gives you

875
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
a new hat,

876
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and you get a hat

877
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and a sword for 5 euros.

878
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You can't get anything else.

879
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Some time ago,

880
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
World of Warcraft was

881
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
known for

882
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
building a character

883
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
from a level

884
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and then selling it.

885
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Do you also sell

886
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
folk characters?

887
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
No.

888
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
No, we don't.

889
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
In World of Warcraft,

890
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
it was a bit different.

891
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You made the character,

892
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and it became more powerful.

893
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We don't do that.

894
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
All the things you remove

895
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
are just cosmetic.

896
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You have a different hat,

897
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and you have 3 types of armor,

898
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
actually 4.

899
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Depending on the type,

900
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
light, medium, heavy,

901
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
it has certain

902
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
effects,

903
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
but it's fixed.

904
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Then you have a different

905
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
cosmetic look.

906
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It would be a nightmare

907
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
if you wanted to replace it.

908
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's too much.

909
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We have

910
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
4 different types of armor.

911
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The eyes are only on the head,

912
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
chest, and legs.

913
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Legs,

914
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
chest, and head

915
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
have different bonuses.

916
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Weapons have different bonuses.

917
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's too much.

918
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
When you talk about bonuses,

919
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
is it

920
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
an insight

921
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
as a developer,

922
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
or is it something

923
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
that people know?

924
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I mean...

925
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
They know...

926
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
They've been playing for a long time.

927
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They know,

928
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
because you have a tab

929
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
where you can see all the weapons.

930
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We went deep.

931
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I like it.

932
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
There are things

933
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I would never have thought about.

934
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Why this topic?

935
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Is it because you have

936
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
a concept art?

937
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Do you buy the sounds,

938
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
or do you record them yourself?

939
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
At the beginning,

940
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
before the release,

941
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I started working on the sounds.

942
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They were bought,

943
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
then replaced, cut,

944
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
as they had to be.

945
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It was...

946
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't do it anymore,

947
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
thank God,

948
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
but I'm still involved.

949
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Before that,

950
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I mean,

951
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
we didn't record the sounds.

952
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Except for the voices.

953
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You can choose the voices in the game.

954
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
We got

955
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
people who came

956
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
via e-mail and said

957
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
they would record something.

958
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I said OK.

959
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm an amateur.

960
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
They recorded it and it was cool.

961
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But it was so...

962
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
We didn't have

963
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
a good pipeline for it.

964
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Someone could call

965
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
or get to know someone

966
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
so we could do it.

967
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then I cut it a bit,

968
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
then they cut it a bit,

969
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
and then I did it in the game.

970
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Now it's done differently.

971
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We go through agencies,

972
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
they find people,

973
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
so we can do it.

974
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
How old were you? 9?

975
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
8? 9.

976
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That's impressive.

977
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You have your core team,

978
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
you make a game

979
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
which is a top

980
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
worldwide game.

981
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What does it look like?

982
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's like

983
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
you go to an island with a palm tree

984
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and take three things with you.

985
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
At first there were

986
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
more people.

987
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
How did you come up with it?

988
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
At first

989
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
it was more or less like

990
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
everyone lived at home.

991
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
In 2017 we had

992
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
a Kickstarter

993
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and we got 300,000.

994
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But it didn't go far

995
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
considering

996
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
that we could

997
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
reserve it for servers.

998
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Our team

999
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
consisted of

1000
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
two programmers.

1001
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
From artists

1002
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
there were

1003
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
four, I think,

1004
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and then

1005
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
two designers.

1006
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
One of them

1007
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
was a level designer,

1008
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
which means that

1009
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
the things the artists did

1010
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
were set in levels.

1011
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't know

1012
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
who else was there.

1013
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And the Kickstarter...

1014
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
One of the things

1015
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I really liked

1016
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
was the community.

1017
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Especially indie games

1018
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
have a big community.

1019
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
When they were preparing

1020
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
to make a game

1021
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
they already had a community.

1022
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And those developers

1023
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
that you mentioned,

1024
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
did they also come from the community?

1025
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yes, from the community

1026
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
of Chivalry.

1027
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Because we played there

1028
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and I met them there.

1029
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So they came

1030
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
from the team chat.

1031
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I haven't seen them

1032
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
since then.

1033
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I mean, I saw them later,

1034
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
but until then I didn't know them.

1035
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Some of them...

1036
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Chivalry also had

1037
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
what is happening now

1038
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
that they are sponsoring a modding contest.

1039
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And they have a prize,

1040
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
which means that

1041
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the best one is given in the game.

1042
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And it's a content

1043
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
for the player,

1044
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and it's a cash or recognition.

1045
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And some of our guys

1046
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
participated in it.

1047
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So we picked them up from there.

1048
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Some of them are with us.

1049
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
A few of them are with Diablo.

1050
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
When we posted

1051
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
there was a lot of filtering

1052
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
to find the right person.

1053
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Because working with a team

1054
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
that is not paid,

1055
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
is a completely different thing.

1056
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We had the luck to be nominated

1057
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
by the team in all 4, 3 years

1058
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
we worked with them.

1059
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
People could eat.

1060
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yes, but they were more or less...

1061
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
When you pick up these people,

1062
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
you have to be careful

1063
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that they are people

1064
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
who will live at home,

1065
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and they are young enough

1066
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and they won't cause problems.

1067
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And that's it.

1068
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That's a very simple description.

1069
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Every startup...

1070
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Only for beginners,

1071
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
if you want to play.

1072
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And of course,

1073
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the programmer has to be alone.

1074
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Because it's very hard for the programmer.

1075
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He will always get a job.

1076
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And those 3D artists,

1077
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
they are tired of it.

1078
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
No.

1079
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So,

1080
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
to make it better,

1081
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
this project was

1082
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
totally crazy,

1083
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
totally passionate,

1084
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
a lot of work,

1085
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
a lot of tape,

1086
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
space and water,

1087
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
cables.

1088
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So the medieval theme

1089
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
was not only in Art Direction,

1090
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
but also at home.

1091
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I wanted to ask you

1092
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
how is it to start

1093
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
today in the gaming industry,

1094
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
so that you can see

1095
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
what you want to do.

1096
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think you offered

1097
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
a lot of answers

1098
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
through the fact that

1099
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
modding is a very nice

1100
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
opportunity to start

1101
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
doing something.

1102
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
If you want to work

1103
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
in an indie scene,

1104
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
those who will be programmers

1105
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
will definitely have everything in their hands.

1106
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Because it's really hard

1107
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
to get programmers.

1108
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Even now, if you pay them,

1109
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
it's hard to get them.

1110
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Everything else can be found

1111
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
or solved.

1112
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You can do it

1113
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
and show it.

1114
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
For us it was

1115
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that when we started,

1116
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I already had something.

1117
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Something to show

1118
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
what you can do.

1119
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So the easiest way

1120
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
in the indie industry

1121
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
is to be a programmer,

1122
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
like everyone else.

1123
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That means

1124
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
that you are a master of language

1125
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and a master of some kind

1126
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
of environment.

1127
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yes, you learn

1128
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
how to do things

1129
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and don't worry

1130
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
about 3D animation

1131
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
or some kind of sound.

1132
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Because people

1133
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
who would only do that

1134
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
won't get it.

1135
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You will have, for example,

1136
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
three people in a team.

1137
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
One of them is a 3D artist,

1138
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
a programmer.

1139
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's not a space for someone

1140
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
who would deal with production

1141
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
or management.

1142
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
What does your compass

1143
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and your travel card mean?

1144
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
No,

1145
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I wanted to add one more thing.

1146
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I think that

1147
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
young people

1148
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
who play games

1149
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and maybe are interested

1150
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
in how games work

1151
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and want to enter

1152
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the industry,

1153
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
that community exists.

1154
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Indie game community.

1155
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's hard to say

1156
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
because I think

1157
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
it's an obstacle for young people

1158
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
because they don't know that.

1159
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But maybe they do.

1160
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What do you think about

1161
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
young people who want to

1162
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
enter the industry?

1163
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Is there a community

1164
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
where they can learn things

1165
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and people will help them

1166
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
to gain knowledge?

1167
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
If you are a young person

1168
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
in a certain area,

1169
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
you probably won't be able

1170
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
to talk to game developers

1171
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
every day.

1172
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
What I would suggest

1173
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
is that if you count

1174
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
in the industry,

1175
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
there is only one thing

1176
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
you need.

1177
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Everything you need.

1178
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Today it's a lie.

1179
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
If you download

1180
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Unreal or Unity,

1181
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
you don't need anything else.

1182
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
If that's not enough for you,

1183
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
then you are in the industry.

1184
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's very competitive

1185
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and it's hard to succeed.

1186
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You have to be better than

1187
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
everyone else.

1188
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
You will see it when you

1189
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
look for answers,

1190
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
but don't be that guy.

1191
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You have to invest

1192
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
some time in it.

1193
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Today it's a roadblock,

1194
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
but you persevere

1195
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and break through the wall.

1196
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
The filter is there

1197
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
for those who don't persevere.

1198
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
That's it.

1199
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Engines are available.

1200
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Everything is practically

1201
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
available.

1202
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You don't have to pay anything.

1203
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Unreal, for example,

1204
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
is free, but you pay

1205
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
5% or something.

1206
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Then you have Unity,

1207
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
which is free.

1208
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Let me add something.

1209
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Games,

1210
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
as you said,

1211
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
have extremely high

1212
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
expectations.

1213
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
If you are a programmer

1214
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and you start thinking

1215
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
about what you can do

1216
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
for a game,

1217
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
it can be overwhelming

1218
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and it will distract people.

1219
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
My question is

1220
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
how can

1221
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Hello World

1222
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
or Simple Game

1223
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
or...

1224
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
How in the world

1225
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
would you offer someone

1226
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
to make their own game

1227
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
that will be simple

1228
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and additionally

1229
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
give it to someone to play?

1230
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's a tricky question.

1231
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
As you said,

1232
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
if you think about

1233
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
what you will do

1234
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
when you see that

1235
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
it's 4 years, 5 years,

1236
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I don't know how long I will work.

1237
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Then you can't do it automatically.

1238
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It doesn't work that way.

1239
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You have to be

1240
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
naive,

1241
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
but you can't be

1242
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
too naive.

1243
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
If I take my example,

1244
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I think that every year

1245
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
from 2014 we will release

1246
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
the same game.

1247
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Absolutely no chance.

1248
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
If I knew I could do it

1249
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
in 5 years,

1250
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I would say no,

1251
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
thank you.

1252
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But I was naive enough

1253
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
to think that the game

1254
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
has changed.

1255
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
If you think about it,

1256
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
it's still one year.

1257
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But because of that

1258
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I persisted.

1259
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
You have to be naive

1260
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
a little bit.

1261
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
If you are too naive,

1262
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you have other extremes.

1263
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
For example,

1264
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I will make an MMO,

1265
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
World of Warcraft 2,

1266
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
we are 3 and that's it.

1267
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It doesn't help you at all.

1268
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
You conclude that Facebook

1269
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
doesn't exist.

1270
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We have 3 people in 2 years.

1271
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You have to be

1272
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
naive, but not too naive.

1273
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Is that naivety?

1274
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't know.

1275
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't know which one.

1276
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
At some point you learn

1277
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
that you were naive,

1278
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and then you grow up.

1279
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
If I draw a parallel

1280
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
to

1281
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
web development,

1282
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
web development is

1283
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
so successful

1284
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
because if I want

1285
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
a different experience,

1286
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I upload a new file

1287
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and the experience for all users is new.

1288
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
If I make a mobile app,

1289
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
which I can upload to

1290
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
iStore,

1291
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
there will be a review process,

1292
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and it will take 5 hours.

1293
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
With gaming,

1294
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
things have to be more

1295
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
polished,

1296
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
more stable.

1297
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You can also

1298
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
look for

1299
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
perfectionism.

1300
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Do you have to be a perfectionist?

1301
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Can't you be one?

1302
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yes.

1303
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's related to

1304
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
the question

1305
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that was asked

1306
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
before,

1307
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
that games are complicated

1308
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and it's hard to succeed.

1309
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
The market exists for all types of games,

1310
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
even for those

1311
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
that are not so sophisticated.

1312
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,720
They are also among those who are very successful.

1313
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
They are simple, 2D.

1314
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,040
The only difference is how many people create them.

1315
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,240
Because they are easier, and people are much easier to catch up with.

1316
00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:20,639
Subsequently, there are more games like that, and it's harder to succeed.

1317
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:27,280
The more you complicate a thing, the more you complete it, the more you finish it, the more time you need,

1318
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,600
the fewer people who succeed in it.

1319
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,279
This means that there are fewer other developers, which means that you are more likely to succeed.

1320
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:38,959
So in the end, you also have a mistake on those that are really AAA,

1321
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:42,400
but then you use so much cash for it that it's a bit pointless.

1322
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:50,880
There is a sweet spot, where there is not a lot of noise in the store itself, in the products that come out,

1323
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,520
but at the same time they don't use too many people, or too few.

1324
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,160
So it depends a lot on where you are going with it.

1325
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,559
But there are a lot of very simple games, and even if it's a great game,

1326
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,000
you can simply lose some noise and not sell anything.

1327
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,279
But probably if you are a beginner, all this experience,

1328
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:20,160
look, this game you made for me, it's on the market, I went through the whole process once.

1329
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,760
Sure, no, this is now...

1330
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,800
You should try to find people who are interested in this topic, right?

1331
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,040
No, it's for sure, but don't make simple games.

1332
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,800
Because if you want to make them, you're right,

1333
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,080
but with that you won't get any useful knowledge,

1334
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:44,800
look at how 3D animations work, how do I put it together, what is the workflow for that.

1335
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,760
Completely different techniques are used.

1336
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,040
I mean, there are basics that you can use, of course,

1337
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,199
you know how the engine works, you know how to put it on a store,

1338
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:55,519
what is a store integration, or something like that,

1339
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,480
or simple things, but it's a completely, completely, completely different thing.

1340
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,440
The details that you have to deal with, and also the changes,

1341
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,360
the very architecture of the game, how it's based,

1342
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,360
what you have to deal with, and so on.

1343
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,119
I've learned that you often do difficult things,

1344
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,199
so let's go back to the doctorate.

1345
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,880
What is your doctorate?

1346
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,000
It's in theoretical computing, algorithmic graph theory.

1347
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,960
In fact, they are the fastest algorithms for...

1348
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
especially for the best graphs.

1349
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
It's a classic problem,

1350
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,080
I've tried to run faster times in theory,

1351
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,080
and sometimes also in practice.

1352
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:43,039
Okay, nice.

1353
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,759
I recently talked to a guy who worked for Neo4j,

1354
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:51,119
he worked in the company Neo4j, for Neo4j,

1355
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,960
it's the most popular commercial offering for a graph base,

1356
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,240
and we quickly agreed that even he who works in Neo4j

1357
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,360
actually doesn't work in X-graphs,

1358
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,360
that they are fully...

1359
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,039
in our part of the industry, they are known as taxilor bullets,

1360
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,679
but everyone wanted to work with graphs,

1361
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,360
but in reality, those traditional bases are still

1362
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,360
quite optimized and good enough

1363
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:24,320
that most of the use cases are covered by those intermediate graphs.

1364
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,320
Is that related to Moorhound?

1365
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
No, it's completely unrelated,

1366
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,320
it's purely an academic thing,

1367
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
nothing to do with the industry,

1368
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
very little practical.

1369
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,320
Now, we're going to try this podcast,

1370
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
even more technically now,

1371
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,360
and this technical core is probably,

1372
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,360
if I'm right,

1373
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,320
the core of your game engine.

1374
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,320
I'm going to try to ask you a question now.

1375
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
So if you could just explain to us,

1376
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,320
did you first start making your own game engine?

1377
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
No.

1378
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
We're in Unity.

1379
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,320
So you started with Unity,

1380
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
and then you went to Unreal Engine,

1381
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,320
if I'm right, you now have Unreal Engine 4.

1382
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
Yes, and we're working on it again.

1383
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
Can you now explain

1384
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
what your game engine is,

1385
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,320
and what is the core of that game engine,

1386
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
and what's inside it, for example?

1387
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Yes, it's different,

1388
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
but at the beginning,

1389
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
the expectation is that your game engine

1390
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,320
is something that all games would need.

1391
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
So you don't need to mess with it.

1392
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
If you have an operating system,

1393
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
you can't write it,

1394
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
you can only write applications.

1395
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,320
So ideally, we would work on games,

1396
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
and not mess with banal things

1397
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
that are not really important.

1398
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
Things like, let's say,

1399
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
mind tooling,

1400
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
like, for example,

1401
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
sound support,

1402
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320
so you don't have to mess with it.

1403
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
So your rendering works,

1404
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
so the renderer is set up,

1405
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320
so you can import models, animations,

1406
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
and then solve them.

1407
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
But those are very simple things.

1408
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
Nowadays, engines are much more advanced than that,

1409
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
and they also enable you

1410
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
to have a sound system

1411
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
that is more complete,

1412
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
so you can, for example,

1413
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,320
edit and paste together

1414
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
various sounds into larger constructs,

1415
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
so you can import animations,

1416
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
and the code and the handling

1417
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
is quite open,

1418
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
so you can work on your own features in the engine.

1419
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
In fact,

1420
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
networking is also possible.

1421
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
Now, different engines

1422
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
offer different things.

1423
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
Some,

1424
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
maybe not as much as some others,

1425
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
are competing with each other.

1426
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
The main two are for

1427
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
anything

1428
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
bigger than 2D,

1429
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,320
Unreal and Unity.

1430
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
However,

1431
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
Unity is...

1432
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
I don't have

1433
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
the best opinion about Unity

1434
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
nowadays.

1435
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
It's really cute as an engine.

1436
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
I don't know if I'm going too far.

1437
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
No, we're going even deeper.

1438
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
Unity is a very nice tool.

1439
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,320
It's very nice to work with it,

1440
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320
unless you're doing something serious.

1441
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
Then you realize

1442
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320
that it's a disaster.

1443
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,320
It's a disaster

1444
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,320
because

1445
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,320
the problem is Unity,

1446
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,320
what they do and what they focus on.

1447
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
The engine has a lot of features

1448
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
that are so outdated

1449
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,320
that they're completely useless.

1450
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
People do their own networking

1451
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,320
inside the engine,

1452
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,320
which is unacceptable.

1453
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
I mean, you can do it,

1454
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
but why?

1455
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
Then there are various optimizations

1456
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
for rendering,

1457
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,320
which have a lot of plugins.

1458
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,320
People trust the plugin

1459
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,320
and use it,

1460
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
but it's very dangerous.

1461
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320
You're dependent on a plugin

1462
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
that some guy

1463
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
made at home,

1464
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
and now he decides

1465
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
to go to the office

1466
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,320
and get a job there.

1467
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,320
It's not supported anymore,

1468
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
but you're based on it.

1469
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
You're going to ship it.

1470
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
I don't think so.

1471
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,320
I don't know

1472
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,320
what code he used.

1473
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
We were very worried about that

1474
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,320
and we had a lot of problems

1475
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
in Unity because there were

1476
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
a lot of things to do.

1477
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,320
We had our own networking,

1478
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
but in reality

1479
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
there are very few things done.

1480
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
But Unity was the only option in 2014.

1481
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,320
Unreal was easy

1482
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,320
when it came in the preview,

1483
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,320
and then it was released,

1484
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
but you don't want to

1485
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,320
do something new.

1486
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,320
Don't touch it.

1487
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,320
Don't touch it for another year

1488
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,320
because it's not good.

1489
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,320
They say it's good,

1490
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,320
but it's not.

1491
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,320
Unreal was a god

1492
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,320
when it started.

1493
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,320
There was no Marketplace

1494
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
and I worked alone,

1495
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,320
so I chose the Marketplace

1496
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,320
from Unity.

1497
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,320
Now Unreal is also there.

1498
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,320
Did you start with Unity

1499
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
when you said it wouldn't work?

1500
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Yes, a year and a half ago.

1501
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
You started a year and a half ago

1502
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,320
with a new engine.

1503
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
Did you move assets?

1504
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
What did you do?

1505
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
We moved some things,

1506
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
but very few.

1507
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,320
Maybe Unity

1508
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,320
is easier to start with

1509
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,320
and then when you do

1510
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,320
more complex things

1511
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,320
or risk management

1512
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
when you manage some risks.

1513
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,320
Unity is a very nice start.

1514
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,320
I mean, I enjoyed

1515
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
when I worked a lot

1516
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,320
and then you do something

1517
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,320
and everything works

1518
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,320
and it was cool.

1519
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,320
It doesn't have many features,

1520
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,320
but it also forces you

1521
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,320
to do your own thing,

1522
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,320
which is also OK.

1523
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320
The problem is that it offers

1524
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,320
very little when it comes

1525
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,320
to architecture,

1526
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,320
which allows you to do

1527
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,320
whatever you want.

1528
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
Nothing will force you,

1529
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,320
everything is OK,

1530
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
but nothing is really

1531
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,320
well supported.

1532
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
I like it so much

1533
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
that you can program

1534
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,320
so vertically.

1535
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,320
I only hear React vs.

1536
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,320
Angular.

1537
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,320
For example,

1538
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,320
Flask is very popular

1539
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,320
and when you click

1540
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,320
Hello World,

1541
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
it works.

1542
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,320
I have a favorite framework

1543
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
where you can write

1544
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
one .ini file,

1545
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,320
then the same thing,

1546
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,320
then the third thing,

1547
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,320
and then when you go

1548
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,320
to a commercial product

1549
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,320
in a year and a half,

1550
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,320
you say,

1551
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,320
now I understand

1552
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,320
why you need to

1553
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,320
do a lot of things.

1554
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
When I have eight people

1555
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,320
in three years,

1556
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
I understand

1557
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,320
that these things

1558
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
are still meaningful.

1559
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,320
Unreal Engine 4,

1560
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,320
you said,

1561
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,320
is this part

1562
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,320
open source?

1563
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,320
This is a very important thing

1564
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,320
in Unity.

1565
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
Unity is closed source,

1566
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,320
and usually with those

1567
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,320
that are open source,

1568
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
you don't want to see the source.

1569
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,320
That's terrible.

1570
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,320
Crytek leaked,

1571
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
CryEngine leaked

1572
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
some time ago,

1573
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
and it's incredible what's there.

1574
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,320
You close it, and bye.

1575
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,320
No chance.

1576
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,320
You can't find anything there.

1577
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
On the other hand,

1578
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,320
Unreal is open source,

1579
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,320
and it's very important

1580
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,320
because in Unity,

1581
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,320
you don't know what you're doing.

1582
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
If I'm interested,

1583
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,320
if I have a specific game

1584
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,320
that requires me to know

1585
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
how much input latency there is,

1586
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,320
where the input is,

1587
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,320
does the input change at the beginning

1588
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,320
of the frame,

1589
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,320
does it change at the end of the frame?

1590
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,320
A game renders each frame individually,

1591
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
and it lasts 16 milliseconds.

1592
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,320
Input latency can be 16 milliseconds,

1593
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,320
it can be 30 milliseconds,

1594
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,320
but it's very important,

1595
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,320
and it's a black box.

1596
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
That's a big problem in Unity.

1597
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
You can't even,

1598
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,320
for example,

1599
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
it's important that you have

1600
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
access to low-level C++ stuff.

1601
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,320
Unity is written in C++,

1602
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,320
but you work in C sharp.

1603
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,320
And it's all known.

1604
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,320
I mean, you don't have to

1605
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,320
work on the whole game in C++,

1606
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,320
but I'd like to have

1607
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,320
things like that, maybe.

1608
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,320
Unlike that,

1609
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,320
Unreal is a pure open source,

1610
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,320
and it's a lab source.

1611
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
Everyone chooses it,

1612
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,320
everyone edits it.

1613
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,320
Of course, then Epic decides

1614
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,320
if they're going to put something in there.

1615
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
But it's also huge.

1616
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,320
Unreal is huge.

1617
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,320
Unity is a fly against Unreal.

1618
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,320
Unreal has so many things

1619
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,320
that you don't even know

1620
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,320
what's going on after five years.

1621
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
And it's very strict

1622
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
on a lot of things.

1623
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
There's a specific framework

1624
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320
that you have to follow.

1625
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
If you want to go beyond that,

1626
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,320
it won't work.

1627
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,320
I mean, you can do it,

1628
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,320
but why? Go to Unity and work there.

1629
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,320
When I went to Unreal,

1630
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,320
I had a lot of good practices,

1631
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,320
and I went to work in Unity

1632
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,320
on similar things.

1633
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
And I realized,

1634
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,320
why do I work in Unity

1635
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,320
if they have it done

1636
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,320
and you can see

1637
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,320
that it's much easier to do it.

1638
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,320
But if the framework is so big,

1639
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,320
doesn't it happen to you

1640
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,320
that you might start

1641
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,320
reinventing something

1642
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,320
because you don't know

1643
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,320
what's going on?

1644
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,320
It happens a lot,

1645
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,320
and it's a lot of work.

1646
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,320
You can't allow that.

1647
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,320
Even in our programmers,

1648
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,320
if I see that they do something

1649
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,320
on their own,

1650
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
I have to go to GitHub

1651
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,320
and take a source file every day.

1652
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,320
Because the documentation in Unity

1653
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,320
is the only documentation.

1654
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
Everything else is outdated.

1655
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,320
You have to take the source,

1656
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,320
you have to go through

1657
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,320
how it works,

1658
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,320
but you can see everything.

1659
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
You can see exactly how the networking

1660
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,320
works, exactly how the input works.

1661
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,320
There's no debate.

1662
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
That's the only documentation

1663
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,320
that really exists.

1664
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
The difference is that

1665
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,320
Epic, which makes Unreal,

1666
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,320
ships games with it.

1667
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,320
Unity didn't ship anything.

1668
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,320
There are very few games

1669
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,320
in Unity at that level.

1670
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,320
Usually 2D or mobile games

1671
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,320
are huge there,

1672
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,320
but at that level

1673
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,320
there are very few releases.

1674
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,320
In some sources,

1675
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
Unreal was an option the day before.

1676
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,320
But Unreal,

1677
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,320
Fortnite, all those things,

1678
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,320
all the good practices

1679
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,320
that they did there,

1680
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,320
they did in Unreal Engine.

1681
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,320
Especially with more

1682
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,320
gameplay-oriented things.

1683
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,320
For example, the framework of the game itself.

1684
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,320
What's the difference between

1685
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,320
when you're not a player?

1686
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,320
Are you a player now?

1687
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,320
Is it just your character,

1688
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
or is it another controller

1689
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,320
that controls that character?

1690
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,320
Unity doesn't have any of those concepts.

1691
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,320
Unreal has already defined it all.

1692
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,320
It's just that

1693
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,320
it's a real demo of the engine.

1694
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,320
It's more of a philosophy.

1695
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,320
They have

1696
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,320
this beautiful practice

1697
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,320
where

1698
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
for every engine,

1699
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,320
for 4 and 5,

1700
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
they make a reference project.

1701
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
That project has its own team.

1702
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
They update that project

1703
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,320
for every engine update.

1704
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,320
They update it.

1705
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,320
If a new system is updated,

1706
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,320
they update it.

1707
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,320
They show you all the good practices

1708
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,320
for the whole project.

1709
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,320
Are those games also open-sourced?

1710
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,320
Yes, they're all open-sourced.

1711
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,320
They promote

1712
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,320
that a good way to start

1713
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,320
is to start with your template

1714
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,320
and then build on it.

1715
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,320
You wouldn't choose

1716
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,320
a goat and drag it out of the thing.

1717
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,320
I have three questions for you.

1718
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,320
Is it more like open-source?

1719
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,320
Come on.

1720
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,320
You're not a believer

1721
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,320
in open-source.

1722
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,320
I'm not asking you to

1723
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
take it and recompile it.

1724
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,320
That's a different question.

1725
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
We're not going to

1726
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
guest-stroll it.

1727
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,320
SDK is available.

1728
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,320
It's not open-source.

1729
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,320
It's just visual scripting.

1730
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
Unreal Engine, Epic Games,

1731
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,320
and Team Sweeney.

1732
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,320
Can you explain

1733
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,320
the philosophy

1734
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
of Epic Games?

1735
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
Why is Unreal Engine open-source?

1736
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,320
What's the vision

1737
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,320
of Epic Games?

1738
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,320
Epic Games

1739
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
is one of those

1740
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,320
technology companies

1741
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
that has been preparing for

1742
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
what Facebook started calling

1743
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,320
Metaverse.

1744
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,320
Immersive experiences

1745
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,320
and so on.

1746
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,320
Facebook, Google, and similar

1747
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
players started talking about it.

1748
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,320
Epic Games is a technology company

1749
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,320
that has been investing

1750
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,320
in technology for 30 years.

1751
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,320
They didn't know

1752
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,320
they were doing it.

1753
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,320
How did Epic Games

1754
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,320
get involved?

1755
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,320
They started with Unreal Tournament.

1756
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,319
They were like Quake.

1757
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,319
They were arena shooters.

1758
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,319
They brought that engine

1759
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,319
and somehow

1760
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,319
they were the only ones left.

1761
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,319
Why is it open-source?

1762
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,319
Everything is open-source.

1763
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,319
Every engine is open-source.

1764
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,319
To be honest,

1765
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,319
you don't get

1766
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,319
anything

1767
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,319
if it's closed-source.

1768
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,319
Only if it's unbreakable.

1769
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,319
Most examples are.

1770
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,319
Nothing helps if it's open-source.

1771
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,319
It can have a third party behind it.

1772
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,319
Everything has an Epic.

1773
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,319
If it doesn't, it's not open-source.

1774
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,319
I don't know why

1775
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,319
others hide open-source.

1776
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,319
I don't think it's on their level.

1777
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,319
Epic Games doesn't have

1778
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,319
any problems with it.

1779
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,319
They take away 5%

1780
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,319
from the release.

1781
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,319
It's OK for them

1782
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,319
because huge studios use it.

1783
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,319
For example, CD Projekt

1784
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,319
that has Witcher and so on.

1785
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,319
They switched to Unreal.

1786
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,319
It's full of that.

1787
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,319
They can live

1788
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,319
in Fortnite.

1789
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,319
I'm a cash printer.

1790
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,319
Is the ecosystem

1791
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,319
Fortnite,

1792
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,319
Engine, Store,

1793
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,319
Launcher,

1794
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,319
and Publishers

1795
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,319
in general?

1796
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,319
Publishers

1797
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,319
aren't at the top.

1798
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,319
Everyone can publish now.

1799
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,319
It's not about that anymore.

1800
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,319
But

1801
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,319
in the beginning

1802
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,319
they started with Unreal

1803
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,319
until Fortnite came out.

1804
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,319
They always worked against each other.

1805
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,319
They had an engine team

1806
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,319
and teams that worked on games.

1807
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,319
Those teams

1808
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,319
talked to the engine team

1809
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,319
and the engine was updated.

1810
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:52,319
They had

1811
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,319
some kind of a flop.

1812
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,319
They released Paragon

1813
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,319
which was a mobile game.

1814
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,319
Fortnite was

1815
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,319
a survival game

1816
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,319
that could

1817
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,319
be a flop.

1818
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,319
Then they changed it

1819
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,319
to a real game

1820
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,319
and there was a lot of cash.

1821
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,319
What happened next?

1822
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,319
Unreal was already

1823
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,319
5% free.

1824
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,319
It had nothing to do with that.

1825
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,319
Then they started

1826
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,319
with the Fortnite cash store.

1827
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,319
With that store

1828
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,319
they tried to compete

1829
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,319
against Steam.

1830
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,319
There were less players

1831
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,319
and less sales.

1832
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,319
But they financed them

1833
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,319
by buying the games

1834
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,319
for some time.

1835
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,319
If I understand correctly

1836
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,319
the royalty you pay

1837
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,319
is lower, right?

1838
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,319
Yes, the royalty is lower.

1839
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,319
It has nothing to do with that, right?

1840
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,319
It does, but

1841
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,319
the sales are so low...

1842
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:56,319
Wait, did Epic Games

1843
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:58,319
have

1844
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,319
a dispute with Apple Store

1845
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:02,319
because of some...

1846
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:04,319
If I understand correctly

1847
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:06,319
why

1848
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:08,319
did they go there?

1849
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:10,319
Yes...

1850
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:12,319
I think it's important for the industry.

1851
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:14,319
Yes, they go there

1852
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:16,319
to try to pay

1853
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,319
those 30%.

1854
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:20,319
But that's half of it.

1855
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:22,319
It's a big problem because

1856
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,319
Steam has those 30%.

1857
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:26,319
They don't do anything anymore.

1858
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,319
They are a cash printer.

1859
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:30,319
That's it.

1860
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:32,319
You can't

1861
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:34,319
go beyond that.

1862
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:36,319
They try from Epic Store

1863
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,319
and lower everything.

1864
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:40,319
It's so ingrained

1865
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,319
that you can't get inside

1866
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:44,319
if they make everything accessible.

1867
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,319
Why go to mobile?

1868
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:48,319
Because you have no options.

1869
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,319
It's terrible to force yourself

1870
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:52,319
to pay 30%.

1871
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,319
On the other hand

1872
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:56,319
you have a lot of games.

1873
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:58,319
They don't want 30%.

1874
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:00,319
They want 30% of the things

1875
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:02,319
you buy inside the game.

1876
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:04,319
If I make a store in a store

1877
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:06,319
they will get 30%,

1878
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:08,319
I will get 30% and they won't get anything.

1879
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:10,319
I don't know where you're going.

1880
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:12,319
The difference, in my opinion,

1881
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:14,319
why

1882
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,319
would I focus so much

1883
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:18,319
on that if I was

1884
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:20,319
in their position?

1885
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,319
If you want to have a game

1886
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,319
that is more like a metaverse,

1887
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:26,319
that you can

1888
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:28,319
have a note in yourself

1889
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:30,319
made by a player.

1890
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,319
The only way to make a good note

1891
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:34,319
is if they are paid for it.

1892
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:36,319
And if players buy it.

1893
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:38,319
But if you have that

1894
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:40,319
and the store gets the percentage

1895
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:42,319
and you get the percentage

1896
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:44,319
and they get their share

1897
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:46,319
it can't work.

1898
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:48,319
Until you destroy the store

1899
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:50,319
then anyone can survive

1900
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:52,319
It's very difficult.

1901
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,319
Facebook succeeded

1902
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:56,319
on the quest.

1903
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:58,319
The same store dominates.

1904
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:00,319
The numbers are

1905
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:02,319
abnormal compared to Steam.

1906
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:04,319
So yeah,

1907
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,319
that's the main problem for them.

1908
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:08,319
It's even better

1909
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:10,319
if they don't have to pay.

1910
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:12,319
But

1911
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:14,319
if they don't...

1912
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:16,319
I understand, thank you for telling us

1913
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:18,319
but I will go back

1914
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:20,319
to the engine.

1915
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:22,319
If Unreal Engine

1916
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:24,319
didn't exist

1917
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,319
then Unity

1918
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:28,319
would be the only option

1919
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,319
to write

1920
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:32,319
the specs for the engine.

1921
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:34,319
No, it depends on what.

1922
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:36,319
For some 3D stuff.

1923
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:38,319
Unity, I mean CryEngine

1924
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:40,319
still exists but

1925
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,319
I don't know, it's a tricky situation.

1926
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:44,319
Nobody uses it.

1927
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:46,319
The only ones that use it

1928
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:48,319
are Crytek.

1929
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:50,319
Very few people use it.

1930
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:52,319
I haven't

1931
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:54,319
looked into it.

1932
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:56,319
What would be the other option

1933
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,319
if it wasn't for Unreal, Unity

1934
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:00,319
or CryEngine?

1935
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:02,319
I've heard about an engine called Godot.

1936
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,319
Yeah, I haven't heard about it.

1937
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:06,319
It's a new open source engine.

1938
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:08,319
I've seen that people

1939
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,319
are crazy about it.

1940
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,319
I think it's more for beginners.

1941
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:14,319
I don't know if you know about it.

1942
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:16,319
No, I don't.

1943
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:18,319
I've heard about it.

1944
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:20,319
I know that it exists.

1945
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:22,319
I've never worked with it.

1946
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:24,319
Those are the best.

1947
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:26,319
Unreal...

1948
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,319
That's your league.

1949
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,319
I know.

1950
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:32,319
All the tooling

1951
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:34,319
from YouTube,

1952
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:36,319
all 7 products,

1953
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:38,319
IntelliJ,

1954
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,319
IDEA,

1955
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:42,319
EMUVIA,

1956
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:44,319
those are the only tools

1957
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,319
that you see.

1958
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:48,319
It's so complex.

1959
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:50,319
If a new player comes,

1960
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:52,319
it's a multigenerational effort

1961
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:54,319
to catch him.

1962
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,319
There are studios

1963
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:58,319
that left their in-house.

1964
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,319
You can't do more.

1965
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,319
There are so many things

1966
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:04,319
that need to be noticed.

1967
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,319
Out of all the animations,

1968
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:08,319
we always go more, more, more

1969
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:10,319
complex.

1970
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:12,319
Animation design.

1971
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:14,319
How do you put those animations together?

1972
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:16,319
Those are just clips.

1973
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,319
You need to make it smooth,

1974
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,319
so everything works.

1975
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:22,319
It's important

1976
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:24,319
because designers

1977
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:26,319
are more empowered

1978
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:28,319
to make the code themselves.

1979
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:30,319
Next generation.

1980
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:32,319
It's a bit of a problem.

1981
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,319
They really

1982
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:36,319
made something

1983
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:38,319
from scratch.

1984
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:40,319
The power of code.

1985
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,319
It's terrible.

1986
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:44,319
It's not nice.

1987
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:46,319
But it's interesting

1988
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:48,319
that an ideal engine

1989
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:50,319
has 3 languages.

1990
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,319
One is low-level,

1991
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:54,319
like C++.

1992
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:56,319
Unreal C++, by the way,

1993
01:14:56,319 --> 01:14:58,319
is really nice to use.

1994
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:00,319
It's not like C++,

1995
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:02,319
it has its own things.

1996
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
and it's also a reflection

1997
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
the second one is a scripting language

1998
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
it can be C sharp, it can also be a scripting language

1999
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
it can also be Python

2000
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
or some words that are written nicely

2001
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
and the last one is visual

2002
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
and you have to have that for a designer

2003
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
so you think in blocks?

2004
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
yes, or in node-based

2005
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
so you have these three things and you cover everything

2006
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
if you don't have any of those, it's a problem

2007
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
C++ is too low-level

2008
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I mean, you can work with it

2009
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
but it's clear that a block would be better

2010
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
with something more compact

2011
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
but Aril has C++ and node-based

2012
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
while Unity has, I don't know

2013
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
node-based you can make it

2014
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
if you have some plugins

2015
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
the other one has C sharp, but it's not low-level

2016
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
if you don't have low-level, you don't have performance

2017
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
if you don't have a scripting language

2018
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
you deal with C++

2019
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and with node-based

2020
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
you deal with spaghetti

2021
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I mean, it's crazy

2022
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
so the organization of the code

2023
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
you want to have in the text

2024
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
so these three things are perfect

2025
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
but there are none

2026
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and Aril is planning to add a scripting language

2027
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
one question is

2028
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
ok, you have Aril

2029
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
you have Aril

2030
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and then you have

2031
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
of course, you have to build

2032
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
specific pipelines for a lot of things

2033
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
asset pipelines

2034
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I'm also interested

2035
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
have you been able to develop

2036
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
some internal tooling

2037
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
or did it just go to the side?

2038
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
no, we didn't have anything like that

2039
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Aril has it nicely

2040
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
so you can extend the editor

2041
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Open Source is also an editor

2042
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
so you can do something there

2043
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
some automation

2044
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
you can do with the editor

2045
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
that's cool

2046
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
but other than that, nothing

2047
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
have you been able to buy

2048
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
some third-party tools

2049
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
you have a lot of tooling

2050
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
that specializes in sound

2051
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I don't know

2052
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
for sound, you have

2053
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Wyser

2054
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
and FMOD

2055
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
we didn't, because Aril

2056
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
has it nicely done

2057
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
in Unity, that's a problem

2058
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
you need it there

2059
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
so Aril is basically

2060
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
self-sufficient

2061
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
the only thing I missed

2062
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
was the backend

2063
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
we have PlayFab

2064
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
but you have to integrate it

2065
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Aril also started

2066
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
to work there

2067
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
now we started with the backend

2068
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
game engine is there

2069
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
you have it

2070
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
store, ok, we have it

2071
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
you use the backend

2072
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
from the store, from Steam

2073
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
then came Epic, then came consoles

2074
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
now it's not ok anymore

2075
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
you have to have cross-platform

2076
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
and backend is in PlayFab

2077
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
what do you think about the backend

2078
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
do you think it's

2079
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
a server side of the game

2080
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
or what do you think

2081
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
not from the game

2082
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
but where your profile is stored

2083
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
where your items are stored

2084
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
items, what you unlocked

2085
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
in the store

2086
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
do you develop it yourself

2087
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
no, we have PlayFab

2088
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
those are general things

2089
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
you can do

2090
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
but I don't think

2091
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
game mechanic, netcode

2092
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
is a thing

2093
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
netcode is a part of the backend

2094
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
that's Unreal, it's a game server

2095
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
we still have servers

2096
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
we currently have

2097
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
machines

2098
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
if someone doesn't want to, we can add

2099
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
a server

2100
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
which is the same code as

2101
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
the game, but it's stripped

2102
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
that's all Unreal

2103
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
it strips the graphics

2104
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
so it's a command line

2105
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
let me understand

2106
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
if I'm saying the same thing

2107
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
you make one codebase

2108
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
one game, and then

2109
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
you generate servers

2110
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
you get server side code

2111
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
client side code

2112
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and then you run server side code

2113
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
that's right

2114
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
what about communication

2115
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
server client, I assume

2116
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
it's optimised

2117
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
do you talk about it

2118
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
daily?

2119
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
what is netcode?

2120
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
what is netcode?

2121
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
the basics are

2122
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
traffic

2123
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
in all engines

2124
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
it's always

2125
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
high, fast paced

2126
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
it's always UDP

2127
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
you always have your own reliable

2128
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
functionality

2129
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
and you have to handle it

2130
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
on your own protocol

2131
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
for Unreal

2132
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
it has that

2133
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and it's nicely written

2134
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
with some difficulties

2135
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
if you have a lot of players

2136
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
but you handle it nicely

2137
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
because

2138
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
it's not just sending

2139
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
the designer decides

2140
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
this is what all players would like

2141
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
it has to be a framework

2142
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
how it will work

2143
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
and it's nicely put together

2144
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
to send it to you

2145
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
of course, here

2146
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
netcode is a gameplay

2147
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
you do it on your own

2148
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
netcode is a slippery

2149
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
definition of things

2150
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
but

2151
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
with netcode, you have to be careful

2152
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
that you don't know

2153
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
what kind of things will come

2154
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
you have to understand

2155
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
in Unreal

2156
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
what comes together

2157
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
what doesn't

2158
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
what does this mean

2159
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
and you have to be careful

2160
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
that you don't know

2161
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
what will happen

2162
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
you have to be careful

2163
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
that's the first thing

2164
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
the second thing

2165
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
is how do you

2166
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
make it

2167
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
synced

2168
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
how do you make it look

2169
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
that's

2170
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
that's

2171
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
that's

2172
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
that's

2173
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
time wizard

2174
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
because you have to ask yourself

2175
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
when are you

2176
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
in this moment

2177
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
because time is relative

2178
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
for everything connected to the server

2179
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
for example, you press a button

2180
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
one option is

2181
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
what happens

2182
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
you press it

2183
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and you get a response from the server

2184
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
it always goes forward

2185
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
because if you wait, it will crash

2186
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
it will be a disaster

2187
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
that means that you are

2188
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
in the future

2189
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
the server is not there yet

2190
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
the server will be there when it gets the input

2191
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and if it needs it, let's say it will

2192
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
you are in the future

2193
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
it's the same if you

2194
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
if you

2195
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
if you look at another player

2196
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
the server sent him the information

2197
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
but he sent you where he is

2198
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
at the moment

2199
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and where he was before

2200
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and you only know where he is now

2201
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
you have to interpolate that

2202
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
and maybe you will need more time

2203
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
because you don't know where he will go

2204
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
so he is in the past

2205
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
for the server, he is in the present

2206
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and where does it get complicated

2207
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
let's say you start an attack

2208
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
you start an attack that starts like this

2209
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
so it's in the future

2210
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and you find a guy

2211
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
who is in the past, but in the server

2212
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
he is in the present

2213
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
but you are in the future

2214
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
and that's why the server sent you

2215
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
and now you are in the past

2216
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and you get the registration back

2217
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
how you do that is

2218
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
by interpolating things

2219
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
in different ways

2220
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
if you start an attack

2221
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
what you can do is

2222
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
that the animation of the attack

2223
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
is slower than your ping

2224
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
so the server will send you

2225
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
you sent him first

2226
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
he started the attack

2227
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
when he sends you the answer

2228
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
back

2229
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
the second part of the ping

2230
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
and that means that the whole ping

2231
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
will go back

2232
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and you are synced

2233
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
because your attack was delayed

2234
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
and now it's cool

2235
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I get it, it's like FPGA

2236
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
when you have three cycles

2237
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
but there is one more problem

2238
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
so this is

2239
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
what we do

2240
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
in a controlled way

2241
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
we inject lag

2242
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
but in a very controlled way

2243
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
which means

2244
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
we show you where you were

2245
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
not where you are

2246
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
but we extrapolate a little

2247
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
to where you are

2248
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
so you have a feeling that it's easy

2249
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
but it's not

2250
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
how do you simulate this?

2251
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
in the beginning

2252
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
you simulate

2253
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
it's easy, it's not a problem

2254
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and that's it

2255
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
now you test it

2256
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
how do you know that it's a code

2257
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
which works

2258
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
how do you solve it?

2259
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
you go through the code

2260
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
you go through it

2261
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
until you know

2262
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
that it's for sure

2263
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
if it's something

2264
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
you go through it

2265
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and if it's formal

2266
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
you look at it

2267
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
you can introduce a lag

2268
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
so you get it earlier

2269
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
around two players

2270
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
who pressed something

2271
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and then you sit down

2272
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
and play the game

2273
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
these calculations

2274
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
run on

2275
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
both client and server

2276
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
yes, you have a different code

2277
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
every code

2278
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
as I said in the beginning

2279
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
you take it out of the server

2280
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
it's the same code

2281
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
not that it's expensive

2282
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
but it's the same code

2283
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
and in the code you have

2284
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
if you are a server

2285
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
else if you are a client

2286
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
why is that?

2287
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
it's impossible to write it differently

2288
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
you can't do it like that

2289
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
you choose it

2290
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
you see two contexts

2291
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
it's different

2292
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
there's no better way

2293
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
to write it

2294
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
the client does what the server does

2295
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
but it does it

2296
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
so it can predict in advance

2297
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
it's not a dumb client

2298
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
it's a complete interweaving

2299
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
it would be a complete duplication

2300
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and then you have

2301
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
the third option

2302
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
where the player

2303
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
plays it

2304
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
the second option

2305
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
is not the same as

2306
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
with time

2307
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
when the player starts

2308
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
the player will react

2309
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
to the animation he sees

2310
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
but that's in the past

2311
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
and he's in the future

2312
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
because he sent it

2313
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
but when you say

2314
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
future, past

2315
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
how much time

2316
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
depends on lag

2317
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
depends on ping

2318
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
60-100 ms

2319
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
that's a lot

2320
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
in this example

2321
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
he reacts to things

2322
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
that happened in the past

2323
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
it's a well-known reaction

2324
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
so in this example

2325
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
you switch his animation

2326
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
where it was

2327
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
so you help the player

2328
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
to make the prediction

2329
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
but then you have to be careful

2330
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
because if you do that

2331
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
the hit won't be synced

2332
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
he'll go over

2333
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and you have to be careful

2334
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
from the calculations

2335
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
you have to make

2336
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and then we come to the idea

2337
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
of 64 players

2338
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
that you have on the server

2339
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
no, we come to that idea

2340
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
because in our example

2341
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
the server takes all the physics

2342
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
and all the calculations

2343
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and all the animations

2344
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
so if you shoot

2345
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
he'll say

2346
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
ok, you shot, cool

2347
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
and if the server confirms

2348
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
he can't check the animations

2349
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
in this example it's ok

2350
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
it's ok between the ones

2351
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
that defend and the ones that attack

2352
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
in the shooter it's not that important

2353
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
that's why we work on the server

2354
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
and we couldn't optimize

2355
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
to have more than 64

2356
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
we came to 80

2357
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
but you need

2358
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
mega hardware for that

2359
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
and very specific machines

2360
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
they are very specific machines

2361
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
but it's true

2362
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
that if you have more players

2363
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
you can do less things

2364
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
if you have

2365
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
one or two players

2366
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
you won't get

2367
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
as many machines

2368
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
to be able to shoot

2369
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
for 64 it's better

2370
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
but yeah

2371
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
it's mainly for optimization

2372
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
it's very important

2373
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
to be able to shoot on the server

2374
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
you need profiling

2375
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
and everything

2376
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and then look

2377
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
what takes you so long

2378
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
the line is spinning

2379
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
every frame

2380
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
why

2381
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
you give a side

2382
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
and a simple one

2383
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
or you miss something

2384
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
that was in the visual scripting

2385
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
that is heavy

2386
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
or I don't know

2387
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
they have it in physics

2388
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
but they are far enough

2389
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
that they don't need it

2390
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
one thing we have is

2391
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
level of detail

2392
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
it's not just a code

2393
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
if it's to the side

2394
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
the tick changes

2395
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
every code is based on frame time

2396
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
as much as it is

2397
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
what you can do

2398
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
if you hit a note on the right place

2399
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
you give it more tick time

2400
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
and you tick it less

2401
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
and that way you balance it

2402
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
so the refresh rate

2403
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
is lower

2404
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
which is closer

2405
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
and more important

2406
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
for everything else

2407
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
connected to the code

2408
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
when I listen to it

2409
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I'm so proud of it

2410
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
globally

2411
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
where do you think

2412
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
the state of art is located

2413
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
in the industry

2414
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I feel like

2415
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
you are top of the top

2416
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
on team size

2417
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
we are almost done

2418
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
for the feel

2419
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
of the impact

2420
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
it's top

2421
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
it went through

2422
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
really well

2423
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
the games that came out

2424
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
don't have that sync

2425
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
half of the people laugh

2426
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
and say they did it better

2427
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
there are other things

2428
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
that could be better

2429
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
but we haven't seen

2430
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
anything better

2431
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
so much freedom

2432
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
do you think

2433
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I will

2434
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
will we see

2435
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
games that cost

2436
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
more than 60 players

2437
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
maybe play karate

2438
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
or

2439
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
will we be able to change

2440
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
paradigms, hardware

2441
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
will we get better hardware

2442
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
on the server side

2443
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
what will we do

2444
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
it usually goes

2445
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
to one point

2446
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
but then you have to think

2447
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
that you have more followers

2448
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
this brings

2449
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
some problems

2450
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
what if you are on the border

2451
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
and you see the other side

2452
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
this can be solved

2453
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
with design

2454
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
but then you are back

2455
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
on your own

2456
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
so if you have a seamless world

2457
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
you have to use boundaries

2458
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
but how do you get there

2459
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
there are tools for multiplayer

2460
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
frameworks

2461
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
that handle this

2462
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
and are easily integrated

2463
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
in Unreal

2464
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
but in those tools

2465
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
as soon as you change a low-level thing

2466
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
it breaks for updates

2467
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
they have all the features

2468
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
to mirror you through boundaries

2469
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
to see that it is seamless

2470
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
it becomes very complicated

2471
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
that's why we have this podcast

2472
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
that's what we said before

2473
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I made them

2474
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
a few years ago

2475
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
it was that advanced

2476
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
and then came game development

2477
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
pure technology madness

2478
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
recently I was

2479
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
looking for

2480
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Epic Games

2481
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
to see

2482
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
that Unreal Engine

2483
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
will eat

2484
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
movie production

2485
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
yes, yes

2486
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I don't know so much about it

2487
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
but I know they work a lot

2488
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
and they use it a lot in real-time

2489
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
the difference is that movies

2490
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
have been made fully offline

2491
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
which means that those things

2492
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
are set up, you press a button

2493
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
and a server machine

2494
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
that cost you a lot

2495
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
drives it

2496
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
and they worked

2497
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and drew one frame

2498
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
and that was it

2499
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and then the next day

2500
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
you draw another frame

2501
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Unreal is real-time

2502
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
different techniques are used

2503
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
especially now

2504
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
when we have ray tracing

2505
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
we are moving in that direction

2506
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I mean, ray tracing is a totally different thing

2507
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
it's not that

2508
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
but they are moving in that direction

2509
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
and at some point

2510
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
it will be possible to start

2511
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
with those machines

2512
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
that are not used so much now

2513
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
so they are forcing

2514
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
real-time movie making

2515
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and it's much more valuable

2516
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
it's easier to change

2517
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
maybe you don't make

2518
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
the same quality

2519
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
but you can change

2520
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
in the scene

2521
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
in the movie itself

2522
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
how you do it

2523
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
to make a better result

2524
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and that's a lot

2525
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
it can be connected

2526
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
to Unreal 5

2527
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
we saw that Lani

2528
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I think he came

2529
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Lani or before Lani

2530
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Unreal 5

2531
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I saw that demo

2532
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
for Unreal 5

2533
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
when the lady walks

2534
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
and dances

2535
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
and it was like

2536
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and you were so impressed

2537
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
that you had a headache

2538
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
they marketed it

2539
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
very well

2540
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Unreal 5

2541
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
it's a version bump

2542
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
but

2543
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
we are on Unreal 4

2544
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
.27

2545
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
and that was Unreal 5

2546
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
but

2547
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
let's say that it's Unreal 4

2548
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
.30

2549
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
not such a difference

2550
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
in programming terms

2551
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it's still the same engine

2552
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
the same engine

2553
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
let's talk about marketing

2554
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
it's the same engine

2555
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
there are new features

2556
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
huge features

2557
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
you can open

2558
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Unreal 4.27 project

2559
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
in Unreal 5

2560
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
and it will work

2561
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
you don't need to do anything

2562
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
the difference is

2563
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
that they added

2564
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
node called Nenite

2565
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
for virtualized geometry

2566
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
so you don't need

2567
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
to deal with performance

2568
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
and they added a lot of other things

2569
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
that they added

2570
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
just because they added that

2571
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
you need real-time lighting

2572
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
or illumination

2573
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
illumination

2574
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
and then different

2575
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
shadow casting

2576
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
that shadow casting

2577
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
that is more dynamic

2578
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
because traditionally

2579
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
that shadow casting

2580
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
is different

2581
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and if you have that Nenite node

2582
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
it doesn't work anymore

2583
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
and you need a different

2584
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
shadow casting

2585
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
but the code is the same

2586
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
in the end

2587
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
all those new features

2588
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
it's unstable

2589
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
you don't need to use it

2590
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
even Epic said

2591
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
don't ship anything

2592
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
we don't know where it went

2593
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
it's a full heavy performance hit

2594
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
when you add that Nenite

2595
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
you think, ok cool

2596
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
now I can perform much better

2597
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
but the problem is

2598
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
we need global illumination

2599
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
and now we need to cast those shadows

2600
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
in every 10ms frame

2601
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
so for once

2602
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
we don't know

2603
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
how much of that will be used

2604
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
especially for a game like MatTV

2605
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
that happens a lot

2606
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
multiplayer and all

2607
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
is it even more known

2608
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
than single person

2609
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
or some easier mechanic

2610
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
it's most known for

2611
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
big open world games

2612
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
like you are

2613
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
which we aren't

2614
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
in this game it's known

2615
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
we had a lot of characters

2616
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
and those characters

2617
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
don't get anything

2618
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
because Nenite is only

2619
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
for static geometry

2620
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
so this is still classic

2621
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
but it goes in that direction

2622
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
that

2623
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
their goal

2624
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
is not to make things look better

2625
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
but to make it easier

2626
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
at the moment

2627
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
we make a level

2628
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
one model

2629
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
then we need to generate

2630
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
level of detail models

2631
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
which are always wrong

2632
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and then you need a system

2633
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
that handles that

2634
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
then you go to the side

2635
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
and you need to optimize

2636
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
that character

2637
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
and put less material

2638
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
and less texture

2639
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
and when you're done

2640
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
it lasts

2641
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I don't know

2642
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
half an hour

2643
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
it means that you need to

2644
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
calculate the light

2645
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
for every option

2646
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
where the light is

2647
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and you can see that

2648
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
for every map

2649
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
you can build this

2650
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and that

2651
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
let me explain

2652
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
for every level

2653
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I need to calculate

2654
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
for every option

2655
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
where the light is

2656
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
and then I need to bake it

2657
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
is that right?

2658
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
you calculate the light

2659
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
for the player

2660
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
it doesn't matter

2661
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
because they move

2662
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
for static objects

2663
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
you calculate that

2664
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
plus you calculate the essence

2665
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
and you bake it

2666
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
and you put it in the binary

2667
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
and that's very confusing

2668
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and there's one more thing

2669
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and that's not the only thing

2670
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
there's one more thing

2671
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
for one model

2672
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
you have the level of detail

2673
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
but you don't have it all

2674
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
and now you need to put

2675
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
a hierarchical level of detail

2676
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
specific for that level

2677
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
and combine it

2678
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
in one model

2679
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and we call that H-LOD

2680
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and you need to build that too

2681
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
and it lasts

2682
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
50 minutes, 40 minutes, 30 minutes

2683
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and then it crashes

2684
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
and then you do CI

2685
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
isn't that a beefy machine

2686
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
where you say calculate

2687
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
and it lasts for 3 days

2688
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
now we use

2689
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
team city

2690
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
to coordinate things

2691
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
we have a beefy machine

2692
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
and

2693
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
it builds

2694
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
it plays by itself

2695
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
it plays by itself

2696
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
everyone has their own part

2697
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
where they live

2698
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
but in the past

2699
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
someone had one at home

2700
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
another programmer

2701
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
for that

2702
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
highlight

2703
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Goran told us

2704
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
that there's so much

2705
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
change

2706
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
for engine and game

2707
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
builders

2708
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
tooling for artists

2709
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
who have to

2710
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
work on assets

2711
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
characters

2712
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
that tooling

2713
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
wasn't mature

2714
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
for that complex

2715
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
besides that

2716
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
there's ray tracing

2717
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
because

2718
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
now

2719
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
when an artist works on a model

2720
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
he has to simplify things

2721
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
there can't be too much detail

2722
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
that's why we bake details

2723
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
into a normal map

2724
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
that shows you the details

2725
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
in a hacky way

2726
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
if you want to have a reflection

2727
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
then you have a material

2728
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and you write in a texture

2729
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
the right things

2730
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
but that's all

2731
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
full of

2732
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
layers

2733
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
and

2734
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
it's all

2735
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
in a

2736
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
that you have to add and save for them, and I don't know what.

2737
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
If you have such a system, then you don't have to

2738
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
hack it, because it handles it, when you import it,

2739
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
the engine handles it, and it streams it in such a way

2740
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
that you get exactly what you need, and nothing more, nothing less,

2741
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
and you don't have to mess with it. If you have ray tracing,

2742
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
for example, you don't have to mess with various reflections,

2743
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
which you hack in some way, and stuff like that.

2744
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
In fact, game development is full of hacks.

2745
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And if you want to have a scene, if you want to have a view,

2746
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
you make a camera that captures the whole world,

2747
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and then you capture it as a texture.

2748
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I've heard that it's true.

2749
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
It's more because of the design.

2750
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Because of the design, yes.

2751
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Yes, and your job is to make a matrix

2752
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
on a very weak hardware,

2753
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
so people think it's like that.

2754
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
And if someone doesn't watch it, it's not like that.

2755
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Our animations disappear

2756
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
if you don't watch them.

2757
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
We had a problem that people didn't hear

2758
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
if someone was following them. Of course not.

2759
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
If they were walking, right?

2760
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I still have this question.

2761
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I think we touched on how you handle

2762
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
spike games.

2763
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
You mentioned that you have

2764
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
a suicide code.

2765
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Probably after you went to the Steam store,

2766
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
you were on the first chart,

2767
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
and then the Kickstarter.

2768
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Yes, everyone cursed at me.

2769
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
The game is successful.

2770
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Purely on hard.

2771
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I didn't have a back-end,

2772
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
but my colleague who had it said

2773
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
that he made it,

2774
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
everything worked,

2775
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
but when you play it so much,

2776
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
it doesn't work at all.

2777
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I think that in two days

2778
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
we changed the back-end on Steam.

2779
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Besides that, a lot of other things

2780
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
didn't work.

2781
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
The servers had a docker

2782
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
that made the server perform

2783
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
in a terrible way.

2784
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I fixed it a bit,

2785
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
but I don't remember now.

2786
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Is that from the perspective

2787
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
of SRE?

2788
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
You also sold a lot of

2789
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Gatling and KSX for load testing.

2790
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Is that because you didn't test

2791
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
the load of your system?

2792
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
You didn't expect that?

2793
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Honestly, I don't know

2794
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
how much we tested,

2795
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
how much time we had for that.

2796
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
He was doing all the testing.

2797
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
That's how it should be.

2798
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
At the last moment,

2799
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
there was nothing bad.

2800
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
In the end, we fixed everything

2801
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
until the first week,

2802
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
because there's always a peak on Sunday

2803
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
and everything works until Friday.

2804
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Is there an email prepared

2805
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
for SRE?

2806
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
If a vendor calls,

2807
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
which one does it depend on?

2808
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It's all about the scenarios.

2809
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
If you show people

2810
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
all of their information,

2811
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
if you show them all of your equipment,

2812
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
leveling, progress,

2813
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
it's all about the map.

2814
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
That's how I see it.

2815
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I know what you're saying.

2816
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
You're a technical person.

2817
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I'm just trying to see

2818
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
if you have an email.

2819
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Let's talk a little bit

2820
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
about engineering.

2821
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
A few weeks ago,

2822
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Microsoft CEO said

2823
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
that they're having a hard time

2824
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
with C and C++.

2825
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
They're putting a lot of emphasis

2826
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
on Rust as a language of the future

2827
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
for low-level system programming.

2828
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I have a question for you.

2829
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Will C++ always dominate

2830
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
this industry and this market?

2831
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Do you think that Rust

2832
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
is a language of the future

2833
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
for low-level systems?

2834
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I don't know.

2835
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Rust is very specific.

2836
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
What we're doing with C++

2837
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
in Unreal is a subset

2838
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
defined by them.

2839
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It's a little bit like sellotape.

2840
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
You see the macro,

2841
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
put it up, and it works.

2842
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
It's a little bit scary.

2843
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
At the beginning,

2844
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
we didn't have any problems

2845
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
because C++ is so nicely handled.

2846
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
It has its own containers

2847
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
and garbage collection.

2848
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
For real-time gaming,

2849
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
it's really tricky.

2850
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
You can't have a spike frame.

2851
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
In simple games,

2852
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
if you have 120 frames per second,

2853
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
you have a spike of 5 milliseconds.

2854
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
It's important that they handle it.

2855
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
We've never had any problems.

2856
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Do you use C++ as a compiler?

2857
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Is it Unity or Visual Studio?

2858
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
No, it's Visual Studio.

2859
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
You have to know Visual Studio.

2860
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,000
You don't have other options.

2861
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It's very portable.

2862
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
If you're making an Unreal Engine,

2863
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
you can repack it for different platforms.

2864
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
We've been talking about it

2865
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
for a year now with Porting

2866
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
so it's not exactly the same.

2867
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
You have to have store integration.

2868
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
At the beginning,

2869
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
you had PlayStation, VR,

2870
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Xbox and Nintendo.

2871
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
It all works.

2872
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
If you're going to Nintendo,

2873
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
do you have to have someone

2874
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
who's an expert for Nintendo?

2875
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Do you think you can trust the technology?

2876
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
No, you don't have to be an expert.

2877
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I mean, you have a lot of

2878
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
macros for Blender.

2879
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Yes, of course.

2880
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
There are a lot of details.

2881
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
If you have a machine,

2882
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
it's better.

2883
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Shaders don't work anymore.

2884
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
You have to lower it a bit.

2885
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Unreal Engine does it well.

2886
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
It's a multi-platform game

2887
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
and you can set the settings

2888
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
and play the same game.

2889
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It's very well supported.

2890
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Are you going to have crossplay?

2891
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I don't think so.

2892
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
PC player base is too skilled.

2893
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Do you have it on Steam?

2894
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
No, we have it on Steam.

2895
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Our backend is on PlayFab.

2896
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Backend is a multi-platform game.

2897
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
PlayFab connects to everything

2898
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
and it's very helpful.

2899
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Epic Online Services

2900
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
is very free.

2901
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
It's a very good backend.

2902
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
What do they get out of it?

2903
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Epic account.

2904
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Is it included in the 5% royalty?

2905
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Yes, it is.

2906
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I don't know if it can be used for Unity.

2907
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I think it can.

2908
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
They want you to have an Epic account

2909
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
and you log in,

2910
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
and you get friends and players.

2911
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I understand.

2912
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I forgot to ask.

2913
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
2 out of 9 in Unreal Engine

2914
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
are interesting.

2915
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
One is MetaHuman.

2916
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Is it interesting for you and your characters?

2917
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
We worked on a pre-production

2918
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
and I don't think we'll use it.

2919
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Maybe we will.

2920
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It looks really good.

2921
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
What is MetaHuman?

2922
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
MetaHuman is a system

2923
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
created by Epic.

2924
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
It's a system for creating

2925
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
fully realistic people.

2926
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Human characters.

2927
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
It has rigged and animation ready.

2928
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,000
You can pose it,

2929
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
add facial hair,

2930
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
and it's generated on the sliders.

2931
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
If you have a realistic game,

2932
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
it's a go-to.

2933
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
It's 3D scanned.

2934
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
It's high resolution.

2935
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
It scans people?

2936
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
No, you can't get close to it.

2937
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
The problem is that it's so good

2938
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that you can't compare it

2939
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
to any other game you have.

2940
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I see you added Megascans to the game.

2941
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Megascans are like MetaHuman,

2942
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
but for other objects.

2943
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
They are fixed in the library.

2944
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
You can't add them.

2945
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
You can't do everything with Megascans.

2946
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
The problem is,

2947
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
what do you do when you have to add

2948
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
something new that doesn't exist?

2949
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Like Megascans.

2950
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
If you have everything with Megascans,

2951
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
and you add something that doesn't exist,

2952
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
you make a mistake.

2953
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
And then you have to fix it.

2954
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
With Megascans, for example,

2955
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
if you have a stone,

2956
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
usually it's 3D scanned,

2957
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
and you see what's shooting out.

2958
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
But we turn the stones around

2959
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
and put them here and there.

2960
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Megascans are cool,

2961
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
but they look exactly the same.

2962
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I remember two more things.

2963
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
You mentioned VR.

2964
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
More how to VR.

2965
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
How many people ask you that?

2966
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Not that many.

2967
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
It's an interesting idea.

2968
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
We're working on a new project,

2969
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
and all the projects we're working on

2970
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
are 3-4 years long.

2971
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So we're only focusing on that.

2972
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
But VR is interesting because it's growing.

2973
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
There's adoption on Quest.

2974
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Quest is huge.

2975
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
It's being sold like Xbox Series

2976
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
and PlayStation 5 consoles.

2977
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
It's huge.

2978
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Before, it wasn't feasible.

2979
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
You released a VR game,

2980
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
but it's still a compact experience.

2981
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
You don't need 3 years.

2982
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
In a year or two,

2983
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
with a team of 5 people,

2984
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
you can make a VR game.

2985
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
We're still looking for people.

2986
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
We need 30 people for our main game.

2987
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
There are 22 of us,

2988
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
so maybe 5 more people.

2989
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
We have 6 Oculus girls

2990
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
in the office.

2991
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
We're thinking about that.

2992
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Facebook is also interested.

2993
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Maybe.

2994
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
We don't know yet.

2995
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Are you going to release the games

2996
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
in pre-production?

2997
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
In pre-production,

2998
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
most of the people are still at Mordhau.

2999
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It's just the beginning.

3000
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Maybe next year,

3001
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
we'll be in full production.

3002
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I have a community question.

3003
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
It's an interesting time now.

3004
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
You can work from home.

3005
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
If you want to work at home,

3006
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
you can work on games.

3007
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
You can do everything by yourself.

3008
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
In the office.

3009
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
It's too big.

3010
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
You need a bit more space.

3011
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I was thinking about working at home.

3012
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
That's why you need a house.

3013
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Or a small office.

3014
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
A quarter of the size.

3015
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
We had a catapult.

3016
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
It can't be 90 kg.

3017
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
But it's something.

3018
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
People can learn everything.

3019
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
It's a strange golden age of knowledge.

3020
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
We used to go to libraries

3021
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
and take C++ books.

3022
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Then you had a CD.

3023
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Then you worked on Windows.

3024
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Now you can do it all at home.

3025
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I wonder how you and your team

3026
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
are connected.

3027
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Are you connected to Slovenia?

3028
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Are you connected to our region?

3029
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
It's not that important.

3030
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Are you connected to male enthusiasts?

3031
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I understand.

3032
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I agree with what you said.

3033
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
If you want to be a legit

3034
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
spokesperson

3035
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
in certain industries

3036
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
you have to come to the game.

3037
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
You can't just show

3038
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
what you have.

3039
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
You have to be credible.

3040
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
But you have to come to a point

3041
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
where you want to convince people.

3042
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
When it comes to work

3043
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
we were the opposite.

3044
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
We were remote in the beginning.

3045
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Until Lani we were 100% remote.

3046
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Then we moved to Ljubljana

3047
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
and now we have 22 people

3048
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
who are physically in Slovenia.

3049
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Do you have a lot of people in Slovenia?

3050
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
No, they are mostly here.

3051
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
One of them is from the original team.

3052
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
The other ones went to do their own things.

3053
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
They have been here for 8 years.

3054
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
We have a Slovenian team.

3055
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
We are still looking for people.

3056
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
It's a different feeling

3057
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
when you are in the office.

3058
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It's definitely easier to work

3059
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
when you don't have to focus on the media.

3060
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
You can coordinate things

3061
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
and that's a huge plus.

3062
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Andras wanted to ask

3063
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
about the European game.

3064
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
How did the indie festival come about?

3065
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
We were a bit unlucky

3066
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
with the timing.

3067
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
We released 2.19

3068
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
and then Corona hit.

3069
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
We were at Gamescom

3070
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
and connected with the developers.

3071
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
We also had the SGC conference.

3072
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Then it kind of stopped

3073
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
and now it's starting again.

3074
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I hope it will continue.

3075
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Today's episode is a bit longer

3076
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
than usual, but...

3077
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,000
I just wanted to say that

3078
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Lulat is our...

3079
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
No, I didn't mean that.

3080
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I just wanted to say that

3081
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I don't know, I think it's possible.

3082
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Marko, what would you like to conclude?

3083
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I would like to ask

3084
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
that there is so much knowledge,

3085
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
energy, optimization,

3086
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
details...

3087
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Now it's going to be explicit.

3088
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
There is a lot of shit in this game.

3089
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And when I listen to it,

3090
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I think that 30 euros for a game like this

3091
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
is way too much.

3092
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
A lot of engineering knowledge,

3093
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
passion and knowledge.

3094
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I think it's...

3095
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Congratulations for a successful release.

3096
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Congratulations for overcoming

3097
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
all those technical challenges.

3098
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I think it's possible to play this game.

3099
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I don't have any questions,

3100
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
but I think the price is too low.

3101
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I don't know about that,

3102
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
but I understand what the market is like.

3103
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
It's not easy to help you.

3104
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
You have to balance a few things

3105
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
with the price.

3106
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
It depends on how many players you have.

3107
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
If you give a high price,

3108
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
you can sell the same amount

3109
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
but with fewer players.

3110
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
That's why it's free to play.

3111
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
By the way, today, Thursday,

3112
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I don't know when it goes up.

3113
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
On Monday.

3114
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
We have a free weekend.

3115
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Today we have a free weekend.

3116
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Today we have a free weekend at home.

3117
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Let's talk about social media.

3118
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
We can write about it,

3119
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
we can talk about it,

3120
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
we can promote it

3121
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
and listen to the content.

3122
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
We can do whatever we need to do.

3123
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Damage is probably the top.

3124
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Now you're a director.

3125
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
You're not a technical director.

3126
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,000
You're a technical director.

3127
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I'm also a technical director.

3128
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
How do you balance that?

3129
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Tell me more about that.

3130
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I've heard from you that those challenges

3131
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
with milliseconds and shaders

3132
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
are more interesting than

3133
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
what you're doing now.

3134
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
No, that's for sure.

3135
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I've taken on some other responsibilities.

3136
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Then I put them aside.

3137
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So everything is balanced in time.

3138
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
There's always something new.

3139
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
It's not about managing people.

3140
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
That's not my goal.

3141
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Yes, in time.

3142
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,000
We find someone else to manage it.

3143
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
You delegate.

3144
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Marko Grgurovic,

3145
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
thank you for sharing your knowledge

3146
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
and experience with us today.

3147
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We wish you all the best

3148
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
in the future.

3149
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
I wish you all the best.

3150
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Do you want to add anything?

3151
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
No, thank you for the invitation.

3152
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
I don't know.

3153
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
If you're making games,

3154
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
send us an email.

3155
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
If you're interested in working in the industry,

3156
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
send us an email.

3157
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
We're open to suggestions.

3158
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
We're here.

3159
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
We have a few more industries in Slovenia.

3160
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Not only mobile,

3161
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
but we also have a studio.

3162
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Thank you.

3163
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I'd like to thank

3164
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Goran Kudruno, Janko Tometelko

3165
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
and Andrei Skoto

3166
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
for helping us prepare this episode.

3167
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Thanks to Andraž Brodnik for co-hosting.

3168
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Thank you.

3169
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
If you liked this episode,

3170
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,000
please share it.

3171
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Leave a comment and play some games.

3172
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
So, get up in the morning and go to bed.
