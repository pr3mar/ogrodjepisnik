1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
10 seconds have elapsed. We can start with a special episode of the garden, with the first experimental episode that we added today, the first video and we have gathered here

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that today we will try to upgrade our garden and finish the first season and add lights, microphones, videos and set up an experimental platform for the future.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And today we have a special guest here, we have Tom치코 Zaman, and with me is Mr. Sraka.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And today we have gathered here to talk a little bit about greenhouses, to talk a little bit about gardening, to talk a little bit about why it is such a great start.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now here we have a bunch of cameras, light, cyberpunk theme we have chosen and we have done all this so that we could talk about Type 3 and PHP.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Today we have invited Zaman and Skobilja.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is all being edited, right?

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know, because we have spent a lot of money on cameras and gear, so I don't know if we have a lot of money for post-production.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My intro to the guests is disastrous, so I have to ask you first if you can introduce yourself and tell us who you are and where do you start.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ok, I am Tom치코 Zaman, not Zaman, from Skobilja, not Skobilj. Skobilja is a vast village on the Slovenian side, which is in Hungary.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do I do for a living? Well, at the moment, as you mentioned, I work in a printing house, or I want to create a name in the printing house business.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But my career in the printing house business lasts a year or two at most. Before that, I was the founder of a company in Denmark called Codable, and this company will be celebrating its 10th anniversary in January 2023.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I decided that it was time to take on a new challenge. I fell in love with the company, and I fell in love with the printing house.

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It was a challenge for me to be attracted to it. I mean, I didn't enjoy it, but I have to thank God that I am lucky enough to be able to decide and change things around me,

15
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to get a job, to go into the future of happiness, because I think that today there is too little emphasis on that. From the very beginning, we raise kids, they go to school, they get a job, and then they die.

16
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I see that I am happy, that the people around me are happy, and maybe the kids grow up in that direction.

17
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Very interesting. We have known each other for a long time, and we have had the opportunity to meet. You and your wife fly into my Twitter stream. Thank you for that.

18
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

19
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So you are starting something, right? You are now taking over the influence. I don't know, because I clicked on one of your YouTube videos by accident, you are now a YouTuber.

20
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes, a 14-day career. Actually, I want to make a name for myself, even at home, maybe, because I used to, well, I don't think of it as a compliment, just a compliment, but I made a name for myself in the WordPress world,

21
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:56,000
because we somehow found it in my previous business, and we went around the world at various conferences, and I reached a level where people knew who I was.

22
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We are a Slovenian band, because we practically didn't have a website in Slovenia, which is such a small market for these things that we are not interested in advertising or anything like that.

23
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We are quite well-known around the world, I would say maybe among the top 10-20 companies in terms of knowledge or some reputation. So it was very outside-focused all together.

24
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Now, with Tipkovnica, I would say that you would like to start in Slovenia as a sort of playground. The market is so small that even if everyone knows that you are doing something great, there are still very few people who know that you are doing something great.

25
00:05:40,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you look at a wider audience globally, you can see that you are growing very quickly, and I'm a bit of a fan of these things, especially the promotion of Tipkovnica.

26
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is your hobby, right? Those lights, right? And all that gear, right? That's probably what attracts you. If you go there, you still experiment in those waters, right?

27
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, that's true. That's the other side of the coin. I don't know why I have so many lights. I have so many lights at home, and the postman brings a new one, and the woman holds her head, because I have so many lights.

28
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And then I said, OK, but we have to use them in something, because there are not enough people, because if you have them, you have them, and that's it. And then I said, well, I'm going to put a YouTube studio at home, and I'm going to light it up nicely.

29
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:06,000
For my taste, it's a pretty good job, but other colleagues and friends can see how you light it up, and then the debate starts, so I can say that I'm making a hobby out of this.

30
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I wrote to you in the intro that you would like to draw from you today love for technology, passion, persistence, extreme focus.

31
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What did I want to draw from this question, to ask you, why do you want to do something? I think that a lot of your projects you do for yourself, for your fun, you have to have some kind of passion for these things.

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I think that if you find that passion, then you are 100% committed and brutally focused. And what if it's not like that?

33
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I've never been to a proper diagnosis, but I always, I don't know if it's an excuse or not, but I often say that I have a little ADHD, a little bit of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

34
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:44,000
One extreme is that when someone accepts me for a reason that I don't know, and then they hold me, and at the moment they are lights, and I buy lights, and I choose lights, and why they are the way they are, and how they work, and color spectrums, and I'm looking for a lot of things.

35
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't have a business need for these things, I'm just interested, and then I draw as long as it takes, and it takes a long time.

36
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you go to the end, or do you try?

37
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll put it this way, it depends on what the end is. Sometimes I get to a level where my brain says, okay, that's good enough, let's move on.

38
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sometimes I draw them, for example, against the walls, specifically, because I thought, okay, let's do one again, and it will be good enough. But no, let's do one for every other countryman, and let's do half of them.

39
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But on the other hand, there are things that don't attract me, don't interest me, and I won't do them. I mean, it's like paying the bill. And we didn't make a deal here.

40
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Here, the deal is just that I have to log into a joint bank, I mean, I have to open a bank, and then I have to show my picture on my phone to be identified, and they give me a bill, and then I have to put it in my computer, and then I go to the next step.

41
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:06,000
In the next step, I get another bill, and then I have to put it in my phone again, and then I have to enter the numbers in there, and I get sick of it. But you haven't made a deal there yet, and then when you pay, you have to send the bill to the accountant. It's a pain.

42
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How did you optimize this part of your life? Because everything that is in this composition, let's say, you have four children.

43
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes, yes, yes.

44
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This work-life balance, how do you manage it now? When you start from scratch, and you're healthy now, and at the same time you still have to take care of your family, and then there are other things to do, because you also have to pay bills.

45
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, look, my recipe was that I learned, and then you just have to, because a woman comes with advantages and advantages, and also with a stick in her hands, I'm not kidding.

46
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:14,000
My wife is a great woman, and she also strengthens this balance for me at times, because she has to, because sometimes I fall so much into something that I ignore life.

47
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's like, I don't know, you have to drive your children to training, and it's already 6.30 in the morning, and I'm already in one thing until 8 in the morning, and instead of going to eat something, a few cigarettes that don't hurt, and then back to action.

48
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Now I take it so much that I walk the dog a little in the garden to get some fresh air, but I fall so much into it that sometimes a woman comes and says, Tomas, you know you have four children, and I don't.

49
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not kidding, but she's the one who pulls me out of that hardcore focus. But on the other hand, she's also my biggest fan, which is also amazing.

50
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That she always supports me in all my stupidities, I don't know, I told myself I'd be a YouTuber. Most people are like, hahaha, what's wrong with you? And my wife is like, go for it.

51
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Everything is like that. We set up the last farm from scratch, and if my wife hadn't stood by my side, because we had four small children, credited, without cash, it really was a low point.

52
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And she actually brought me the rhythm, if I may say so, that we succeeded. Without her, there is no chance. That I can write four small rhythms, write a healthy code, sign agreements, promote, I mean, no go.

53
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You have to let go of something. And for us, it was a woman, my luck, and in the final phase, it's both women in the court of that relationship.

54
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't get it, how do you do it?

55
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What do you mean?

56
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You have a kid, and ten companies, how many do you have?

57
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, it's just ten women at a time.

58
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ten women, or what?

59
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Or one that's worth ten, right?

60
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, here's the thing, in the issues you mentioned, like passion, you also include children, right?

61
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Do children say such things, that you've started to combine something, so that the children are already...

62
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No! No! Children want to play football!

63
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And that's so... No, I support them, they won't help, but...

64
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I have to admit, I'm totally anti-football.

65
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think the whole team is here, but okay.

66
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I wouldn't say that, but anti-sport. I only deal with sports because of my health.

67
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm not like someone who watches sports on TV, whatever.

68
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It doesn't stimulate me, so I don't really care about that.

69
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I do want the kids to be a bit...

70
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Look, my first child, I'd coach football, cool, right?

71
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're a football coach, and you take your two kids, I mean, your oldest and youngest,

72
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and you take them to football, and they're good, and they go to competitions, and so on.

73
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Whatever comes to mind.

74
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But yeah, you want to be a programmer, but...

75
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They're in those years when they're so in love with football, and that's it.

76
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a bit too early for that.

77
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We'll see. But I do want to be able to help.

78
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I mean, look, financially you have to, because they're your kids,

79
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
but I want to be able to do more than just financially.

80
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But we have more times, let's say, if I apply to what we said before,

81
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I want to tell them that it doesn't matter where they start, as long as they're happy.

82
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's the most important thing to me.

83
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't look at it as a challenge.

84
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think that today, as a society, it's like, what do you do?

85
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And it's not like you're going to...

86
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's like you're going to deceive a person.

87
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
His value changes depending on where he starts.

88
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I do that to all my kids.

89
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You have to work hard.

90
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You can't do without it.

91
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're not someone who's going to make you happy,

92
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
because then you're going to win in life.

93
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you're happy, I think that's number one.

94
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You know, when you listen to these inspirational speeches,

95
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and all together...

96
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If you look back at your youth,

97
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and when you were just looking,

98
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you probably didn't expect to work with technology,

99
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
with computers.

100
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You probably could've looked for it yourself.

101
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You probably could've put a lot of effort into researching it.

102
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Or you were like, I'm going to program it now.

103
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm not that, probably.

104
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But it's a passion, right?

105
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

106
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Actually, in IT, I fell...

107
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I fell for it.

108
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Actually, it was like this.

109
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I worked in the Biotechnical Faculty,

110
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
in the Department of Forestry.

111
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
After graduation, I was almost a forestry engineer,

112
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
because I didn't graduate.

113
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I practically did everything.

114
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I was a full-time gamer until FACS.

115
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm still a full-time gamer.

116
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

117
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Even today, when we come home,

118
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
we'll be with our colleagues, we've changed...

119
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What are you doing today?

120
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Tea, tea, tea.

121
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
My colleagues have their readings this week and next week,

122
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
so even at midnight, if I come, we'll be gaming.

123
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What are you playing today?

124
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Escape from Tarkov.

125
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We'll be shooting each other in the head.

126
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But...

127
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Wait, no, no, no.

128
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's really bad.

129
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

130
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you come home late today,

131
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
who will you be playing games with?

132
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
With my colleagues.

133
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
For example, I have a colleague from Germany.

134
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You'll be sleeping with your wife and kids, right?

135
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes, that's right.

136
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But have you changed?

137
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes, yes, yes.

138
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I ping them on Discord.

139
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Action, let's go.

140
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Online.

141
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Are they older or younger?

142
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Both.

143
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And younger teams.

144
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We've been living happily ever after,

145
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
because we've been playing together for a few years.

146
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We're 200 old, 40 give or take,

147
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and 200 old, 25 give or take.

148
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And we've been happy.

149
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We went to the seaside together for a few days.

150
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Retreat.

151
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
We're a proper team when we're gaming together.

152
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You know.

153
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So, yeah.

154
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And in my third year at Fax,

155
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I somehow had a hard time.

156
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There wasn't a single moment

157
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
where I was really drawn to the game.

158
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And that's why I said to myself,

159
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
OK, I'll program the website a bit,

160
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to see what it looks like up and down.

161
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And I actually pirated

162
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
some online courses for PHP.

163
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Woo!

164
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes, but I have to admit,

165
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
that I pirated them for a few years.

166
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But then, when we started using Scodable,

167
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
when we started using Dnar,

168
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I signed up for the same website I had pirated.

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And for a long time, I was paying the membership,

170
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
for as long as I was using pirated copies.

171
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Just because it was fair to give it back,

172
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
because it was what Jaro did in the end.

173
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You realized that you had to...

174
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, that's right.

175
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Sometimes you realize that

176
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the more effort you put into it,

177
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the more you start looking at it differently.

178
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Especially if you can translate it.

179
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I've now turned to this page,

180
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the first page of my notes.

181
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And on this page...

182
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Do you need help?

183
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No.

184
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And on this page, I've now written Codable.

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
OK.

186
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Not PHP, I think it's PHP.

187
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's all connected.

188
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Just wait for us to get to you.

189
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Because in the past,

190
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
when we were just starting,

191
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
some engineering and language examples,

192
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
there was a lot of feedback.

193
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
When will there be PHP?

194
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, shit, yeah.

195
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And in the last comment,

196
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
there was a comment that there will be PHP in the kitchen.

197
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What are we going to do?

198
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, I mean, we had...

199
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, yeah, a lot of people...

200
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
A lot of people...

201
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I won't say it again.

202
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
A lot of people are using PHP.

203
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
PHP is still an extremely popular language.

204
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why?

205
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're going to tell us now.

206
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And our audience is growing,

207
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and somehow it represents

208
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
a large segment of our web development audience.

209
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And logically,

210
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
people want to hear more about PHP.

211
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Now...

212
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's do this...

213
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Take on...

214
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
PHP,

215
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and try to connect it to Codable.

216
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Tell us why...

217
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Why did you make Codable,

218
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and where does it connect?

219
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We need to know that.

220
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And let's move on to...

221
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What was it, 10 years ago?

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
2013.

223
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It says 2012.

224
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah, okay, 2012.

225
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, well, all the beginnings were before.

226
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
On a business day,

227
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
or when we established the firm in 2013,

228
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
we were already working on it before.

229
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
PHP

230
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
has

231
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
one good feature,

232
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and one bad feature.

233
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What do you mean?

234
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
He wants to finish.

235
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And that's it.

236
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The main thing...

237
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay, yeah.

238
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Both, really.

239
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I mean,

240
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
the good thing is the early...

241
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
No, not early.

242
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Low barrier to entry.

243
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's because you can load it very quickly,

244
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the documentation is huge,

245
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the examples are huge,

246
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the tutorials are huge.

247
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
He has his

248
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
embedded

249
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
story,

250
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
which he really cares about,

251
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and...

252
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Personally,

253
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
when I see Codable,

254
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it has these tags in it,

255
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in HTML,

256
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and whatnot.

257
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The bad thing,

258
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
for example,

259
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
is that a lot of people

260
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
stopped there.

261
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's so fast

262
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
in some tasks,

263
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
which is a plus,

264
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
that people stop

265
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and wonder why it's so fast,

266
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
or why

267
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
they don't get bored.

268
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
With these basic constructs

269
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
that language offers,

270
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think a lot can be done,

271
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and a lot of people,

272
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
especially in my freelancing career,

273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
which was before Codable,

274
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
corrected some basic constructs

275
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that someone who didn't know

276
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the language enough,

277
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
but knew how to sell online,

278
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
made on some freelancing portals,

279
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and then hired me

280
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
to debug and correct it.

281
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He wrote his own function,

282
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and you have a built-in function

283
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that does the same thing

284
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
for one type,

285
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and doesn't need 30 types.

286
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm just kidding,

287
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but...

288
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You can say the same thing

289
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
about JavaScript,

290
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
or other languages in that space.

291
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You can also write Ruby.

292
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, really.

293
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But PHP is the most...

294
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's a culture that comes from Raven.

295
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I think it's more...

296
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
For example,

297
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
with my people,

298
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the mindset of people

299
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
who are...

300
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I don't want to offend anyone,

301
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't mean to offend anyone,

302
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
but the average mindset of people

303
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
in PHP, in my experience,

304
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
is much more satisfied

305
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
with the result

306
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
than the mindset of people

307
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
who write Ruby, for example,

308
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
or JavaScript,

309
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
who started writing

310
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
more difficult languages.

311
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's subjective,

312
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
but since I'm a guest,

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I have the right to say

314
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
that Ruby is more demanding

315
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
than PHP.

316
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think people go deeper

317
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
into the language,

318
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and devote themselves

319
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
to education.

320
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's the same in PHP,

321
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
but in my experience,

322
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
PHP is more like a community.

323
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's about doing something good

324
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
together.

325
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
While...

326
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No, no, I'm talking about PHP.

327
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
PHP communities are more like

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
a kumbaya scene.

329
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You know?

330
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's my experience.

331
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I have a lot of friends.

332
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I don't mean to derogate them.

333
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They're really good people.

334
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I've been to their conferences.

335
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I still go to them.

336
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't go to work anymore,

337
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
but I still go to meet them.

338
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's the law of the community.

339
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
On the other hand,

340
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
you have RubyFolk.

341
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I've been to a few of their conferences.

342
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm a developer,

343
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
but I don't bother them.

344
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I go to the other end.

345
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I go there to write

346
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
a fucking rocket for Mars

347
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
in Ruby.

348
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Maybe it's because you said

349
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
that the entry barrier

350
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
is so low in PHP.

351
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't know.

352
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I would say

353
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
that a common application

354
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
or something to do again

355
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
is to edit a file in PHP

356
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and upload it.

357
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
If the problem is solved in Ruby,

358
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
if it needs to be fixed,

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and connect the server

360
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
so that the problem

361
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
can be fixed.

362
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It could be that.

363
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
In PHP,

364
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
as you said,

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
you can use FTP,

366
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
which is ancient,

367
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and allow you to bypass

368
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
a lot of best practices,

369
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
which are very good in the long run.

370
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
As long as Ruby doesn't let you do that.

371
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I mean, both have their place.

372
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't want to say

373
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that Ruby is better

374
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
or PHP is better.

375
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,240
I know at least a few of them, because thank God all my jobs are so beautiful,

376
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:16,480
that when I came to Ruby, I could already hire a person who knows a lot more about the topic than I do,

377
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,000
and I could also hire someone for PHP, so I'm interested in a really good programmer,

378
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and I know how to solve a problem pretty well, so to speak.

379
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let me say, when you moved to Slovenia, you moved because people imagined our cuckoo,

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
up there is a cuckoo's eye, and you live inside it, in bigger streams, they say it's the end of the world,

381
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and then you fall down there.

382
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And Codable also comes from a problem you somehow discovered when you positioned yourself in that space,

383
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
so give me a little beginning, where is that place, where does Codable come from, and why did you make it?

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Which problem are you solving?

385
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:22,000
When my wife moved from Lithuania, where she was born with twins,

386
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
we lived there in Lithuania with a very small, modest population, and it was simply too small for four people,

387
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
for two it was ok, and at that point her older sister, Dinka, moved in,

388
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and we decided to live in Prekmurje, so she gave us an apartment,

389
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and at first it was like, fuck no, Prekmurje, no!

390
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But later, when we started to think rationally, and started to write some pros and cons on paper,

391
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
it was still like, we don't have any horses, ok, Delcje, but that's the only horse,

392
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
you know, I have a gigabyte of optics at home in the house, so you don't have to worry about everything,

393
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
so, yeah, and, ok, I don't have it at the moment, but there is some project,

394
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
or the project has really grown somehow, and we said, ok, let's go,

395
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and we moved up, and that's how I got into web development, and I worked with the TYPO3 system,

396
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and I'm a certified TYPO3 integrator, even though it's version 4.7,

397
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
if you don't know the version, how nice it is.

398
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And it's still alive?

399
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it's a corporate site, like Germany, they still have it,

400
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
but I don't know about us, but in Slovenia there was a whole gov scene on it.

401
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I think it's like that for undecided listeners or viewers,

402
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I worked with TYPO3, I don't know, two years ago I showed him how to set up a blog,

403
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
that kind of thing, it's very simple and complicated, but,

404
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,000
TYPO3 came about when people started to recognize TYPO3, or PHP, as a language,

405
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
as a platform that could be an alternative to Java at the same time, and so on,

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and that's when the open source started, and, I don't know how to say it, Kasper,

407
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
who made the enterprise CMS for TYPO3.

408
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And for a long time it was like a supervisor for the enterprise,

409
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
from Lufthansa to, I don't know who else.

410
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's a well-known place, where you need to go to school to understand it,

411
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
that's the precondition for enterprise software, and, no matter the high price,

412
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
without any other support, you can't buy it.

413
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He also had a very good, very small, he had this system of extensions,

414
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
you can imagine it as some kind of package management,

415
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
which we have in those, I don't know...

416
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Plugin management.

417
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Plugin, and that, and an extension called T3news, which was very powerful,

418
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
in fact, as if he had a Wordpress game inside.

419
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah.

420
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You see, I'm impressed.

421
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I know, I know.

422
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Look, I'll tell you this.

423
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Early days, TYPO3 was a very good circle for me,

424
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
because I was attracted to it.

425
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Actually, if I go back in time, before I die, it was on a fax,

426
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I went there because, I like to be attracted to things that interest me.

427
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
We've already discussed that.

428
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah, and when I started web development, I knew I needed a project.

429
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Because I'm very opinionated.

430
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
For example, when younger developers ask me where to start,

431
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
don't start anywhere.

432
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Start with the idea you have in mind, or the problem you have,

433
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
which you will solve.

434
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm very, how do you say it, I mean,

435
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
a supporter of learning with a known goal.

436
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I mean, not that I'm going to learn Force, Anche, Wile, whatever,

437
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
but find a problem.

438
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I don't have one.

439
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And then it's very difficult to learn.

440
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Find yourself a problem, or find a colleague in a problem.

441
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Ask him, I don't know what he's doing at home,

442
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
on the computer, whatever.

443
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Have a problem.

444
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And then go against the problem.

445
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But if you chose TYPO3, you made more problems in the beginning.

446
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
That's true.

447
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But I didn't choose it myself.

448
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I went to the fax directly to my computer science professor,

449
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
who had a joint venture with Lesar,

450
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
which is a truly catastrophic site.

451
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There are also static HTMLs in Driftweaver.

452
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Remember the days.

453
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
In Driftweaver, they edited it,

454
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and then copied it to FTP by hand from the fax.

455
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And I said, let's go.

456
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I just found a CMS, which had such a cute logo.

457
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I didn't know anything about it,

458
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and I didn't even know PHP,

459
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
if it was really basics,

460
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and I was so overconfident,

461
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
so self-assured to the professor.

462
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I would make a joint venture for you.

463
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He was delighted with the idea,

464
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but he was a loser.

465
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
TYPO3.

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So I said, okay.

467
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Look, it lasted half a year.

468
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
At home, I didn't sleep,

469
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and I failed exams,

470
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and I was in a hurry, but I made a site.

471
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I hired a designer,

472
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
who was one of the very good designers,

473
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
still is, actually.

474
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And he made me an interface.

475
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But let me brag.

476
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He said, how are we going to pay for it?

477
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I said, I'll make a site,

478
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and you'll pay for it,

479
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
because I had a scholarship,

480
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and I lived at home,

481
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
so the money wasn't a motivator,

482
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
because I was too young to have a good feeling about it.

483
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I said, you bought me a 16-inch MacBook Pro,

484
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
fully specced out.

485
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I made a site, TYPO3,

486
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and they bought me a fully specced out MacBook Pro,

487
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and I still have it on the shelf.

488
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It doesn't work anymore,

489
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
because the screen cracked,

490
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
but it was a high-quality machine for 10 years.

491
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And that's how we started,

492
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and that's how I ended up in TYPO3.

493
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Now, if I go back to what you asked me before,

494
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
how it was across the sea.

495
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Across the sea,

496
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I broke ties with the company

497
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
behind which I worked here in Ljubljana,

498
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
with which we cooperated,

499
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
because they wanted to put me on a site.

500
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So I went on a site in Ljubljana,

501
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and we...

502
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And I applied for a job on the internet.

503
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And I found an e-lance site,

504
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and I worked on it for two years,

505
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and in May I decided to get a certificate.

506
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And at the time, there wasn't as much as today,

507
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
when you get an online certificate.

508
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I could get in the car,

509
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and drive to the store in the Danube,

510
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and pay 200 euros,

511
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
because I was...

512
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't know how to call it,

513
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
a non-educated...

514
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Certification.

515
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, a certification.

516
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Thank you.

517
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And I paid there,

518
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and then I signed it,

519
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and it was so...

520
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It was hard,

521
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it wasn't like...

522
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
No, no,

523
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it was half a year of training.

524
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But the positive result of that

525
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
was that I became

526
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
much more competitive on those sites.

527
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Because I...

528
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I could overnight,

529
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and I'm not lying,

530
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
overnight I doubled my hourly rate,

531
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and I started having better projects.

532
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That's why I...

533
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Also in Coda,

534
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
later on I had my own thing,

535
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
for example, I was invited to international conferences,

536
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to teach about not being a price raiser.

537
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Let's...

538
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I wrote that on my own,

539
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll burn it all down.

540
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Okay, let's go to the end now.

541
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes, that's what I meant.

542
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Well, and...

543
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Because on that portal,

544
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
certain functionalities,

545
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
approaches,

546
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
mentality, founder, whatever,

547
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I was so confused,

548
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
that I wanted to be a competitor

549
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
to the portal that fucked me up,

550
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because it wasn't like I wanted it to be.

551
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, I hope you'll go to the bank one day.

552
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay, sorry.

553
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Anyway, well, and then I...

554
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I got to know,

555
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
while working on that portal,

556
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
someone who was on my side,

557
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
actually.

558
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The gentleman's name is Per Esbensen,

559
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
because he's Danish.

560
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And he was a businessman.

561
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I mean, he sold my computers,

562
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
in Danish,

563
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and we got along well.

564
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And we became friends.

565
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll tell you my story later.

566
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So...

567
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And then I got to a point where I said,

568
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Per, listen.

569
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I don't...

570
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Marketing,

571
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and banking,

572
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and accounting,

573
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I mean, those aspects...

574
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Accounting.

575
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
...accounting,

576
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm not...

577
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm not used to dealing with that.

578
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I said, let's two competitors

579
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
build this portal ourselves,

580
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'll take a programmer,

581
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll program the interface,

582
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
everything,

583
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and you'll have all the rest.

584
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And he liked the idea so much,

585
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
that he was so tired,

586
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
a few days before I told him,

587
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and he called me while he was tired,

588
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
when we went to a party,

589
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and he said, Tomas,

590
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
this is so good.

591
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I said, do you really know this?

592
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I said, I'll learn,

593
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and we'll do it.

594
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Well, and...

595
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah.

596
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Here's the thing.

597
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know if we got it.

598
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I mean,

599
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
this is a site,

600
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
or rather,

601
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
a site that solves this problem,

602
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
that connects some freelancers,

603
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
who have their own sites,

604
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
developer sites.

605
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Right, right.

606
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So you have a market

607
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
for developers,

608
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and for companies

609
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
looking for someone

610
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
to implement things.

611
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

612
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And back then,

613
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
but everyone knew,

614
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
everyone knew,

615
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
that we two couldn't

616
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
compete with someone

617
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
like eLens,

618
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
who got millions

619
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
of risky capital,

620
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
couldn't compete with two

621
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
NHL players from Prekmurje,

622
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and...

623
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But you didn't know

624
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
on the internet.

625
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, that's true.

626
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Anyway,

627
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and that's why

628
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I decided on WordPress,

629
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
especially because

630
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
it's a niche,

631
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
but a pretty big niche.

632
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'll be honest,

633
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
back then,

634
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I had no idea

635
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
about WordPress.

636
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
To the point

637
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
when we established

638
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
a WordPress company,

639
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I hadn't seen

640
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
WordPress from...

641
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
How did you do

642
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
that research?

643
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I don't get it,

644
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I don't get it.

645
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
How did you do that research,

646
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that now WordPress

647
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
is almost the same?

648
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
We knew, for example,

649
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
that there has to be

650
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
some programming,

651
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
because I was a programmer,

652
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
but...

653
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
WordPress,

654
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
after a year,

655
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
was selling a lot,

656
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and WordPress was the most...

657
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That was it.

658
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
By the numbers.

659
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But developers

660
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
were mostly

661
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
in WordPress.

662
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I mean,

664
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
you probably

665
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
stopped it

666
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
so that

667
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
a percentage

668
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
of the business

669
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
goes to you,

670
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
or what,

671
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and how does

672
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the market work,

673
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
so that it's a bit

674
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
more decisive.

675
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah,

676
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
let me first tell you

677
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
what problems

678
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
we had.

679
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
When Per

680
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
announced his job

681
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
at eLens,

682
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
150 developers

683
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
applied,

684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
of which

685
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
149

686
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
from third-degree

687
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
countries,

688
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and me.

689
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Me,

690
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
when I applied

691
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
for some projects,

692
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
it didn't matter

693
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
if they were from Per

694
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
or someone else,

695
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I had to compete

696
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
with 149

697
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
offers from

698
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
third-degree countries,

699
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
no,

700
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
less-degree countries,

701
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you know what I mean.

702
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Anyway,

703
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the problem was

704
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that

705
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
the mentality

706
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
of those people

707
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
is usually

708
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
more of a

709
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
fast learner,

710
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
someone who can

711
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
learn fast,

712
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and that's it.

713
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
No quality,

714
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
no hard understanding,

715
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
just that

716
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
fast turnaround,

717
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and they're

718
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
so serious,

719
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
not all of them,

720
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but most of them

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
are so serious,

722
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
you know,

723
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
they have some

724
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
written goals

725
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and they just

726
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
apply for everything,

727
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and what happens,

728
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
happens.

729
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And I said,

730
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't like this,

731
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
let's create

732
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
a portal,

733
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I mean,

734
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
what would I solve,

735
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
when I introduced

736
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
my company

737
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
to a

738
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
pre-screened

739
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
developer,

740
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and I still

741
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
face

742
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
the biggest challenge

743
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
in this company,

744
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
which is to keep

745
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
the supply

746
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and demand

747
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
level.

748
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I mean,

749
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
for us,

750
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
a developer

751
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
is a kind of

752
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
expectation

753
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
for a system

754
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
to be ready

755
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
within a few months,

756
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and when we

757
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
found it

758
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
ourselves,

759
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
it's a very

760
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
rigorous process,

761
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and it's

762
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
optimized time-to-time,

763
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
so that,

764
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
so that when

765
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
you have too many

766
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
parties,

767
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and too few

768
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
developers,

769
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
you will be in

770
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
competition,

771
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and if you have

772
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
too many developers,

773
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
you will be in

774
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
competition with

775
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
developers,

776
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
because they

777
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
don't have enough

778
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
work.

779
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I mean,

780
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
you always want

781
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
this,

782
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and this is

783
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
always this

784
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
balancing act,

785
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
never-ending,

786
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
which you always

787
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
look for,

788
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I mean,

789
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
how many

790
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
developers,

791
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
how many

792
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
parties,

793
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
right?

794
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean,

795
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
we had tutorials,

796
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
we wrote articles,

797
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
we had an e-learning

798
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
system,

799
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
which was

800
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
intended for them,

801
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I mean,

802
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the price,

803
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and if the price

804
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
is less than

805
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
60 euros per hour,

806
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
it's a conversation

807
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
with us,

808
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
with our customer

809
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
support,

810
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
why are you

811
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
paying so much,

812
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
right?

813
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Is it really

814
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that

815
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
low-effort

816
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
project,

817
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
but

818
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
then we also

819
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
dribbled them,

820
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
you know,

821
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
price your time,

822
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
right?

823
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't know what

824
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you did,

825
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
then,

826
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
for example,

827
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I didn't go,

828
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
sorry,

829
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
because I couldn't

830
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
at the time,

831
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
but I was

832
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
attracted to

833
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
an Indian message,

834
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
for example,

835
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
because he said,

836
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
come,

837
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
because of you,

838
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I mean,

839
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
because of you,

840
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
because of

841
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
what you

842
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
enable me,

843
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I will

844
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
order,

845
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
you know,

846
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and you hear

847
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
such a story,

848
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
or

849
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
our developer

850
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
came to me,

851
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
so to speak,

852
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
so that

853
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
this problem

854
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
we wanted to

855
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
solve in

856
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
WordPress.

857
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Do you think

858
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
that,

859
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I mean,

860
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
if WordPress

861
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
is a

862
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
garden,

863
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and

864
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
if you know

865
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
what a garden

866
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
is,

867
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
then you

868
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
can,

869
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
for example,

870
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
if you're a

871
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
good developer,

872
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
you really

873
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
know what

874
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
a garden

875
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
is,

876
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and then

877
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
you can

878
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
technically,

879
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
theoretically,

880
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
probably choose

881
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
a WordPress

882
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
site and

883
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
do it,

884
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I mean,

885
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
you don't

886
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
need any

887
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
extra

888
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
planning

889
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
in those

890
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
projects,

891
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
or what,

892
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
if you

893
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
probably

894
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
wanted to

895
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
work,

896
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I don't

897
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
know,

898
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
with Java

899
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
or some

900
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
C-Sharp,

901
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
the response

902
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
of the

903
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
project is

904
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
completely

905
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
different,

906
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
then

907
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
complications,

908
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
then,

909
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
you know,

910
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
you can't

911
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
replicate

912
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
it in

913
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
any other

914
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
site,

915
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
no,

916
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
you can't

917
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
replicate it,

918
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I think

919
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
it's because

920
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
of WordPress,

921
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
because,

922
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
look,

923
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I mean,

924
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
in most cases,

925
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
not all,

926
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
but basic

927
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
functionality is

928
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
that it's

929
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
some sort of

930
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
split visit,

931
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
meaning that

932
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
they are more

933
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
representative,

934
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
less interactive

935
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
pages,

936
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
of course,

937
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
there are

938
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
plugins that

939
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
you can

940
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
use,

941
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
but basically

942
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
it's a

943
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
publishing

944
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
platform,

945
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and you

946
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
publish content,

947
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
now in

948
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
what form it

949
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
is,

950
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
or,

951
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't

952
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
know,

953
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
the principle

954
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
of publishing

955
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
content is

956
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
always the

957
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
same,

958
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
meaning,

959
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
if you

960
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
have a

961
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
blog,

962
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
or you

963
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
have,

964
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I don't

965
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
know,

966
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
a landing

967
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
page

968
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
or something

969
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
like that,

970
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
so I

971
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
think it

972
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
would be

973
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
very difficult

974
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
to replicate

975
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
on some

976
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
other

977
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
systems.

978
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Well,

979
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
probably

980
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
so,

981
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
probably

982
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000

983
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000

984
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000

985
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
are

986
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
still

987
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
in the

988
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000

993
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yes,

994
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
they are

995
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000

1456
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,200
who told me that I'm a permanent codable developer.

1457
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,200
And that took a long time.

1458
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,600
We even made a poster for it.

1459
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,000
We signed it with Per,

1460
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Certified Codable Developer.

1461
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And that was it.

1462
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
When he came to the conference, he mentioned it to me.

1463
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And that was a great pleasure for me.

1464
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So, Certified Codable was based on the satisfaction of the website?

1465
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
That's right.

1466
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And not on the fact that you would go and review whatever was done.

1467
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We only went through the vetting process,

1468
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
to see if he had a technical task.

1469
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Otherwise, we didn't go to look at anything.

1470
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
When he was vetting,

1471
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
he had 10, 15, 20 projects in mind for those three months.

1472
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And then we saw that the average score was 4.7,

1473
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
which is very good.

1474
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And most of them had very high scores,

1475
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
which we had already cut off.

1476
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
If there was one, everyone would do it.

1477
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But when I got five for the first time,

1478
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
then something went wrong.

1479
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And then they flew out of the system.

1480
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Did something happen?

1481
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Or is there a situation where the other side with a developer

1482
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
is doing very well,

1483
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and says,

1484
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
hey, let's go down from the platform,

1485
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and we'll do it without you.

1486
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
That happened a lot.

1487
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
But the developers started,

1488
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
let's call it a start in the business.

1489
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
The start was a lot from the point of view of the side.

1490
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
But we were so focused on the happiness of our developers,

1491
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
that they returned us with loyalty.

1492
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And we knew, for example,

1493
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
he came and said,

1494
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
listen, we want to start.

1495
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Then we clicked on the side, local account.

1496
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Look, we won't work anymore.

1497
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I mean, we can work well on the account.

1498
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That's how it is.

1499
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
There must be some rules,

1500
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
written or not.

1501
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And a lot happened.

1502
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Let's say we saw that the developer was working like this.

1503
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It all happened in half a year.

1504
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
For the same side.

1505
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And listen, we talked to the side.

1506
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And maybe Mika would work exclusively for them,

1507
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
to hire me.

1508
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And then we switched sides,

1509
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and we had a meeting live on Skype.

1510
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So we're talking now.

1511
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Okay, we're live now.

1512
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And the side said,

1513
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
yes, we would hire him, up and down.

1514
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Okay, if we do this,

1515
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
then no problem in the future.

1516
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We're not total pussies.

1517
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I mean, if he's working through,

1518
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
you can't look down on him.

1519
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's not fair in the end.

1520
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We put him on his feet.

1521
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
We gave him a lot.

1522
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
We also had a lot of contrast from them.

1523
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Okay, because of that,

1524
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
a correct attitude.

1525
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And it also happened that a developer

1526
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
came in two years ago.

1527
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
He said, we don't have the end of the project.

1528
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Or the company went bankrupt.

1529
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Whatever, we took him back.

1530
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Wait, if I understand you correctly,

1531
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
the developers were actually employed for a long time.

1532
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No.

1533
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
They are still freelancers.

1534
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You are still that platform

1535
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
that provides

1536
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the bidding

1537
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
for projects and that's it.

1538
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yes.

1539
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I have a question here.

1540
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Now...

1541
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Okay, people who are listening.

1542
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
They're watching.

1543
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
They're watching.

1544
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
People who are listening,

1545
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
probably have a question.

1546
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
If you're going to work in a tech company

1547
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
or an agency,

1548
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
it's a technical interview.

1549
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And you have to check

1550
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
some technical skills

1551
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
of the candidates.

1552
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
You could also change your career path.

1553
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes.

1554
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Tell me, maybe...

1555
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
We haven't established

1556
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
how many different companies

1557
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
you worked for before you came to Codeable.

1558
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Okay.

1559
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I guess you went...

1560
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
To get to know the process

1561
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
of a classic company.

1562
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You come in and talk.

1563
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
How different was that process

1564
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
compared to the technical recruitment

1565
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
in Codeable?

1566
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Was it close?

1567
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Was it top secret?

1568
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
No, it wasn't top secret.

1569
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I wasn't involved.

1570
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
In the beginning,

1571
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the first X was

1572
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
a gut feeling.

1573
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
To see what V is talking about.

1574
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And there was

1575
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
brute force.

1576
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
The parties are happy, good enough.

1577
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
The parties aren't happy.

1578
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
In that funnel,

1579
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
you get people in,

1580
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and through the video rating,

1581
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
you give them an opportunity to try.

1582
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yes.

1583
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
The first freelancers

1584
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I got because I published

1585
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
a fake project on the competition.

1586
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I got them, and then I

1587
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
tied them up.

1588
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
The competition probably returned you

1589
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
with the same attitudes.

1590
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I have no idea.

1591
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
They weren't you.

1592
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
They weren't successful.

1593
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It was really high.

1594
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We did have

1595
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
a technical process,

1596
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
but at that point,

1597
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
it was 4-5 years in.

1598
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I wasn't involved

1599
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
in that process anymore.

1600
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
We had employees

1601
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
who dealt with it,

1602
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
especially on customer support,

1603
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
when they were hired for it.

1604
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Now I have

1605
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
two dots here.

1606
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I love customer support.

1607
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's what I wrote.

1608
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I wrote it with all my heart.

1609
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You probably have a passion

1610
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
for customer support.

1611
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's the same thing as PHP.

1612
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Or worse.

1613
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I know a conversation

1614
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
where they wrote

1615
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
that if you have so much

1616
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
customer support,

1617
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
you went on rotation,

1618
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
learned about parties,

1619
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
problems.

1620
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Did you learn anything from it?

1621
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
This might be a topic

1622
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
that he won't want to talk about.

1623
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Wait.

1624
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I want to be...

1625
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Political correctness.

1626
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Look.

1627
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I love customer support.

1628
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Of course, I'm crazy

1629
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
about customer support

1630
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
until someone else does it.

1631
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I mean,

1632
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
the drama

1633
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
that human nature

1634
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
brings

1635
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
isn't close to my heart

1636
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
if I'm politically correct enough.

1637
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I'll tell you this.

1638
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
When you wake up in the morning

1639
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and someone writes

1640
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
that you're great as a company,

1641
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that you're doing great.

1642
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Dear listeners of this podcast,

1643
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
let me draw you

1644
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
a picture of typical support

1645
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
of the environment.

1646
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
People who are satisfied

1647
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
with their work

1648
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
don't do it.

1649
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
In short, what

1650
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
you have left on customer support

1651
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
are people who are dissatisfied.

1652
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And sometimes

1653
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
they're not satisfied

1654
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
at all,

1655
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and sometimes they're total assholes.

1656
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
With a big P and other

1657
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
lines, they call you

1658
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
and draw a line.

1659
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And no matter what you give them,

1660
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
they're not satisfied.

1661
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
And this is, for example,

1662
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
if you're more

1663
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
empathetic,

1664
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
then it

1665
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
exhausts you.

1666
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You talk to one person for three minutes

1667
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
and you're totally

1668
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
lost that day.

1669
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So,

1670
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
customer support is not for me.

1671
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
But luckily,

1672
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
what's cool,

1673
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Americans are fantastic

1674
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
at it. Then I hired

1675
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
an American,

1676
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and we hired

1677
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
a guy named David.

1678
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And David was like

1679
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
everything is awesome.

1680
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
American

1681
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
principle, yes.

1682
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And he was followed by speech forks.

1683
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
They were shameless.

1684
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And he was like, yeah, cool, we'll solve it.

1685
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And I was like, how

1686
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
do you have to do that?

1687
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And he was like, yeah,

1688
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
smile.

1689
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Do you think it's

1690
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
really solving problems,

1691
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
or do you also get some insight

1692
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
how to develop a product in the final phase

1693
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
of the company, or is it

1694
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
a myth?

1695
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
The fact is,

1696
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
you established a company

1697
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
that is Danish,

1698
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
but you worked globally.

1699
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Sometimes the pages are remote,

1700
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
sometimes the clients are remote.

1701
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
How do you develop a product

1702
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
in such an environment

1703
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
when you don't see the pages?

1704
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Is it all gut feeling or

1705
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
metrics?

1706
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You get feedback.

1707
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Before I got to Carriker,

1708
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
not all pages

1709
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
are that hardcore.

1710
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
You have a page that is told

1711
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and some don't like it.

1712
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And that's huge.

1713
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So you get

1714
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
a story,

1715
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
an idea,

1716
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
where the company could move.

1717
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We got feedback

1718
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
from our developers.

1719
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
We got feedback from everywhere.

1720
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
We met at conferences,

1721
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
we had a dedicated forum

1722
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
where we talked with them.

1723
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
We had a Discord chat.

1724
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So there was a lot of feedback

1725
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
from the developers.

1726
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
The pages also told

1727
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
what they were missing

1728
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
or what would be different.

1729
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Based on that,

1730
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
we decided

1731
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
where we would go.

1732
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's like that,

1733
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
squeaky wheel gets the grease.

1734
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
The pages were louder,

1735
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
you remember them more

1736
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and there's an additional weight

1737
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
on the features that would solve

1738
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
their problem.

1739
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I would like to

1740
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
ask you two more questions

1741
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and then we'll move on.

1742
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Go ahead.

1743
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Automatic,

1744
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
is a company

1745
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
that has a name

1746
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
WordPress.com,

1747
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
WordPress Cloud.

1748
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
They are the biggest

1749
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
commercial offer

1750
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
of WordPress products in the world.

1751
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
They are affiliated with

1752
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
the WordPress label.

1753
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Yes.

1754
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Atomic

1755
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
also invested in Codable.

1756
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Automatic.

1757
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Automatic also invested in Codable.

1758
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yes.

1759
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Tell us how did it happen?

1760
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Why did it happen?

1761
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
How did it help you?

1762
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It was like that.

1763
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
They didn't invest in itself,

1764
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
but they bought a company

1765
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
that was a co-owner of Codable.

1766
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
That means

1767
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
when we started with Codable,

1768
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
we didn't have

1769
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
anything.

1770
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
We needed

1771
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
a strategic partner

1772
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
that would offer

1773
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
their side

1774
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
or prepared parts.

1775
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
We came

1776
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
to a contact

1777
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
from a company called

1778
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
WooThemes,

1779
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
a South African company.

1780
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I sent

1781
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
a cold email.

1782
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
They didn't answer.

1783
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Then they answered.

1784
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
We started talking.

1785
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
We wanted

1786
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
a partnership with them

1787
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
because we didn't have any side.

1788
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
We are a new actor on stage.

1789
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
We started talking

1790
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and they asked

1791
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
for a partnership.

1792
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
We couldn't offer them

1793
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
any side or income.

1794
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
We could only offer them a company.

1795
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But there is a potential.

1796
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
We gave them

1797
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
3 or 5 percent.

1798
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I don't remember.

1799
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's been 10 years.

1800
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We gave them a percentage.

1801
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
When they acquired

1802
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Automatik,

1803
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
a co-owner of

1804
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
All Things WordPress,

1805
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
they bought WooThemes.

1806
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I think they

1807
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
changed their name to WooCommerce

1808
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
because it was

1809
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
their most popular plugin.

1810
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They bought WooThemes

1811
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and got a share.

1812
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
How they helped us,

1813
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
we don't know.

1814
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
At the same time

1815
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
it was a problem.

1816
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
It was more of a bragging right.

1817
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
A co-owner of

1818
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
a company called

1819
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Automatik

1820
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
has 44 percent of the shares.

1821
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But it was

1822
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
just a bragging right.

1823
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It's hard

1824
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
because of certain

1825
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
legal issues.

1826
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It brought some

1827
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
bonuses.

1828
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And also

1829
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
a strategic partner.

1830
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Yes, but

1831
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
there are also

1832
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
some egos in the back.

1833
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I won't...

1834
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
In my final phase,

1835
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
from all of us,

1836
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
those egos were

1837
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
very expensive

1838
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
and I think they could have been

1839
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
better and more...

1840
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm not talking about the acquisition,

1841
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
but overall,

1842
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I think that in every community

1843
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
there were some...

1844
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
This is related to me.

1845
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'll tell you this

1846
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
so you don't have any more questions.

1847
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Those 10 years

1848
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
of history,

1849
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
you can say

1850
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
that it was mostly business.

1851
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
What are

1852
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
those...

1853
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
How did you

1854
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
learn the most?

1855
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
What are those

1856
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
stories

1857
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
or pitfalls

1858
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
that happened

1859
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
that were

1860
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
failures?

1861
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
But they gave you

1862
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
to move forward,

1863
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
to think, to change

1864
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
mindset.

1865
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And all of that

1866
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
gave me something.

1867
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Is there something like that?

1868
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I mean...

1869
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I don't know much about it,

1870
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
but you could say

1871
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
that in the whole story

1872
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
there was

1873
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
that pitfall that

1874
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
opened my eyes, changed me

1875
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
or through that difficult

1876
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
pitfall I was able to understand.

1877
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Definitely,

1878
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
maybe financially,

1879
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
financially...

1880
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Financially,

1881
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I mean, I was very

1882
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
financially down,

1883
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
when we started

1884
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
this whole thing.

1885
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Maybe

1886
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I bring here

1887
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
in some way to all young

1888
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
entrepreneurs

1889
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
to start from zero.

1890
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Because you know much more

1891
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
every small success,

1892
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
every step forward.

1893
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You are very agile.

1894
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
At that time I was very rude.

1895
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
When we started,

1896
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
if I tell you, or I have to tell

1897
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
this story now,

1898
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
it's not too long.

1899
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I was at the bottom

1900
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
when we started Codeable,

1901
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I was in debt all the time.

1902
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And for three months

1903
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I was paying for

1904
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
car leasing.

1905
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And

1906
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
a detective came to me

1907
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and sent me home.

1908
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
A detective came to knock on the door,

1909
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I came to get rid of him.

1910
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And I got rid of the bag

1911
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
that I got from the neighbor,

1912
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
because she didn't have it with her.

1913
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And the neighbor came,

1914
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
she had Juri under her shirt,

1915
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I don't remember,

1916
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
and this detective was calling me

1917
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
to the bank, and I told him

1918
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I could put a dollar

1919
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
on the account of the bank

1920
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and then he called me home.

1921
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
He was a very friendly man,

1922
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
so he wouldn't do anything bad.

1923
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And then we kissed

1924
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and he left, and in a week

1925
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I got a bill for 400 euros for his

1926
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
bank accounts.

1927
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So low, so low,

1928
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
but I couldn't accept it,

1929
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
because I sat there and cried for two hours.

1930
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Because I didn't know, as a family provider

1931
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I totally failed

1932
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
in providing for the family.

1933
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It was very, very difficult,

1934
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
but the science,

1935
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
or whatever I was drawn to,

1936
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
is that today I know the value

1937
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
of everything, I don't know,

1938
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
partnership, knowledge,

1939
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
experience, personal growth.

1940
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Personal growth means a lot to me.

1941
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Because if I tell you

1942
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
what you know,

1943
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
we all start from scratch,

1944
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
we all are born naked.

1945
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And you can only

1946
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
save yourself when the time comes.

1947
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And at that time we believed a lot,

1948
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
even when I have to say

1949
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
that my wife is

1950
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
blaming me, or we are,

1951
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
because she said, we'll have it,

1952
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
we'll have a foundation, we'll be strong.

1953
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
These are the stories.

1954
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It's easiest

1955
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
to thank

1956
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
success,

1957
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
but success also goes fast

1958
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
in the final phase.

1959
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You know, a lot of times you're happy,

1960
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I mean, you watch

1961
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
this Instagram generation,

1962
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
because on Instagram

1963
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
you only see,

1964
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
let's say, if they're fake or not,

1965
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
maybe they're some kind of success,

1966
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and they always

1967
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
don't see the effort,

1968
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
the path,

1969
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
and all the fails,

1970
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
that someone made it.

1971
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm very sure

1972
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
that there are people who are fake,

1973
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and they are some kind of

1974
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
fake success, but I don't know,

1975
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
all these successful stories,

1976
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
and if you take only

1977
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
athletes,

1978
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
if you take only

1979
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Olympic athletes,

1980
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
there is so much dedication,

1981
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
so much effort,

1982
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
that we, as

1983
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
spectators, maybe don't see.

1984
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
We only see the same medal,

1985
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
or the one at the end.

1986
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
You know, like they say,

1987
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
you sold your part,

1988
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
you deserve it,

1989
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
but nobody sees

1990
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
the effort,

1991
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
and the path,

1992
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
that you couldn't take.

1993
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I mean,

1994
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
when you asked what is

1995
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
the takeaway,

1996
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
the fight,

1997
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
it is a fight.

1998
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I mean, everyone wants

1999
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
to put a smile face on,

2000
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and go to a party,

2001
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
but inside you don't know

2002
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
if you're going to make it or not.

2003
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
You know,

2004
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
it is a kind of overthinking,

2005
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
because you don't write it down.

2006
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And it is a

2007
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
crazy thing.

2008
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I mean, in the last 8 years,

2009
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
plus 2 years of suffering,

2010
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
even when I decided

2011
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
to sell the company,

2012
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
it wasn't easy from my point of view.

2013
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
On the one hand,

2014
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I was pregnant,

2015
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and on the other hand,

2016
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
we were sweating and bleeding.

2017
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And as a partner,

2018
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
it was hard,

2019
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
but how to start,

2020
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I don't know.

2021
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I don't have the drive,

2022
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
the drive,

2023
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and here,

2024
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
to go abroad,

2025
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the feelings are intertwined

2026
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
in the final phase,

2027
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
even if you leave the legal side,

2028
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
it can take a lot of time

2029
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
mentally.

2030
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And the wars we fight,

2031
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I think we talk too little.

2032
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I don't know,

2033
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
when I'm in other interviews,

2034
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
maybe it's just a hit,

2035
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
success, success, success.

2036
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
In fact, instead of a failure,

2037
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
it's a million.

2038
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But once you learn to keep going,

2039
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
every time you stumble,

2040
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
you get up and go,

2041
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
because if you stop,

2042
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
you stop,

2043
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
then you can't go up and down.

2044
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Try everything,

2045
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
until you try everything,

2046
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I don't know.

2047
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
This is without words.

2048
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
No.

2049
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
No.

2050
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I don't know.

2051
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
When people ask,

2052
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
what kind of format we have,

2053
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I would keep a mainline theme,

2054
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
you would help me a little back,

2055
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
if we go too deep,

2056
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
to keep that balance.

2057
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I share.

2058
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You hold, I share.

2059
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
But now you went so deep,

2060
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I don't know how to do it.

2061
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
A little up.

2062
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
We all prepared for Andra.

2063
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Now I'll interrupt you.

2064
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
One thing came out

2065
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
for a whole world,

2066
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
when I heard it,

2067
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I thought,

2068
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
bullshit.

2069
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And Yugo told me,

2070
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Yugoslav Petkovi캖,

2071
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
he said,

2072
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
that there is a saying

2073
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
in these start-up circles,

2074
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
when you need money,

2075
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
ask for advice,

2076
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
when you need advice,

2077
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
ask for money.

2078
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And it was so easy,

2079
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
easy for you to understand.

2080
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It turned out to be spot on.

2081
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Really.

2082
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
When we fought for a day,

2083
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
no, no, no,

2084
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
when we went for advice,

2085
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I'm exaggerating a little,

2086
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
but the day went by quickly.

2087
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
You can have an idea,

2088
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
but today

2089
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
we were working hard.

2090
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
We didn't need money

2091
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
more,

2092
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
but we were busy anyway.

2093
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Now we don't need it,

2094
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
because Vlada can give it to you.

2095
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
But this saying

2096
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
reminded me,

2097
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
when it was said about us,

2098
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
about all circles of money,

2099
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
or about everyone in the world,

2100
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
it's kind of state-owned.

2101
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Thank you, Yugo, for listening.

2102
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
We asked Dra쬰n before,

2103
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
what were

2104
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
your biggest fears

2105
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
when it comes to Codable,

2106
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
or maybe even now,

2107
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
in this sub-ethnic sense,

2108
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
and what are the solutions?

2109
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Probably the biggest fear

2110
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
is to come back

2111
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
to the position

2112
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
if you can't provide for your family.

2113
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
But probably

2114
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
you have a lot of fears

2115
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
and worries

2116
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
as a founder,

2117
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
as a co-founder,

2118
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
as a technical leader.

2119
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
What are your biggest,

2120
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
for example,

2121
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
if we are already like the first one.

2122
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Two.

2123
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
We, two women,

2124
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
quickly reached

2125
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
a family role.

2126
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
To be a pressure provider.

2127
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And that's

2128
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
the biggest fear,

2129
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
what if not.

2130
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I have a buffer

2131
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
that allows me

2132
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
some amount of experimentation

2133
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
or laziness,

2134
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
if you want.

2135
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So that fear.

2136
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
But it's a stupid topic.

2137
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
People miss it sometimes.

2138
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So I didn't

2139
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
get unlimited

2140
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
sales from people

2141
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
to be able to enjoy

2142
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
my whole life.

2143
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So that fear,

2144
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
how will we move forward?

2145
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I mean, how?

2146
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Will I succeed again?

2147
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I don't know, some statistics say

2148
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
that 99% of fairs fail.

2149
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And now if I have one war,

2150
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
can I have another war?

2151
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And this is directly linked

2152
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
to my second fear.

2153
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Because I had it for the first time.

2154
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Very long, very powerful.

2155
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
We call it impostor syndrome.

2156
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
When you are new somewhere,

2157
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
you have a feeling that you don't fit in.

2158
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That people are smarter than you.

2159
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
That they are more capable than you.

2160
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
So, in short,

2161
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
you have a feeling that you are

2162
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
inferior to everyone

2163
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
in the industry.

2164
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And, for example,

2165
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I know a lot about new jobs.

2166
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I'm full of research.

2167
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
But still, some people do it

2168
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
two years more than me.

2169
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And these people have a place

2170
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
for something more than me.

2171
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
But if I tell you an anecdote

2172
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
What happened?

2173
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I met my hero, so to speak.

2174
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I mean, I had a man

2175
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
who also had a startup

2176
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
for online freelancing.

2177
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And not only did we catch up with this company,

2178
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
we overtook it.

2179
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
We overtook it for a long time.

2180
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And we met a guy, and he said,

2181
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Dude, you're less like that on the inside.

2182
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And he said, Dude, you're less like that on the inside.

2183
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And you know, it's like, open your eyes,

2184
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
that we're all some lollipops at the end of the day.

2185
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
You know, when we all fight,

2186
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
we want to improve our lives and the lives of others,

2187
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
in the final phase.

2188
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And that fear, that impostor syndrome,

2189
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
which I now have again, on hardcore,

2190
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I mean, those ends are just before the sale,

2191
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
as they say, at the time of recording this.

2192
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And I have a lot of, you know,

2193
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
what if it doesn't go well,

2194
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
you know, I mean, I'm really torn.

2195
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It's like two years, again,

2196
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and things, positive things,

2197
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
because of which I don't sleep.

2198
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I mean, I'm getting into something new.

2199
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
But again, it's just eating me up, you know.

2200
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I still believe that when a few of them are sold,

2201
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
there will be a review, and they will say,

2202
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Wow, look, I have this up and down.

2203
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
But now it's crazy.

2204
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I'd hide in a closet, but it's like,

2205
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
yeah, I have this syndrome.

2206
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I totally understand.

2207
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I mean, I totally, totally understand.

2208
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
No, but, you know,

2209
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
do you have, like,

2210
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
in a practical world,

2211
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
how do you prevent, or,

2212
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
that this thing doesn't eat you up,

2213
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
the impostor syndrome?

2214
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Do you rush forward?

2215
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
No, I mean, do you rush forward?

2216
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I don't have, like,

2217
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I don't have my heroes, you know.

2218
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It gives you, or,

2219
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
how do you say, write it with your heroes, right?

2220
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Because you will meet them.

2221
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
For example, if you're in the same job,

2222
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
you will meet your heroes, so to speak.

2223
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Because you go to the same conference,

2224
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
they repeat, you know,

2225
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
topics are intended, or other network events,

2226
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
you meet them.

2227
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And I mean, what happened to me,

2228
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
is that when you meet them,

2229
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
you realize that they are all so bloody under the skin,

2230
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and they have totally identical

2231
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
problems and happiness,

2232
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and the same things meet them,

2233
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and the same fears, and so on.

2234
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And the same mindset.

2235
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
And in the end, you realize that you have

2236
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
become more friendly to people

2237
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
than to some

2238
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
inferior being, right?

2239
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So, you know,

2240
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
go to those people,

2241
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
get to know them, and you will see that.

2242
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
But, I mean, because I haven't met those people yet

2243
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
in the world of typesetters,

2244
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I still have, and I believe that I will go

2245
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
through that, for example, when, I don't know,

2246
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
the sale will take place, and people will be happy,

2247
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I will get to know them,

2248
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
but I'm not there yet.

2249
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I'll drink a glass of water,

2250
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I'm going to turn this side now.

2251
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Right, right.

2252
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's not an empty glass, look.

2253
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It was half empty, wait.

2254
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Okay.

2255
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Look, um...

2256
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Now, um...

2257
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And you just made such a flowchart

2258
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
diagram, how good.

2259
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I like that you're getting ready for that.

2260
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
For me, right?

2261
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

2262
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Look, um...

2263
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I hope that those who

2264
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
saw YouTube

2265
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
with your typesetter,

2266
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
that they will forgive us because we went

2267
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
full Codable, and maybe full Excited

2268
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
are waiting for us to talk about typesetters.

2269
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Okay. But I wanted to first tell

2270
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
what Codable is,

2271
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
because I wanted to somehow tell the story.

2272
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Who are you, where do you come from,

2273
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
what is your relationship to technology,

2274
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
where does that passion come from.

2275
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Um...

2276
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And now...

2277
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
The next chapter I'm going to talk about

2278
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
is typesetters.

2279
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah.

2280
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And...

2281
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Now, is it about typesetters,

2282
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
or about typesetters?

2283
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We'll talk about... Which direction are we going to turn?

2284
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
First, I mean, first we have to talk logically

2285
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
about typesetters, so we can fit that part

2286
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
in, but...

2287
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I would say, first of all,

2288
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
both of us love to work

2289
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
in a virtual world.

2290
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
You also come from

2291
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Codable, which is basically

2292
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
in the air, right?

2293
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And then,

2294
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
today we are in our own world,

2295
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
we are fully virtual,

2296
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
as a programmer, as someone else,

2297
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and it's really

2298
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
a good feeling

2299
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
when you take some physical lessons

2300
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and today you brought us this typewriter,

2301
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
the typewriter has two keys,

2302
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
and it's a really

2303
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
beautiful piece, aesthetically,

2304
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
and it has its sound,

2305
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and it has its color,

2306
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
and it has, you know,

2307
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
a physical product,

2308
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
and it's a good feeling when you take it

2309
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
in your hands and it's really congratulations to you.

2310
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Thank you.

2311
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I know it's such a premium product that

2312
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
maybe our listeners and viewers

2313
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
won't see it, if they don't really come,

2314
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
and then you'll do a great job, right?

2315
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
But it's really impressive,

2316
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
if you ever see this piece,

2317
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
try it, you'll see the difference.

2318
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
When you brought it,

2319
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
we also put it on the table with the Chinese,

2320
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I think, and with some other typewriter,

2321
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
the difference is very obvious.

2322
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I don't know if I'll ever try it,

2323
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I don't try it, but

2324
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
it's impressive, so thank you.

2325
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Now, at the end of this debate,

2326
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I won't

2327
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
go too deep,

2328
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
because you made

2329
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
a really great intro in the typewriter itself,

2330
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I'll put a link below,

2331
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
so people can watch it.

2332
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Also, there's so much passion

2333
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and love in this video,

2334
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
that I can't get closer

2335
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
to my perspective,

2336
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
but I'll try it anyway,

2337
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
so forgive me

2338
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
and also the dog for doing this.

2339
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
No problem.

2340
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I would go through a process

2341
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
that you went through,

2342
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and I would...

2343
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I would prefer you

2344
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
to go through the process,

2345
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I would ask you directly,

2346
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
why the fetish of the typewriter?

2347
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I mean, can I say

2348
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
about the fetish?

2349
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yes, absolutely.

2350
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
You're not...

2351
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I mean,

2352
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
your passion

2353
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
was seen

2354
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
and heard,

2355
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
how you express it,

2356
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
but now,

2357
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
why exactly

2358
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
the typewriter?

2359
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I don't know. My ex-boyfriend decided

2360
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
that he's crazy about it.

2361
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I don't have an explanation.

2362
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
But you bought a dog, right?

2363
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yes, no, that was...

2364
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I mean, here's the whole story.

2365
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I didn't get it.

2366
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I solve my own problem.

2367
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
That was in 2018.

2368
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I was in America,

2369
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
and I brought

2370
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
a top-of-the-line PC,

2371
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
with the components you bought there.

2372
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
It was so amazing.

2373
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I think I bought it

2374
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
in a cheap store,

2375
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and I bought it

2376
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
for 15 euros,

2377
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
which is a bit more expensive.

2378
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
No go.

2379
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Apple keyboard is a bit more expensive.

2380
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You know,

2381
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
everything is so soft.

2382
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It's like aluminum.

2383
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah,

2384
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
it's still flimsy.

2385
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Aluminum is also cellophane.

2386
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I mean, not cellophane,

2387
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
that foil.

2388
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
In short,

2389
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I couldn't buy it.

2390
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Even today,

2391
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
my demands were not met.

2392
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
For a lot of things,

2393
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
something is missing.

2394
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But in the end,

2395
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I couldn't focus on both sides

2396
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
because

2397
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
first of all,

2398
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I wanted to have a smaller format,

2399
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
like Mono.

2400
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
For those who don't know,

2401
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
my keyboard is called Mono.

2402
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I think that doesn't mean much.

2403
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
When I say Mono,

2404
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I mean my own keyboard.

2405
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I wanted it to be all aluminum,

2406
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
no plastic.

2407
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I mean, it's plastic,

2408
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it doesn't matter.

2409
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Now I'm waiting for ceramic keys.

2410
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
My wife doesn't have one,

2411
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
so I'll get a ceramic one tomorrow.

2412
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2413
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
We have a brick.

2414
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
No, wait, wait.

2415
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
What's ceramic?

2416
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Sticks.

2417
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Ceramic sticks?

2418
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Yeah, sticks are fully ceramic.

2419
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I mean, ceramic sticks.

2420
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
And they're very soft.

2421
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Proper sticks, not gimmicks.

2422
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
It's a kickstarter.

2423
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Is it custom-made?

2424
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
No, no, it's standard.

2425
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
The sticks are standard.

2426
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Cherry MX made the standard

2427
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and they stick to it.

2428
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
The sticks have different profiles.

2429
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Profile is the height.

2430
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
But the sticks

2431
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
that you put on the glass

2432
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
are all MX.

2433
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And you're right,

2434
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
it was a kickstarter project

2435
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
where I supported it and ordered

2436
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
two sets of ceramic sticks

2437
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
because it's for two printers.

2438
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Yeah, two sets.

2439
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
The set is for one printer.

2440
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Where did I stop?

2441
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
65% format,

2442
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
fully aluminum,

2443
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
so it's heavy, so it doesn't move

2444
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
around, so there's no branding.

2445
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I hate overbranding.

2446
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Well, not overbranding,

2447
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
but this.

2448
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Like an apple or something.

2449
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
No, no, no.

2450
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
There's branding, but at the bottom

2451
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
there's a logo.

2452
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's timeless.

2453
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It's modular.

2454
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I can change the shape

2455
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
of the stick

2456
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
and the inside stays the same.

2457
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
So you can

2458
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
mix and match

2459
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
in the long run.

2460
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Do I want to offer it?

2461
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
No, it has a 10-year warranty.

2462
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It will work for sure for 10 years.

2463
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
If the connection,

2464
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
for example,

2465
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
is aluminum,

2466
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
it will work.

2467
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I wanted

2468
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
from all the functional aspects

2469
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
that it's top.

2470
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
That's why I wanted to do it myself

2471
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
because I didn't get it.

2472
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
People

2473
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
are mostly enthusiastic

2474
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
because they go through

2475
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
group buy.

2476
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
But now you have a big problem.

2477
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
You put a group buy out

2478
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
and you have to wait

2479
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
because of shortages, war in Ukraine,

2480
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
all the global problems.

2481
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Because of the situation in the world.

2482
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You wait a year and a half, two.

2483
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Last year in August I got

2484
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
sticks that I waited

2485
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
for two years and a month.

2486
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
These are sticks

2487
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
for which I paid 400 euros

2488
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
for two sets.

2489
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
It's not for the price.

2490
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
It's for 1000 sets,

2491
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
which was very little globally.

2492
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And it's so expensive to wait so long.

2493
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Now I have 50 sticks in the warehouse,

2494
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
in the warehouse,

2495
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
but I don't have any now.

2496
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Now it's the same.

2497
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
If there are two problems

2498
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
in this fetish.

2499
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Is it

2500
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
something you press on?

2501
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
No offense.

2502
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Do you watch

2503
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
when you put it on the shelf

2504
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
and light it up with lights

2505
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
and say it's art?

2506
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
No, I mean, the design is already

2507
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
in the bag,

2508
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
but you represent some kind of

2509
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
masterpiece.

2510
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I understand what you want to say

2511
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and that's what you press on.

2512
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I'm fully

2513
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
attached to

2514
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
quality stuff

2515
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
that you use.

2516
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
If I had a Kenix or Maserati

2517
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
or something,

2518
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I wouldn't drive it day and night.

2519
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's not for me.

2520
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Even the watch

2521
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
that I bought,

2522
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I have it on my hands.

2523
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's not for looking.

2524
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And I'm the same for this coin.

2525
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It's for using.

2526
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It's to make you look better every day.

2527
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Because of the use,

2528
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
because of the feedback on your fingers,

2529
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
when you gently press your fingers

2530
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
when you rest.

2531
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That's its advantage.

2532
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
It's nice for me

2533
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
because I designed it myself,

2534
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
but it's not for looking at the police.

2535
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's the use.

2536
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
It's a tool.

2537
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
A tool that brings me

2538
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
luck.

2539
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I have

2540
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
an audio system

2541
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
of a higher price

2542
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
and a higher quality.

2543
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
That's why I enjoy it.

2544
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I listen to music a lot.

2545
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I immerse myself for hours

2546
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
in my work and I have headphones.

2547
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
It's important to me that the headphones are quality

2548
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
and that the monitor is quality

2549
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
and that the ride is on a good table.

2550
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Thank God I'm in a position

2551
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
where I can use these things

2552
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
because the experience of using all these tools is important to me.

2553
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I'm not there

2554
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
to put it on the wall.

2555
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
On the wall I have

2556
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
a canvas

2557
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
of a sprint.

2558
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
No.

2559
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I don't know how much

2560
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
our audience knows

2561
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
about the culture or subculture

2562
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
of printers.

2563
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I know that there is a link

2564
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
to the mechanical keyboard

2565
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
on Reddit.

2566
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
You just look at it

2567
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
and wonder about the aesthetics and design

2568
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
of what people do with these printers.

2569
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
How much love

2570
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
and passion is poured into it

2571
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
and it's really impressive

2572
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
what people do with these printers.

2573
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I'll ask you a simple question

2574
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
and you'll probably

2575
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
fall for it.

2576
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
What's the point of these printers?

2577
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
That's it.

2578
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
What's the point of these printers?

2579
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You just press

2580
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
and it clicks.

2581
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
If I'm smart,

2582
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I'll go back.

2583
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
The point of a printer

2584
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
is to make an electric click

2585
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
when you press it.

2586
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That's what I wanted to say.

2587
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
That's what a printer is.

2588
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
When I've tried

2589
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
hundreds

2590
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
of them,

2591
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I personally like

2592
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
tactile printers

2593
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
because

2594
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
they have

2595
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
an obstacle

2596
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
or a bump

2597
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
through which

2598
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
it has to go.

2599
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
That's why it feels like

2600
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
it wants to stop.

2601
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
But when it goes through,

2602
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
it goes back.

2603
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
It's like a stick.

2604
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You don't have to press it all the way.

2605
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
That's the difference between linear printers

2606
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
and tactile printers.

2607
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Linear printers always have to go all the way

2608
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
because you don't know where the stick

2609
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
is going to end up.

2610
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Tactile printers

2611
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
give you feedback.

2612
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
That's what I like

2613
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
about tactile printers.

2614
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Gamers prefer linear printers.

2615
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
That's why I have more tactile printers.

2616
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
You know,

2617
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
when I'm gaming with my colleagues,

2618
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I prefer linear printers

2619
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
because you can press it all the way.

2620
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
That's the thing.

2621
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
You switch between tactile printers

2622
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and now we're in a different context.

2623
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Now we're gaming.

2624
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
We've had

2625
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
in our

2626
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
co-working in Hackerspace

2627
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
a colleague

2628
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
who also had a passion

2629
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
for tactile printers.

2630
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
We really liked him

2631
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
but there was a silence

2632
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
when he went out of the office

2633
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
with a tactile printer.

2634
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
It was good because

2635
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
tactile printers can become very loud

2636
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and very fluid.

2637
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Some of them

2638
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
sound like a typewriter

2639
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
but...

2640
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It should get loud, right?

2641
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You have silent linear

2642
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
and silent tactile.

2643
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
They're both silent.

2644
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It's still the same type of printer

2645
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
except for the silence

2646
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
and then they don't make

2647
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
any sound at all.

2648
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
It's so small that

2649
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Apple's Mac keyboard

2650
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
is much louder than

2651
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
the silence.

2652
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Silence is just a rubber band

2653
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
around the track

2654
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
or something like that

2655
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
and around it

2656
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
there's a rubber band

2657
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
like a jacket

2658
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and when it comes down

2659
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
it's a rubber band

2660
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and when it comes up

2661
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
it's a rubber band again.

2662
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I don't think the sound

2663
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
is as important as the feeling

2664
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
of shaking.

2665
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I use a special lubricant

2666
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
on a Teflon basis

2667
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
to lubricate my device.

2668
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Because the part where

2669
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
the plastic is shaking

2670
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
is more pleasant.

2671
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
It's not like a sound

2672
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
but it flows smoothly

2673
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
up and down.

2674
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
It doesn't mean anything to someone

2675
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
because it's good enough

2676
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and it doesn't mean

2677
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
a bus or a thousand other

2678
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
excuses.

2679
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I press the keyboard

2680
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
10, 12, 14 hours a day

2681
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
and it's an important feeling.

2682
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Your keyboard comes as a kit

2683
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
that you can put together.

2684
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I would say that part of

2685
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
the passion of a person

2686
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
is to put the keyboard together.

2687
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
That's right.

2688
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
You mentioned cars

2689
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and you also have

2690
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
a manual part for a car.

2691
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Yes, you used to have a box

2692
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
where you put the car together.

2693
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Where does

2694
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
the audiophilia come from?

2695
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
You can put the cables

2696
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
on the back

2697
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
but you won't put

2698
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
the equipment together.

2699
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Ideally, you buy a nice

2700
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
high-quality product.

2701
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Where does

2702
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
the passion

2703
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
come from?

2704
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
You buy a kit

2705
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and then you say

2706
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
where you can put it together.

2707
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Simply put,

2708
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
there are stickers in the game.

2709
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Stickers are the ones

2710
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
that give

2711
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
the biggest signature

2712
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
to a keyboard player.

2713
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Every one of us

2714
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
has our own passion.

2715
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
When I buy a keyboard

2716
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I don't want someone

2717
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
to give me a sticker

2718
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
for which he or she decided.

2719
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
There are many different stickers

2720
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and you can try them.

2721
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It's the same with keys.

2722
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I gave this group buy

2723
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
12 sets of keys

2724
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
with different color combinations

2725
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
for different applications.

2726
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I want to have

2727
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
my own combination.

2728
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I don't want

2729
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
someone to steal it from me.

2730
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
That's why I've never bought

2731
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
a keyboard that already has it.

2732
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I prefer to buy a kit.

2733
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
There's another reason

2734
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
which is logistic.

2735
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I can't sell

2736
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
a keyboard

2737
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
plug-and-play

2738
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
without a CE certificate

2739
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
for which you need

2740
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
a CE certificate.

2741
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
In Ljubljana

2742
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
you don't need a CE certificate

2743
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
and it costs you

2744
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
more than 1000 EUR

2745
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
to get a CE certificate

2746
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
so you can sell it

2747
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
as a consumer electronics.

2748
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
But that wasn't

2749
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
the motivation.

2750
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I would give a CE certificate

2751
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
but it wouldn't pay off.

2752
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I have 50 keyboards

2753
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
at home

2754
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and I will decide

2755
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
how to sell them

2756
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
and how to sell them.

2757
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I have an idea for a million

2758
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
for a better keyboard.

2759
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
A different format.

2760
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Mono 2.0?

2761
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
No, Mono Max.

2762
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
A lot of people

2763
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
ask me about the service.

2764
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I would like to have more

2765
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
than I need in the US.

2766
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Mono Max is already

2767
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
made.

2768
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
But I will have to

2769
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
order more

2770
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
to see if I survive

2771
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
in the end.

2772
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I have a full keyboard

2773
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
which I made myself.

2774
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
But I would have to

2775
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
test it.

2776
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
In the first series

2777
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I invested 50 000 EUR.

2778
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
If I don't count

2779
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
minutes of my time.

2780
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Direct cash.

2781
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Now I have to sell it

2782
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
to see if I can

2783
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
get all the money back

2784
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and fail there.

2785
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Or if it's a successful job.

2786
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
But this job

2787
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
is still very

2788
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
niche and limited.

2789
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
It's not

2790
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
mass production.

2791
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The goal is not mass production.

2792
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
The price is also

2793
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
approximate.

2794
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I don't have a plan.

2795
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I would like to lower

2796
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
the price.

2797
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
But it will be

2798
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
a compromise.

2799
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I have a lot of difficulties.

2800
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Tomas, let's do something.

2801
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
But it's a compromise.

2802
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
It's hard for me.

2803
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Look.

2804
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Let me see.

2805
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
When I open the box

2806
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
inside are

2807
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
components.

2808
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I don't need a button or a switch.

2809
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I bring my switch

2810
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
and buttons

2811
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
that I like.

2812
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Then I have to assemble it.

2813
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I have to solder it.

2814
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Is it a practice in this industry?

2815
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Yes, it's a practice.

2816
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
High-end products are usually sold

2817
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
as kits. It can be already assembled.

2818
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
But you have to take it apart

2819
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
so you can

2820
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
put it all together.

2821
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
If it's assembled, it's usually

2822
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
because of shipping, because the volume is smaller.

2823
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Not because

2824
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
it would be a plug-and-play.

2825
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Wait, I heard that

2826
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
you have to fly.

2827
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
You have to fly.

2828
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
You had an assumption.

2829
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Yes, I had an assumption

2830
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
that this part is solved.

2831
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
That it's a practice.

2832
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It's hard for everyone.

2833
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You have to fly.

2834
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
For example, on mine

2835
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
there are 68 buttons.

2836
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
That's 136

2837
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
points for flying.

2838
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Everyone has two.

2839
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Plus caps lock.

2840
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Multiply it by 62 if you

2841
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
put the LEDs up, because PCB

2842
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
supports

2843
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
underglow LEDs.

2844
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
That means that

2845
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
every button has pins

2846
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
for LEDs.

2847
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
If I put

2848
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
for example

2849
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
20-30% more

2850
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
for this part

2851
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
to be assembled,

2852
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
do you think you'll be able to fly?

2853
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I can do that.

2854
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I'll give it to my kid.

2855
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
He'll be so happy.

2856
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It's a student's job.

2857
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
She'll paint the candles,

2858
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
fly, and earn something.

2859
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I don't do that.

2860
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
The approximate price is a few euros.

2861
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I tried to fly a few times.

2862
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Andra is great.

2863
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
He might be able to help.

2864
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But I won't fly for Juri Tipkovnick

2865
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
without experience.

2866
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Why not?

2867
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
That's the best entry-level.

2868
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
To fly a glass

2869
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
on a through-hole.

2870
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Now those who listen

2871
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
know what a through-hole is.

2872
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
How hard

2873
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
will it be for the customer

2874
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
to assemble it?

2875
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Nothing.

2876
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
The whole audience

2877
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
should know

2878
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
that they have a

2879
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
spiker at home.

2880
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
A through-hole is

2881
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
connected to a hole

2882
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
and through it you can see a line.

2883
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Everything you need

2884
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
is connected to that line.

2885
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
And the price is...

2886
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
That's shit.

2887
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I'll screw it up.

2888
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
My dog

2889
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
will fix it.

2890
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
It's not easy.

2891
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
But it's the basis.

2892
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
My son will be 5 years old

2893
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
and he'll enjoy it.

2894
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
We'll fly together,

2895
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
assemble it.

2896
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
He'll enjoy it

2897
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
when we assemble

2898
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
the SSAVs, video recorders, etc.

2899
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,560
We are still in the phase of distribution, but maybe we'll get there.

2900
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,840
Maybe I'll wait a little longer to lower the prices and then we'll do it.

2901
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,840
What do I have to write under this video?

2902
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,360
I want a printer.

2903
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,960
Where do I put this?

2904
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,959
Isn't that already a meme?

2905
01:40:16,959 --> 01:40:21,440
No, it will be now, but this video will be deleted from Zuni, or this podcast.

2906
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,440
Where do I spread this?

2907
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,639
No.

2908
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:26,639
I mean, you still have an opportunity.

2909
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:34,320
Now I had a funnel here, but since we've been here for a long time, I'll try a few more of these segments.

2910
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,360
Drawing. You drew in AutoCAD Fusion.

2911
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,360
Yes, Autodesk.

2912
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:43,840
You wanted to sketch it, but you realized that Fusion wasn't the best, it was simpler.

2913
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,840
No, I used AutoCAD Fusion directly.

2914
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,840
You used AutoCAD Fusion for that.

2915
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:48,959
Yes.

2916
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:56,480
Now, when I talked to you, you said AutoCAD Fusion, completely simple, purely trivial, you already have that.

2917
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:04,800
You forgot to say that your parents have a studio at home, and that you are also a high school art student.

2918
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,800
That data is also missing.

2919
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,040
Okay, you know what, it's been a long time ago.

2920
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,040
But yes.

2921
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:24,400
I grew up, well, a little bit, because I always, since I grew up, that I somehow appeared in public life, I'm an IT guy.

2922
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,400
I'm known as an IT guy.

2923
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,400
I grew up in the Aluminium factory in Ljubljana.

2924
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,400
And those problems were very close to me.

2925
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:35,760
At that time, I was still working in an engineering high school, here in our town, in Ljubljana.

2926
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:41,199
And yes, I really grew up with Aluminium, since I was a kid.

2927
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:43,199
My father had a studio in Ljubljana, unfortunately, he passed away.

2928
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:53,040
My mother retired, so my sister took over, so I still have a stick, or I don't know, if anyone wants to go to Ljubljana to see it, I sing in the summer, and then we go to Ljubljana.

2929
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:57,040
And you can see there what 600 degrees of Aluminium is there.

2930
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:03,440
Well, that's such a tiny detail that we all have to look at, so people don't think that a WordPress developer has done it, a typist.

2931
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I would have said it later.

2932
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Sorry, I'm certifying this time.

2933
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I would have said it later.

2934
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
A printer is basically a very simple product.

2935
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Too simple, I said it wrong.

2936
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Basic in the form, in the sense of geometry.

2937
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
It's not nuclear physics.

2938
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
In English, we call it a wedge.

2939
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
A wedge.

2940
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
A wedge with printers.

2941
01:42:30,559 --> 01:42:34,559
A wedge in a basic form.

2942
01:42:34,559 --> 01:42:40,559
And in AutoCAD or any 3D program, it's very, I don't know.

2943
01:42:40,559 --> 01:42:50,559
Because in Fusion or Solidworks, Lada engines and rockets that fly on Mars are projected.

2944
01:42:50,559 --> 01:42:56,559
So a wedge in that sense is not something complex.

2945
01:42:57,119 --> 01:43:05,119
As far as you know, from the basic school of Thloris, Naris and Stransky Rys, you have a very good starting point.

2946
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:07,119
So this is it. 600 opportunities.

2947
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:09,119
So you don't need it, do you?

2948
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:13,119
I'm preparing another product.

2949
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,119
In which I will not say anything yet.

2950
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:17,119
Which is not a printer.

2951
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:21,119
But I will use it on my YouTube channel from scratch.

2952
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:23,679
I made a wedge.

2953
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:25,679
I will try to condense it.

2954
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,679
The whole product from the start.

2955
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:29,679
We will go to CNC.

2956
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:31,679
We will go to eluxation.

2957
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,679
Everything will be filmed.

2958
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:35,679
The same process.

2959
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,679
And it will be the same process as with the printers.

2960
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,679
Just another product.

2961
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:41,679
Until the end.

2962
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,679
And then I will give it to someone.

2963
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:45,679
And it will be a very productive product.

2964
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:47,679
Great. English or Slovenian?

2965
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,679
I'm still studying.

2966
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,240
Yeah, I'll see.

2967
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,240
I speak English, but I'll see.

2968
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,240
Now I'm working on a build guide for Mono.

2969
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,240
In English.

2970
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,240
And I'll see how people will respond.

2971
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,240
And how they will subscribe.

2972
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:04,240
And what the metrics will be.

2973
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:06,240
Then I will decide.

2974
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,240
Yes, it is known that it will be in English.

2975
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,240
But it will really start.

2976
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,240
And people will see what kind of product to make.

2977
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,240
What is the thought process.

2978
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:16,239
Who are the masters.

2979
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:18,239
Everything will be shown.

2980
01:44:18,799 --> 01:44:20,799
And how CNC works.

2981
01:44:20,799 --> 01:44:22,799
I would like to breathe

2982
01:44:22,799 --> 01:44:24,799
the generation of makers.

2983
01:44:24,799 --> 01:44:26,799
Because for us,

2984
01:44:26,799 --> 01:44:28,799
this lack

2985
01:44:28,799 --> 01:44:30,799
was the motivation for the YouTube channel.

2986
01:44:30,799 --> 01:44:32,799
To be able to show

2987
01:44:32,799 --> 01:44:34,799
that it is possible.

2988
01:44:34,799 --> 01:44:36,799
That we are going to research.

2989
01:44:36,799 --> 01:44:38,799
It has always been close to

2990
01:44:38,799 --> 01:44:40,799
younger generations.

2991
01:44:40,799 --> 01:44:42,799
I enjoyed it a lot.

2992
01:44:42,799 --> 01:44:44,799
I remember

2993
01:44:44,799 --> 01:44:46,799
when I was in school.

2994
01:44:47,359 --> 01:44:49,359
I went to the computer class.

2995
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:51,359
And I went to school

2996
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:53,359
in the order of a circle.

2997
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:55,359
I enjoyed it a lot.

2998
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:57,359
And I think that this knowledge

2999
01:44:57,359 --> 01:44:59,359
or the sharing of this knowledge.

3000
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:01,359
After 40 years I will be old.

3001
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:03,359
I think I have already accumulated

3002
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:05,359
some knowledge in those 40 years.

3003
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:07,359
And I want to pass it on.

3004
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:13,359
Do you realize that

3005
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:15,359
all the younger generations

3006
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,920
and your generation

3007
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,920
have a desire

3008
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,920
to hear this.

3009
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,920
Or is it like

3010
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,920
we are only interested in the final product.

3011
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,920
Because it is too fast.

3012
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,920
It is not instant gratification.

3013
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,920
That's right.

3014
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,920
I think this is our task.

3015
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,920
To inspire them.

3016
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,920
That they will be interested.

3017
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,920
It is not necessary to advise.

3018
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,920
It is not necessary to advise.

3019
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,920
But I think this is our task.

3020
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,480
Because for this instant gratification

3021
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,480
we are to blame.

3022
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,480
If you ask me.

3023
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,480
Because for you or for me

3024
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,480
it is easier

3025
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,480
for a child to give you a signal

3026
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,480
that you are thinking about something else.

3027
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,480
You give him a phone.

3028
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,480
I am to blame.

3029
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,480
And if a child will see me

3030
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,480
as I am inspired

3031
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,480
it is not necessary

3032
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,480
to have the same hobbies.

3033
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,480
But my role as a parent

3034
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,040
as a teacher for a child

3035
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,040
is to inspire him.

3036
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,040
And I think it is possible

3037
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,040
if we will show them

3038
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,040
through some magic

3039
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,040
that they are in awe.

3040
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,040
You can also see

3041
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,040
what teachers their children work with.

3042
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,040
Those who inspire them

3043
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,040
interactively.

3044
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,040
Those who make them out of themselves.

3045
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,040
Those who are not a heavy authority

3046
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,040
but colleagues, motivators.

3047
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,040
We miss that a lot.

3048
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,600
I wanted to ask

3049
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,600
if he works for Mac

3050
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,600
and for Linux and Windows.

3051
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,600
He does.

3052
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,600
He does.

3053
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,600
If he is allowed to type on it.

3054
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,600
Yes.

3055
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,600
Let me take

3056
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,600
a few more of those.

3057
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,600
Prototyping.

3058
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,600
OK.

3059
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,600
In Fusion

3060
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,600
you made a 3D model.

3061
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,160
Did you 3D print it?

3062
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,160
No.

3063
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,160
How did you come to the shape

3064
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:18,160
you have now?

3065
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,160
OK.

3066
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:24,160
As I said, I will be older by 40.

3067
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,160
If I can.

3068
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,160
By 40 you already have a reflection

3069
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,160
where you are good

3070
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,160
and what you are missing.

3071
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,160
And again

3072
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,160
I miss it a lot.

3073
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,720
But I am good at two things.

3074
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,720
Accumulation of knowledge.

3075
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,720
Learning new things is too easy for me.

3076
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,720
If I am interested in something.

3077
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,720
If I am not, then fuck no.

3078
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,720
And the other thing is

3079
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,720
that I know how to surround myself

3080
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,720
with more capable people than me.

3081
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,720
Or let's say those who complement me.

3082
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,720
It sounds romantic

3083
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,720
but so far I have always liked it.

3084
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,720
Luckily.

3085
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,720
When I need someone

3086
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,720
I know who to call

3087
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:09,279
I met someone who knows someone else

3088
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:11,279
who can recommend someone to me

3089
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:13,279
and I came to that person.

3090
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:15,279
And specifically

3091
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:17,279
I didn't work directly

3092
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:19,279
on CNC.

3093
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:21,279
But I called a few fairs

3094
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:23,279
and they all gave me pre-calculations

3095
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:25,279
that my head hurts

3096
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:27,279
because they didn't know

3097
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:29,279
what to do.

3098
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:31,279
And I understand them.

3099
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:33,280
I don't ignore them.

3100
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,280
They work a hundred thousand hair

3101
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,840
and it's their dream.

3102
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,840
But then

3103
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,840
we were at the seaside for a year

3104
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,840
and our kids were playing

3105
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,840
with other kids at the seaside.

3106
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,840
And then we became friends

3107
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,840
and one thing led to another

3108
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,840
and we became even older friends.

3109
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,840
And it turned out that the father

3110
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,840
of those kids we met

3111
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
is a traveler for a large Slovenian company

3112
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,840
that sells machines and tools.

3113
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,840
And when I realized

3114
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,840
that I need to make a prototype

3115
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,400
I called him and asked

3116
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,400
if he knows someone

3117
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,400
who has CNC so accessible

3118
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,400
that it's not too big

3119
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,400
and he said yes.

3120
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,400
He has a connection with Bo코tjan

3121
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,400
who is my colleague today

3122
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,400
from Sevnica

3123
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,400
who made a prototype for me.

3124
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,400
You don't see that today.

3125
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,400
It's a rarity.

3126
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,400
And then I needed Eloxeria

3127
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,400
and Bo코tjan, the one who makes machines with CNC

3128
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,400
and he said yes.

3129
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,960
He works for Porsche, for Audi

3130
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,960
he works for such a world-class company

3131
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,960
when it comes to Eloxeria.

3132
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,960
It doesn't matter how much it costs

3133
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,960
we will do it without compromise.

3134
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,960
I don't care.

3135
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,960
The price was the last thing on my mind.

3136
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,960
Because of the sales of the previous company

3137
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,960
I was able to invest

3138
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,960
more than one euro

3139
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,960
to see what the results are.

3140
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,960
The only thing that didn't go through

3141
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:00,960
was the pressure.

3142
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,520
It was a very low price.

3143
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,520
Is it the same problem?

3144
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,520
Are you too small?

3145
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,520
No, no, no.

3146
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,520
The price was too high.

3147
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,520
I don't know if the price was too high

3148
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,520
because he has a new question.

3149
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,520
They can't afford it.

3150
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,520
For this particular company

3151
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,520
I didn't decide.

3152
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,520
It was four times more expensive

3153
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,520
and they said they can't afford it.

3154
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,080
This is a phrase

3155
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,080
that I don't like to hear.

3156
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,080
It's not possible.

3157
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,080
This phrase often comes

3158
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,080
before someone has even tried it.

3159
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,080
It's not possible.

3160
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,080
It's a defensive mechanism.

3161
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,080
I don't buy it.

3162
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,080
For such potential business partners

3163
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,080
it's very fast.

3164
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,080
I don't know about the pressure

3165
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,080
in the press.

3166
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,080
In Slovenia, when the price was 10%

3167
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,080
the pressure said

3168
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:00,640
I don't want to say this in big words

3169
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:02,640
but they said give this, give that.

3170
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,640
Everything will be fine.

3171
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:06,640
If I agreed to do

3172
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,640
no compromise

3173
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,640
when they won't even read

3174
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,640
the material that it's not fucking perfect

3175
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,640
not for me, everything will be fine.

3176
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,640
If someone told me that

3177
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,640
it's not good.

3178
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,640
Is it the best?

3179
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,640
Let's go home and have pizza.

3180
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,640
Look, look.

3181
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:30,640
It will be good today.

3182
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,640
Shit, I don't know.

3183
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,640
Packaging, marketing, sales.

3184
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,640
Ok, packaging.

3185
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,640
I didn't mention that on YouTube.

3186
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,640
Packaging, I wanted to have

3187
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,640
something like that.

3188
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,640
Ok, that's a full message.

3189
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,640
People don't see it, but all the pictures

3190
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,640
are there.

3191
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,640
I don't know how to say it.

3192
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:59,200
Anyway, packaging.

3193
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,200
I came to a man

3194
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:03,200
who designed it.

3195
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,200
The same man who designed

3196
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:07,200
packaging

3197
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:09,200
for the British queen

3198
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:11,200
who was in Slovenia.

3199
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,200
I mean,

3200
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,200
no one can do it better.

3201
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,200
Can someone tell me how to do it better?

3202
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:19,200
It's not possible.

3203
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,200
I want to tell you, I came to

3204
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,200
a man who is great.

3205
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,200
If they chose him or hired him

3206
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,760
to design for the queen,

3207
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,760
he would do a great job.

3208
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,760
The same with packaging.

3209
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,760
It's a pity that the queen

3210
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,760
didn't marry us.

3211
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,760
I think it would be good for her too.

3212
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,760
It's probably easier to eat

3213
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,760
English than you do.

3214
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,760
It was.

3215
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,760
Or let's say, designer packaging.

3216
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,760
Designer packaging.

3217
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,760
I will add that.

3218
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,760
Printed packaging.

3219
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,760
Freaking art.

3220
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,320
I also found him

3221
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,320
on Instagram.

3222
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,320
Of all the places.

3223
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,320
I knew he was working

3224
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,320
for ASML.

3225
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,320
He was developing

3226
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,320
processors for ASML.

3227
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,320
For AMD, for Intel.

3228
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,320
No, not processors, I mean machines

3229
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,320
that make those processors.

3230
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,320
They make them in Taiwan.

3231
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,320
Machines are made in the Netherlands.

3232
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,320
But I haven't worked there yet.

3233
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,320
You can be a high-skilled man

3234
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,880
if you have a machine

3235
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,880
that makes ASML.

3236
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,880
A 7-year-old machine

3237
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,880
can make it in one go.

3238
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,880
They have such requirements.

3239
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,880
I mean,

3240
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,880
partly it's luck, partly

3241
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
it's an intention.

3242
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,880
I mean, by force.

3243
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,880
I'm a bit embarrassed

3244
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,880
that I did something

3245
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,880
but I have long-term

3246
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,880
relations with such people.

3247
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,880
Look,

3248
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,440
my skill set is just that.

3249
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,440
Bring the idea together

3250
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,440
and pack it

3251
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,440
into a whole car.

3252
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,440
Marketing.

3253
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,440
What you do here is excellent marketing.

3254
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,440
What you do on YouTube

3255
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,440
is excellent marketing.

3256
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,440
Will that be enough

3257
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,440
for you to reach people who need this type of content?

3258
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,440
That's the million dollar question.

3259
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,440
I don't know.

3260
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,440
I mean, that's the biggest...

3261
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,440
That's why I can't sleep at the moment.

3262
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
If that happens...

3263
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
How will you reach

3264
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
those people who sold you

3265
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
12 sets of what you have at home?

3266
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I'm going to attack those forums

3267
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
in the same way.

3268
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
For example,

3269
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
this Mechanical Keyboards

3270
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
will be the first big launch

3271
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
when I'm ready.

3272
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Now I have a bit of time

3273
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
before the holidays,

3274
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
but I'm already late.

3275
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I'm already thinking about

3276
01:54:48,559 --> 01:54:50,559
mid-holidays or January.

3277
01:54:50,559 --> 01:54:52,559
I'm going to start.

3278
01:54:52,559 --> 01:54:54,559
It's a bit easier now.

3279
01:54:54,559 --> 01:54:56,559
I'll see.

3280
01:54:56,559 --> 01:54:58,559
I haven't decided yet.

3281
01:54:58,559 --> 01:55:00,559
You have a subreddit,

3282
01:55:00,559 --> 01:55:02,559
a forum,

3283
01:55:02,559 --> 01:55:04,559
and a whole Discord server

3284
01:55:04,559 --> 01:55:06,559
for different brands of mechanical keyboards,

3285
01:55:06,559 --> 01:55:08,559
keyset makers, designers.

3286
01:55:08,559 --> 01:55:10,559
It's full.

3287
01:55:10,559 --> 01:55:12,559
I mean, look...

3288
01:55:12,559 --> 01:55:14,559
You have to find the tribe.

3289
01:55:14,559 --> 01:55:16,559
You don't have to find it.

3290
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,119
You have to show that you know what you're doing.

3291
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:21,119
On a professional level,

3292
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:23,119
you can introduce yourself.

3293
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,119
And introduce myself

3294
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:27,119
so that they buy

3295
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:29,119
my story.

3296
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:31,119
Because stories are what they sell.

3297
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:35,119
Why...

3298
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:37,119
You probably have an answer.

3299
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:39,119
Why didn't you do that

3300
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,119
through crowdfunding?

3301
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:43,119
Because...

3302
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:45,119
That's a very

3303
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:47,679
simple answer.

3304
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,679
I believe you.

3305
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:55,679
Because of global logistical

3306
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,679
difficulties at the moment,

3307
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:59,679
it's simply

3308
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:01,679
too hard

3309
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:03,679
to keep a promise.

3310
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:05,679
That is,

3311
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,679
when you go to crowdfunding,

3312
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:09,679
you promise something.

3313
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:11,679
You promise a product,

3314
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,679
some qualities to some people.

3315
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:16,239
And if you're not

3316
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:18,239
able to keep that promise,

3317
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:20,239
your credibility drops.

3318
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:22,239
The longer it lasts,

3319
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:24,239
the less credibility you have.

3320
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:26,239
And today, I simply wouldn't

3321
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,239
trust to say that...

3322
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,239
Look, a printer could be

3323
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,239
30% more expensive

3324
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:34,239
if I sourced it all in Chinese.

3325
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:36,239
30% would be low, for example.

3326
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,239
Then I don't have any

3327
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,239
supervision over the quality,

3328
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,239
if I wasn't there.

3329
01:56:42,799 --> 01:56:44,799
If a printer is low,

3330
01:56:44,799 --> 01:56:46,799
it's going to break,

3331
01:56:46,799 --> 01:56:48,799
and I have to send it back

3332
01:56:48,799 --> 01:56:50,799
a month later,

3333
01:56:50,799 --> 01:56:52,799
so they can dispute

3334
01:56:52,799 --> 01:56:54,799
and say, no, it's not appropriate

3335
01:56:54,799 --> 01:56:56,799
for shipping.

3336
01:56:56,799 --> 01:56:58,799
I don't have supervision.

3337
01:56:58,799 --> 01:57:00,799
If I were to give my name

3338
01:57:00,799 --> 01:57:02,799
for a loan,

3339
01:57:02,799 --> 01:57:04,800
and then not fulfill it,

3340
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,800
it would just tear me apart.

3341
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,800
Quality reason.

3342
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,800
If I want to sell

3343
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:13,359
something, I need to see

3344
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:15,359
that it's really the best,

3345
01:57:15,359 --> 01:57:17,359
so we can solve

3346
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:19,359
every problem.

3347
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:21,359
And also not to exploit

3348
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:23,359
a system with which...

3349
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:25,359
Maybe that's for another podcast,

3350
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:27,359
if I'm not mistaken,

3351
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:29,359
that we're sourcing everything

3352
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:31,359
so we can survive.

3353
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:33,359
Because now,

3354
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:35,359
it's really affecting us.

3355
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:37,359
That means that now,

3356
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:39,359
in the first phase,

3357
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,920
the first phase is not touched

3358
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,920
by anyone.

3359
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,920
The first phase,

3360
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,920
yes, it's true,

3361
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:49,920
but it's not

3362
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,920
going to the printer

3363
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:53,920
to print something.

3364
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,920
No, I will be happy,

3365
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,920
but the first phase

3366
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,920
is really...

3367
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:01,920
I need to find a rhythm.

3368
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,920
I don't have to,

3369
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,920
when I don't have experience,

3370
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,920
give someone a guide,

3371
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:10,479
but this series is really good

3372
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:12,479
for learning,

3373
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:14,479
and I will have that

3374
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:16,479
in my hands.

3375
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:20,479
I will now try

3376
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:22,479
to translate

3377
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:24,479
our part

3378
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:26,479
in the end.

3379
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:28,479
What would

3380
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:30,479
maybe

3381
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:32,479
1000 euros for a printer

3382
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:34,479
be for people

3383
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:36,479
who are not

3384
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:39,040
interested in printing,

3385
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,040
but maybe they are interested

3386
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,040
in how printers work,

3387
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,040
and maybe they want

3388
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,040
to get in touch with it.

3389
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,040
I don't know, I had a man

3390
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,040
in a job interview

3391
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,040
who made two of his printers

3392
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,040
ultra-proud.

3393
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,040
We have people in Slovenia

3394
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,040
who are very passionate about printers.

3395
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,040
The closest contact

3396
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,040
with you,

3397
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:05,040
or not.

3398
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:07,599
How do they come to you?

3399
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:09,599
Thank you for the interview.

3400
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,599
What would you say?

3401
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:13,599
Do you want help?

3402
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:15,599
Do you want to talk to people

3403
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:17,599
around you?

3404
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:19,599
Or will you do it alone?

3405
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:21,599
First,

3406
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,599
I am very excited

3407
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:25,599
if I can talk to people

3408
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:27,599
about it.

3409
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:29,599
On Twitter, I seem to be the most

3410
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:31,599
publicly posted

3411
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,599
under the tag TomasZaman.

3412
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,160
First, they ping me

3413
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:38,160
for coffee.

3414
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:40,160
I am very happy about these contacts.

3415
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:42,160
You never know how you can

3416
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,160
help each other.

3417
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:46,160
Unfortunately,

3418
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:48,160
I also don't have time.

3419
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,160
I can't always

3420
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:52,160
post things

3421
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,160
that are on the agenda,

3422
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,160
but in the beginning I am always ready

3423
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,160
to connect with the world.

3424
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:00,160
I am also always happy

3425
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:02,160
if they are positive.

3426
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:04,719
I don't know

3427
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:06,719
how to say it,

3428
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:08,719
but I also don't know

3429
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:10,719
how to say it.

3430
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:12,719
I don't need such stories.

3431
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:14,719
I wrote

3432
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:16,719
a comment

3433
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:18,719
on your post.

3434
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:20,719
I wanted to type

3435
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:22,719
the end of the post.

3436
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:24,719
Some comments

3437
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:26,719
are great,

3438
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:28,719
but I wrote

3439
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:30,719
...

3440
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,280
The comment

3441
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,280
on the video

3442
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,280
was

3443
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,280
with the word

3444
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,280
clickbait

3445
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,280
fake

3446
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,280
gay shit.

3447
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,280
I thought

3448
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,280
what the hell is going on with you?

3449
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:53,280
You can have thick skin

3450
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,280
for naysayers,

3451
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,280
no goers,

3452
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,280
and people

3453
02:00:59,839 --> 02:01:01,839
get negative

3454
02:01:01,839 --> 02:01:03,839
feedback

3455
02:01:03,839 --> 02:01:05,839
from you.

3456
02:01:05,839 --> 02:01:07,839
People get

3457
02:01:07,839 --> 02:01:09,839
negative feedback

3458
02:01:09,839 --> 02:01:11,839
for projects

3459
02:01:11,839 --> 02:01:13,839
that are ambitious,

3460
02:01:13,839 --> 02:01:15,839
that maybe

3461
02:01:15,839 --> 02:01:17,839
cross the line.

3462
02:01:19,839 --> 02:01:21,839
Where is the flow?

3463
02:01:21,839 --> 02:01:23,839
This comment

3464
02:01:23,839 --> 02:01:25,839
is not cool,

3465
02:01:25,839 --> 02:01:27,839
but people get it.

3466
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,400
What would you advise

3467
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,400
gay people to do?

3468
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,400
Don't be afraid on Twitter.

3469
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:36,400
You get white skin.

3470
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,400
Really!

3471
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,400
This shit can't come under your skin.

3472
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,400
Yes, yes, yes.

3473
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,400
Twitter is like that.

3474
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,400
A wonderful net.

3475
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,400
To see that you are serious

3476
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,400
and I don't give a fuck.

3477
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,400
Because it's really public.

3478
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,400
I adore Twitter.

3479
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,400
I met a lot of people on Twitter.

3480
02:01:56,959 --> 02:01:58,959
I was on a date

3481
02:01:58,959 --> 02:02:00,959
with someone I've never seen before.

3482
02:02:00,959 --> 02:02:02,959
But on Twitter you share

3483
02:02:02,959 --> 02:02:04,959
a smile and a lot of the same looks.

3484
02:02:04,959 --> 02:02:06,959
I would say it's a sub-ethnic soul.

3485
02:02:06,959 --> 02:02:08,959
We were chatting for two hours.

3486
02:02:08,959 --> 02:02:10,959
What was the best friend?

3487
02:02:10,959 --> 02:02:12,959
A vest.

3488
02:02:12,959 --> 02:02:14,959
Twitter is a law.

3489
02:02:14,959 --> 02:02:16,959
But because it's public,

3490
02:02:16,959 --> 02:02:18,959
you get a moustache

3491
02:02:18,959 --> 02:02:20,959
and sometimes it bends

3492
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:22,959
like an elephant.

3493
02:02:22,959 --> 02:02:24,959
But you get thick skin.

3494
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,520
But people,

3495
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,520
I want to add

3496
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,520
don't let those comments

3497
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:33,520
people

3498
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,520
hide behind the name

3499
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,520
come from the living.

3500
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,520
These are not your pages.

3501
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,520
They are not important for the success of the product.

3502
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,520
And don't let it come from the living.

3503
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,520
Yes, yes.

3504
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,520
Maybe that's how it is.

3505
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,520
Comments were great.

3506
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,520
But some were toxic.

3507
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,520
It's probably the same

3508
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:56,079
I don't know.

3509
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:58,079
YouTube can comment

3510
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:00,079
but it's the same thing.

3511
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:02,079
You probably shouldn't have that.

3512
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:04,079
You'll have some trolls there.

3513
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:06,079
These comments

3514
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:08,079
are so off-topic.

3515
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:10,079
When you say

3516
02:03:10,079 --> 02:03:12,079
I won't post a comment anywhere

3517
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:14,079
and I haven't even seen the video.

3518
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:16,079
No, I agree.

3519
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:18,079
I've been in the world for a long time

3520
02:03:18,079 --> 02:03:20,079
and I've seen

3521
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:22,079
such and different public

3522
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:24,640
and I don't like such things.

3523
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:26,640
Sometimes something drives me

3524
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:28,640
in a positive way.

3525
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,640
One person wrote

3526
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:32,640
under a YouTube video

3527
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:34,640
How do you speak like an egg?

3528
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:36,640
Like an egg? Robot?

3529
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,640
I don't want to argue with that.

3530
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:42,640
I saw that

3531
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:44,640
I didn't know how to form a sentence.

3532
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,640
But I want to speak like a robot.

3533
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:48,640
Which is true.

3534
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,640
Starting a YouTube channel

3535
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:53,199
is not easy.

3536
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:55,199
I see a video in 15 minutes

3537
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:57,199
and I shoot it for an hour and a half

3538
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:59,199
because I'm nervous.

3539
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:01,199
Then I go to the bathroom

3540
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:03,199
and shoot another take.

3541
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:05,199
I make 20 takes for the same intro.

3542
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:07,199
It takes 20 minutes

3543
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:09,199
because I see in 5 seconds

3544
02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:11,199
that it's a hook.

3545
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:13,199
I know you're trying

3546
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,199
but I don't know

3547
02:04:15,199 --> 02:04:17,199
Lithuanian,

3548
02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:19,199
Ljubljana,

3549
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,760
Slovakia,

3550
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,760
a hundred thousand things

3551
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,760
and I'm not sure

3552
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,760
if I'm thinking right.

3553
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,760
I'm not immune

3554
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:31,760
to judgment.

3555
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,760
But look,

3556
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,760
I think that

3557
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:37,760
I'll finish

3558
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,760
with one question.

3559
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:43,760
When you were

3560
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:45,760
the technical director

3561
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,760
you were also a guest

3562
02:04:48,319 --> 02:04:50,319
at a WordPress conference

3563
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:52,319
in the Danube region

3564
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:54,319
where you were dressed

3565
02:04:54,319 --> 02:04:56,319
as Superman.

3566
02:04:56,319 --> 02:04:58,319
I think it was

3567
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:00,319
one of the biggest conferences

3568
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:02,319
in the Danube region.

3569
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
this technology in Europe

3570
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
and you came to Oder and you talked

3571
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
you basically said it yourself

3572
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
but there were

3573
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
1300 people and this video

3574
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
is now on volume and I think

3575
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
around 2000-3000 people watched it

3576
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
so around 3000-4000

3577
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
people have seen this content

3578
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
so I would ask you

3579
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
if you could tell

3580
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
how did

3581
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
this project go

3582
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
because I think

3583
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Slovenians couldn't hear

3584
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
what you were saying

3585
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
you were talking about

3586
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
that we are underestimating ourselves

3587
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
you were talking about

3588
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
why we are underestimating ourselves

3589
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
and I know it's not fair

3590
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
to ask you this question

3591
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
but I think it's a powerful lesson

3592
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
and I would like you to repeat it

3593
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
and put it in the heart

3594
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
of our listeners

3595
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I think that

3596
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Slovenians have a big problem

3597
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
with the head

3598
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I have it myself

3599
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
or I had it

3600
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
and I think it's the growth

3601
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
of our elders

3602
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
because they are

3603
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
always so much

3604
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
in the head

3605
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
like God gave you

3606
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
a job

3607
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
or he gives you

3608
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
an overlord

3609
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
and that's what our elders are

3610
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
we were always

3611
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Slovenian boys

3612
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
and I think that

3613
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Slovenians still have it in their blood

3614
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
and I think

3615
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
you can't get rid of it

3616
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I admit that

3617
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
sometimes you think

3618
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
you need an external leader

3619
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
but

3620
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I think

3621
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
that with time

3622
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
you learn

3623
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
if you want to live

3624
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
your time, your knowledge

3625
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
and in Slovenia

3626
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
we have so many

3627
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
quality people

3628
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
quality people, knowledge

3629
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
because I think

3630
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
your podcast is still

3631
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
and I'm not talking for everyone

3632
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
for other guests

3633
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
that we have

3634
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
something to offer the world

3635
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
but the attitude is

3636
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
that it doesn't come in time

3637
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
and I want it

3638
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
globally, when I gave it

3639
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
to a lot of people

3640
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I'm talking from my own experience

3641
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I sold myself for knowledge

3642
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
that I had overpriced

3643
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
then I doubled my price

3644
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
even though it was expensive

3645
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
and I had more time

3646
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
for quality people

3647
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
more time for learning

3648
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
for family, hobbies

3649
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
and more money

3650
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
so this disconnect

3651
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
in Slovenia

3652
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
even more

3653
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I think

3654
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
maybe the western world

3655
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
for example America

3656
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
you can be anything

3657
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
and they sell the American dream

3658
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
and it's the opposite for them

3659
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I think they buy it too much

3660
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
it's like a mix

3661
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
of European modesty

3662
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
and their American

3663
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
overabundance

3664
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
of everything

3665
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
they meet halfway

3666
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
and they're both at their best

3667
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
if I choose

3668
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
someone from the press

3669
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I didn't do it myself

3670
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I don't have a machine

3671
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I only have my hands and my head

3672
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
if it's like it is

3673
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
for my taste

3674
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
you need a lot of people

3675
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
and you find them in Slovenia

3676
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
and we have them

3677
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
the problem with marketing

3678
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
everyone does it

3679
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
and I also found out

3680
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
that we have a lot of R&D

3681
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
developers

3682
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
everyone has their secret

3683
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
laboratory inside

3684
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
and they're working on something

3685
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
and screwing it

3686
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
God knows what the neighbor will say

3687
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I would like to add

3688
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
to say more

3689
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
what you did successfully

3690
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
make that synergy

3691
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
because we're not all good

3692
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
we have someone

3693
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
who is

3694
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
so this synergy

3695
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
it's a common goal

3696
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
we also saw

3697
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
in previous episodes

3698
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
that we, Slovenians, lack

3699
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
to have those circles

3700
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
everyone on their own circle

3701
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
and we try to fit in

3702
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
and that's it

3703
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
and Danes don't understand that

3704
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I had a company in Denmark

3705
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I got to know the culture

3706
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
even my partner

3707
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
was in Slovenia

3708
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
and they can't understand that

3709
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
the neighbor is working hard

3710
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I'll go to him three times a day

3711
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
if I need to

3712
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
how can I help you

3713
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
that's in their DNA

3714
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
or paying taxes

3715
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
for example

3716
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
when he was told that we're

3717
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
a Balkan country and taxes are being optimized

3718
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
and I don't know what

3719
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
he didn't understand

3720
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
it didn't go through his calculator

3721
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
how can you be like that

3722
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
you can't pay taxes

3723
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
say a Dane

3724
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
who has taxes higher than Slovenians

3725
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
and that's much higher

3726
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
say taxes

3727
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
but he didn't know the whole picture

3728
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
and I'm here

3729
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I feel sorry for him in a way

3730
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
I have difficulties

3731
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
sometimes

3732
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
with the environment

3733
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
you have to crawl under your feet

3734
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
yes, yes

3735
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
or vomit

3736
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
now it's even worse for you

3737
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
everyone thinks they know everything

3738
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
but I think that in Slovenia

3739
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
there is a lot of potential for

3740
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
the world to change

3741
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
and even him

3742
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
but no one knows

3743
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
that he will say something to us

3744
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
and no one knows

3745
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
and here you have to deal with time

3746
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I hope

3747
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I hope that someone will hear

3748
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
that we will cooperate

3749
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
you said it with such a monotone voice

3750
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
no

3751
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I hope that we will cooperate

3752
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I can conclude like this

3753
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
if

3754
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
when we got

3755
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
that expensive shit

3756
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
to record sound

3757
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
these microphones

3758
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
and when we talked about what would be the next level

3759
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
for our production

3760
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
for our podcast

3761
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
it was a great video

3762
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
and we started talking

3763
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
we have this video today because of you

3764
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
because you gave us this lesson

3765
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
because you are interested

3766
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
in this kind of production

3767
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
because you see some value

3768
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
in what we start

3769
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
and I wouldn't dare

3770
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
such a production as we have

3771
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
it wouldn't be in such a spotlight

3772
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
it wouldn't be in such a great spotlight

3773
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
there wouldn't be probably Jan and Brodola

3774
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
who have to help each other

3775
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
so we are very grateful to you

3776
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
for everything

3777
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
now this shit is not under the table

3778
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
so people

3779
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
we have to warn that today

3780
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
we tried to raise the level

3781
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
a bit higher

3782
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
we tried to experiment

3783
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
and we tried to show

3784
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
that you can do something

3785
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
I would like to thank you

3786
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
both on this point

3787
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
for your time

3788
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I would like to thank you for post-production

3789
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
see you later

3790
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
see you later

3791
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
people would like

3792
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Odins would like

3793
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
to give feedback

3794
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
on everything we started today

3795
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
so we can see what we start well

3796
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
what we start poorly

3797
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
tell us if you want more of these formats

3798
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
if you want more of Sebin

3799
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
thank you

3800
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Tomas, thank you

3801
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
50 seconds of silence
