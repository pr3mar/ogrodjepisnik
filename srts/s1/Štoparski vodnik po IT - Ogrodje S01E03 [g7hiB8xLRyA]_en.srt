1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here we go, we're recording, we're recording.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, today we have Christopher Černivac as a guest,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Andraž Sraka is with me as well, and I'm Motu Vrgles.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the third episode of the podcast in Grodje,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and I'm going to apologize for the previous episodes.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Before we start, I want to thank everyone who listened to the previous episodes,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
everyone who gave feedback on the previous episodes,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and everyone who will give feedback on this episode as well.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I still did a bit of that official part.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, the topic for today, I won't apologize,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but I'm apologizing to Christopher because I wanted to say

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
how he sees the development of a young engineer,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and how he sees the development of people coming into the industry.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm also interested in his path through the beginnings,

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
maybe how good he is in the world in that direction.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, that would be a topic for today.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's start, I'll give you the opportunity to introduce yourself.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hello, I'm Christophe Zototo.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've been working on various projects for a few years now.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mainly work on back-end, Ruby, Postgres, Classic Stack, Rails, TSDW.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Today's topic is close to me, it's interesting, it's relevant.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I keep asking myself what would help me,

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
when I started programming, what would be the bottom line,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
when I didn't, what would help me make that leap,

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
or that chaos at the beginning, when you have a lot of new things,

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but you don't know what's important, what's not,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and how to segment them.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's it.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Unintentional.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Unintentional? No, when you started,

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
if you look back, what would have been different,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
what lessons learned,

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think that each of us would go back with that mindset,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
with that knowledge we have now.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think that we all, when we went through that learning experience,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
were probably the most motivated in that moment.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's hard to say now, that it would change everything.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think that I spent most of my time,

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
when I was learning how to program, how the system works,

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I needed to fully identify what I need to learn,

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and what is relevant to me.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think that was the hardest, because you have that catch-22,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you have a lot of knowledge you need to acquire,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but you don't have the knowledge to assess what's needed,

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and what's not.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's a classic example.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You need to have the necessary knowledge,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that gives you insight, so you can see,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
if you still don't know everything,

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
why you're not pushing in the situation.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You have to go through a lot of things to get to that level.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
At that point, I think that the curriculum is well-organized,

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
it's not market-oriented, because there's a conflict of interest,

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
or maybe some friends who are already in the industry,

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and they know a little bit more.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think that in that initial phase,

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
it was really important for me,

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to somehow cover the whole area.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
To say, I'm going to learn this one thing,

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and I'm going to learn it well,

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and I'm not going to learn anything else,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
like AngularJS, or...

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But can you quickly assess what that one thing is?

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
As a young engineer,

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
if someone on that path said,

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
this is a task I have to learn,

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that would open up a level for me,

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
to become a better engineer for the moment.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're asking me that,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
when you say, I don't know,

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't know anything, I'm interested,

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and I'm going to give you an example,

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
when I started my career,

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and I wasn't a developer,

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was the most popular PHP.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Can you maybe distinguish,

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
or at the beginning,

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you went through

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
formal programming education,

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
you have a different background,

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Krištof didn't go through

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
formal programming education.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I went post-fest.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You went post-fest in the industry,

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you did something completely different,

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and you come to the industry as someone

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
who doesn't know anything,

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and you do a program for computer engineering,

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and you follow that,

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
but you come in as a total noob.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, you learn some knowledge,

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
like this is a bible,

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you learn all that,

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and you know everything,

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but being an expert in some knowledge,

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
when you print the book,

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and you know what you want to say with it.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How did you establish what you don't know,

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
at the beginning?

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was clear to me that I don't know anything,

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
because if I didn't know,

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
a year ago,

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you open some simple tutorials,

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
on the internet,

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you have as many as you want,

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and then you learn Python,

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in three hours,

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but you don't have a clue,

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you don't know where Python is executed,

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you don't have a context,

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and then there are things like that,

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that you don't understand.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's one of those tricky things,

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
that not only what you learn,

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
but also how to use the system functionally,

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
so that you can progress along the way.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That was the hardest part,

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to see what is relevant.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's like a minefield,

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
if you type on Google,

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
how to get better at programming,

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
or whatever,

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
hyper-industrialized niches,

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
people try to serve you,

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and it's not the best environment,

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to learn something.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Here I'm doing something,

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but here I'm doing something else,

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and I don't even know,

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
how was it,

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
if you remember,

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
was it a part of a community,

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
or a friend,

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
or how was that transition,

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
if you come from an environment,

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
where it wasn't close to you,

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
was it that transition,

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that someone who had a computer,

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
started reading games,

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and how did it come about,

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that this job interests you so much,

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that it's a potential career for you?

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
To start doing that,

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I would say,

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
let's say,

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that I identified three things,

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
first, that you don't have a computer,

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
as a role model,

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and second, that you can have a job,

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and serve with it.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The concept of programming is interesting,

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
there are some services,

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
let's take a look,

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and then I spent a lot of time,

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
trying to figure out,

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
what is the programming language,

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
there are some recurring concepts,

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
you have other paradigms,

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but it's not completely different,

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
it's not like if you learn Python,

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
you don't have to translate anything into Javascript,

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
or something like that.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
After I entered the rabbit hole,

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I identified C,

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
as the language I had to learn.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Those were some of the arguments,

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that convinced me,

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know if I still have them today.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Low-level language,

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
most of the software is written in C,

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
on all machines,

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
by default, if you have Linux,

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and so on.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Plus, various YouTube tutorials,

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that are also written in C.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So I decided to learn C,

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you have online courses,

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
like Harvard,

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and then I found a cool book,

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
in English,

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I could improve my pronunciation,

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but it's 300-400 pages of C,

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
a book to learn C,

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and I decided,

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
this is what I want to do.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No other tutorials,

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
just to focus on one thing.

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What was great about the book,

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
is that it had a lot of ideas,

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
so whenever you adopted a concept,

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you had a lot of ideas,

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and you implemented them.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So this was a task,

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
that you could check,

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
or was it an example,

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
that you looked at,

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and based on that,

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
it was clear to you?

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You had a dream,

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
then you had examples,

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
then you had 5-6 tasks,

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and then you wrote them down,

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
to make them more complex,

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to make a matrix,

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and so on.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So I learned a lot,

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and I wrote the first non-trivial program,

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
which is more than 10 lines,

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and it lasted for hours,

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
10 hours,

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and it was a complete mess.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You know you forgot semicolons,

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
because you have signatures,

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
because you have beginner,

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
unfriendly error messages,

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and you don't know error messages,

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and it takes a lot of time,

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
but you learn a few more things,

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and you move forward.

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When did you realize,

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that you failed?

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Did you think,

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to try again,

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and now I'm going to fail,

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and maybe it's not for me?

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You have to have some inner motivation,

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
if you don't have it,

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you can get into a situation,

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
where you are more motivated,

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
like I said,

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the sun is the battle,

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
or the army,

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
when you fight for something,

236
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you fight for it.

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Maybe you have to find the reason,

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and stand by it,

239
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and the army in front of you,

240
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and you fail in the process.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It can't be an option,

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
it has to be a wall,

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that's why it's not acceptable.

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The other part is negative motivation.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Positive motivation was,

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
that I was surprised,

247
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
how much pleasure you get,

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
when you solve a problem.

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You get a feedback loop,

250
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
like a medicine,

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you get pleasure,

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and you feel like,

253
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
let's solve the problem,

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and when you do that,

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
it's clear to you,

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that even if you are in the problem for 6 hours,

257
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you are going to solve it,

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and you have to be confident,

259
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that you can do it.

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not only for nerds,

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
that have been doing it for 5 years,

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
on some obscure machines,

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
but you can learn it in 20 years.

264
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That was the first step,

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that I know something in a language,

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
but what was the question,

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
if you want to have a job,

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I know C, but what?

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That was my next question,

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
how do you know,

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that C is not something,

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that you can live from now on,

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and how do you get from C to Ruby,

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and maybe another question,

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
if you know C, what are the algorithms,

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
quick sort, bubble sort,

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
something that middle school students,

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
train on.

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
A really cool thing about the book,

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and the CS50 Harvard program,

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
is that you get to know the concepts,

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
maybe not in detail,

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but the concept of sorting,

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and how it's done,

285
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and the concept of memory management,

286
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
that you go from nothing to one,

287
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to a computer that works,

288
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
so you can imagine,

289
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
how it works.

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But how do you do the transition,

291
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I know something, I'd have a job,

292
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
that was another thing,

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
you get to know the industry,

294
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I didn't know how many programmers,

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
there were 5 or 10,

296
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
you don't know,

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
or maybe 50,

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
you don't have a feeling.

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And then I started to search,

300
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
how to get a job,

301
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and then you have stacks,

302
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
one of them stays in the middle,

303
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and then you fall into that part,

304
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and then you find...

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So you identified,

306
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
that it's good to get into some structure.

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes, exactly.

308
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There's an ecosystem of things,

309
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you don't have to say,

310
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I know C, but nothing else.

311
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's a curriculum,

312
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
it's called Lawn School,

313
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I liked it,

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
in the sense of the slow path,

315
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
take your time, master your shit,

316
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
that's it.

317
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What was cool to me,

318
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
was that you had a very focused way of learning,

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
you learn how a method works,

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
that's what you learn,

321
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
nothing else.

322
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And that helps you understand things,

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
that you don't have a lot of knowledge.

324
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Another important thing,

325
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is that they tell you,

326
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
if you want to work in this industry,

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you know the programming language,

328
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but it's good to know a few things,

329
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
or to know how to use git,

330
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
or how to work with command line utility,

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
or how to work with a storage solution,

332
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
or Postgres, a database,

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
or if you want to work with the web,

334
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you have to know the concept,

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and the protocols,

336
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
which are very simple,

337
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and then you expand that picture,

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
so you can write something in it,

339
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but the code is in some context,

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and then you learn that.

341
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And when you get used to it,

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and you want to write an application,

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and I was at Heroku,

344
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
a simple application,

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and I was like, wow,

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that thing is alive,

347
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and it jumped.

348
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You didn't try it.

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No, no.

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It was great,

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but as you said,

352
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
you had a military-disciplined attitude.

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There is a mission, I'm getting there,

354
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
no matter what.

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And now you created some courses,

356
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
which you had the opportunity to have,

357
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
which are international,

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
for a local community,

359
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
which I think,

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
some local developers,

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
developed something,

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
so that's why my question,

363
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
or the following question,

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
is how do you know that this is a goal,

365
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and that you will achieve it

366
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
with a really good focus.

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And now you described your example,

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you had the opportunity to see

369
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
a book on the Internet.

370
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
When I was learning C,

371
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
there was a book.

372
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The Internet was a dial-up,

373
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and on the page there was Google,

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and a book.

375
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You went to the book,

376
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
copied the examples,

377
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and learned from them.

378
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Now you mentioned a local community.

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I would say that the third leap I made,

380
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
as you said,

381
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
now we have the Internet,

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
it's simple, you get a hit,

383
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and you can do this,

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
get some people,

385
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
social circle,

386
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I didn't know that meetup.com

387
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
had such a thing.

388
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
With time I learned Ruby,

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and I was like,

390
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
can anyone in Slovenia do this?

391
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You are a pre-Ruby on Rails.

392
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Why Ruby?

393
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't have to answer that.

394
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I sold it to me.

395
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
General purpose language,

396
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
widely used, OK paid,

397
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and I was like, OK, cool.

398
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I didn't know anything better.

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What attracted me to them,

400
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
was the approach.

401
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think everyone starts

402
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
by doing a course,

403
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
where they tell you that you know it,

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
but you don't really know it.

405
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You don't know how to write anything,

406
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you don't know how to edit codes,

407
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
you don't know how to commit anything,

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and that's why I liked that approach.

409
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Let's do it the other way around.

410
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's do a little bit,

411
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and learn it well,

412
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and then a little bit more,

413
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and learn it well,

414
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and so on.

415
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Why Ruby?

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They had it in the curriculum,

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but if I go back,

418
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I started looking for people

419
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
who work with Ruby in Slovenia.

420
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I started a Ruby meet-up,

421
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and Otto Brgljeza,

422
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
who organized it,

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
showed up, and it was the best.

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You can ask these people real questions.

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What do you do?

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's important for someone

427
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
who's looking for a job.

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
How long did it take

429
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
to start learning Ruby?

430
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Less than a year.

431
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I started learning Ruby

432
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
in February,

433
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and then I started

434
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
doing other things,

435
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and I started in January.

436
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It took me 11 months.

437
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I prepared a lot of material,

438
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and I realized that

439
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
anything less than 20 hours a week

440
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
is useless.

441
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You need a critical mass of time

442
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
to invest it.

443
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I spent more than 20 hours a week,

444
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
or sometimes more.

445
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I didn't do anything else.

446
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I drew from other things,

447
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and I decided what I would do.

448
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You have a military attitude.

449
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yes, exactly.

450
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Very, very focused.

451
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I would say that for someone

452
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
who graduated from high school,

453
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
or graduated from high school,

454
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
or graduated from FACS,

455
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
it's not at that level.

456
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I know that some people

457
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
are more like that through the game.

458
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You play with it a bit,

459
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
then it accepts you,

460
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and then you let it go.

461
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't have that attitude in life.

462
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's the same concept

463
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
with other skills.

464
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You don't have to study,

465
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
you don't have to do anything.

466
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's not a hobby,

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
but let's admit it.

468
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a proper way, isn't it?

469
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes, yes.

470
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Now, you said that you won't record everything.

471
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm happy that you understood that.

472
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That you understood that.

473
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What surprised me when I first saw Christophe,

474
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
when I first met him,

475
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
was that he came to Ruby Meetup,

476
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I introduced myself,

477
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I asked him how it started,

478
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and he came with very specific,

479
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
unconnected questions about Ruby.

480
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
He was asking about things that,

481
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
with which you are in the picture,

482
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
as an industrial production code,

483
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
you are working on,

484
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
you are learning,

485
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
for example, I don't know,

486
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
how some objects are adopted,

487
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
how they are simplified,

488
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
you know, how the object model works,

489
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and I don't know what else.

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And they were, of course,

491
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
very incoherent, unconnected questions,

492
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
yes, yes, yes,

493
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
but, no.

494
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The main question was,

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
if you got down to some things

496
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
that are too deep,

497
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
too unconnected,

498
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
from some useful values,

499
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
you know,

500
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
my challenge,

501
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
what I saw was,

502
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
what do you need at that time,

503
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
to be complemented with what

504
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
we see in the industry,

505
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
to be complemented with what is useful there,

506
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
to be complemented in the right way,

507
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and to be given an opportunity.

508
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
As a mentor,

509
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
or as someone who builds

510
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
some teams,

511
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
those are the three things

512
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
that I saw.

513
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I saw that you are interested in things,

514
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
that you are very open-minded,

515
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I saw that you are focused on some things,

516
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
are they right or not,

517
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
is it a matter of debate,

518
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
consistency,

519
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
you see in a person,

520
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
community outreach,

521
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and passion.

522
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Before,

523
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
there were a lot of meetups,

524
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
a step forward.

525
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yes, that's it.

526
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I felt like a kid on a candy store,

527
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
you know,

528
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
when people know about those things,

529
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you don't even ask them, you grab them.

530
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Those were some meetups,

531
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
something for a stand.

532
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Beer was needed.

533
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Let me say this,

534
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
for example,

535
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
blockchain, bitcoin,

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
a lot of people are doing it,

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
it's revolutionary,

538
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
blockchain will change finance,

539
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
industry, internet, everything.

540
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's all cool,

541
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
but you worked with Ethereum,

542
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
you worked with Solidity Contract,

543
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and then...

544
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I wrote a whole list.

545
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You wrote a whole list.

546
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Where do you draw the line?

547
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What do you think?

548
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You managed to combine

549
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
some Ruby knowledge,

550
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
C-knowledge,

551
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and then you simply ate

552
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
a lot of it.

553
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes, I think it was interesting.

554
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What's your take on that?

555
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
My take,

556
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
from the perspective of someone

557
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
who would like to learn programming,

558
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
is not to follow the hype.

559
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Well...

560
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
There are a lot of things like that,

561
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and a lot of new things.

562
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
One of the things I noticed

563
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
when I started

564
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
is that it's not used much anymore,

565
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it's a legacy.

566
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I haven't been in the industry for 5 years,

567
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
but on the other hand,

568
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
there are a lot of things

569
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
that don't change,

570
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and from time to time,

571
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
a long time ago,

572
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
we talked about algorithms,

573
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
basic concepts,

574
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
things like that.

575
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
My focus would be

576
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
on things that don't change,

577
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
so that you understand

578
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
those things in depth,

579
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and that you don't fall

580
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
into the hype,

581
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
like, solidity is the next big thing.

582
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You don't know how to program,

583
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and the first thing you jump on

584
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
is solidity.

585
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm not saying...

586
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I wouldn't say that,

587
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
because a lot of specific things

588
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
are done by scientists anyway,

589
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
so it's risky.

590
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So...

591
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I imagined it like a concept.

592
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I imagined it,

593
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and here it is.

594
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's a game.

595
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
There are some tokens,

596
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and other things.

597
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't know,

598
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
my experience with the crypto world

599
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
was in 2018,

600
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
when I was inside.

601
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
ERC-721, or NFT,

602
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
came out of nowhere,

603
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I think.

604
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Now it's bleeding edge,

605
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I don't know how it is now,

606
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
maybe it's better,

607
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
but you find bugs in the compiler,

608
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
things like that.

609
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The ecosystem really exists,

610
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you don't have good ways

611
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
to test things.

612
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
If you want to help

613
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
with material, books, blog posts,

614
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and so on,

615
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
there's so little of it.

616
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Things like that.

617
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You spend a lot of time,

618
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and you have to know

619
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that there are very few people

620
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
who can help you,

621
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
because you're a pioneer

622
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
among those hyper-nerds

623
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
who designed Ethereum, VN, etc.

624
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Where do you become a nerd,

625
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
or a geek?

626
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's the second or third time

627
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I've been asked this question.

628
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Are you a geek?

629
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Am I a nerd?

630
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I think we should first

631
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
tell what it is.

632
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Tell us what it is,

633
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
because you've said it twice.

634
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I think that

635
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
in the general public,

636
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
a nerd is a model

637
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that deals too much

638
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
with specific problems,

639
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and it's hard to tell

640
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
what it's dealing with.

641
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's developing

642
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
kernel modules for something,

643
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and you don't understand

644
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
what it's talking about,

645
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and you start using a word

646
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
that nobody knows about.

647
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I would say that it's a nerd.

648
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
To devote my whole life to it,

649
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I would say that it's a nerd.

650
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I would agree.

651
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
How would you describe a nerd?

652
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm a poor guy.

653
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
A poor guy.

654
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
At least,

655
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
maybe a little bit

656
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
of a Hollywood approach.

657
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
When these things

658
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
become,

659
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I won't say mainstream,

660
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
but they've started

661
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
to be used in mainstream sitcoms

662
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and movies.

663
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I would compare it to a nerd.

664
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Not all people

665
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
who deal with it are nerds.

666
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But there is a certain profile

667
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
of people who deal with this stereotype.

668
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't do it as a crime.

669
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't think so.

670
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Moto, are you a nerd?

671
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Are you a geek?

672
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I actually enjoy

673
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
what I do.

674
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
When people ask me what I do,

675
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I say I'm an artist.

676
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's the same here.

677
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
A nerd doesn't enjoy

678
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
being called a nerd.

679
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Maybe a nerd is more of a state of mind.

680
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
If I'm not mistaken,

681
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
what surprises me

682
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
is that

683
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
a lot of labels

684
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
have prejudices.

685
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
For example,

686
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
if someone

687
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
comes to you

688
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
as a programmer,

689
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
it's great.

690
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
If someone comes to you

691
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
as an engineer,

692
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
it's great too.

693
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I think that

694
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
a label like Junior

695
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
or Junior Developer

696
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
can also

697
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
exaggerate people

698
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
in terms of their opportunities.

699
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Maybe if

700
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Krištof

701
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
was a successful engineer,

702
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
it would be less successful.

703
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But if there was

704
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
a force

705
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
on him

706
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
to have a formal education,

707
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
or if there was a force

708
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
on him to be Junior,

709
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
it would be great.

710
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Do you think that

711
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
formal education

712
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
would be

713
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
too much?

714
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
If I look at myself

715
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
with a formal education,

716
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I don't think

717
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
it would give me

718
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
a skill set.

719
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It would be

720
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
more of a passion

721
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
to deal with technology

722
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and develop it.

723
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I can also comment on that.

724
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
After Fest,

725
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I started

726
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
getting a formal education.

727
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I would say that

728
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
in the final phase,

729
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
you have to learn on your own.

730
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
At the beginning, I said

731
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that the hardest part

732
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
is to prepare myself

733
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
for what I have to learn.

734
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That's what the faculty does.

735
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You come in, they give you books,

736
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
you learn, write and that's it.

737
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But the difference is

738
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that you write it down

739
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and move on,

740
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
so you can understand it.

741
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The faculty can't guarantee that.

742
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's not like

743
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
you can say

744
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
on a high level

745
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
that you heard about Java

746
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and you know how to write it.

747
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But you can't distinguish

748
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
between people

749
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
who spend hours and hours

750
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
digging into the location of the object,

751
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
garbage collection,

752
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
trying to understand it from the inside out,

753
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and someone else

754
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
who has a stack overflow script.

755
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Maybe it's just

756
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the formal education,

757
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
but in a sense,

758
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
what they give you

759
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
are the foundations.

760
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I think that

761
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
you are still a bit

762
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
accustomed to

763
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
computer science,

764
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
or a developer,

765
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
or an engineer.

766
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You don't know how to work

767
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
with computers.

768
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
If you don't buy some components,

769
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you don't know how

770
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
the computer works,

771
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and how the operating system works.

772
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Why do we have an operating system?

773
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
What are some functions?

774
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He builds it on some application

775
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that runs on the operating system.

776
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
He lacks the basics.

777
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So, if I look at it

778
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
from a formal perspective,

779
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
what he gave me

780
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and what he gave me to look at,

781
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
those are the things.

782
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
When I went through this process,

783
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I thought,

784
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
why do we have to deal

785
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
with a task, a book,

786
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
or something bigger.

787
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But those are the foundations

788
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that later make you

789
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
realize, aha, that's why.

790
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I agree.

791
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
For me,

792
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
this was the best fact

793
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
that a student,

794
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
if they don't deal with it,

795
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
their theory,

796
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
the theoretical basis of things,

797
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
is deeper.

798
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
As a self-taught,

799
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
you're more oriented to practical things.

800
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Can I write a program

801
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that does something?

802
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Do I know how to use

803
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Ubuntu Box in this or that way?

804
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Meanwhile,

805
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
here you get

806
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
a more conceptual understanding of things.

807
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You get to know

808
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
mathematics, logic,

809
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and so on.

810
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Even if you want to take a research paper,

811
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
you take it in your hands.

812
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That's something

813
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that the faculty can help you with.

814
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But my opinion is

815
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
that if you want,

816
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
you can learn everything

817
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
straight from the textbook.

818
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You have to know

819
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and rely on yourself

820
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
to know what's relevant.

821
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Do we have time for questions?

822
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I would like to hear

823
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
this comment

824
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
about formal education.

825
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I see,

826
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
as one of the

827
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Slovenian developers,

828
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
from the community,

829
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I see a lot of posts

830
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
where students ask

831
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
if they haven't asked

832
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
if it's worth it

833
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
to finish formal education,

834
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
or if it's worth it,

835
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
because what we all learn

836
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
is based on computer science.

837
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Is it worth it

838
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
to work with

839
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
one student

840
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
in an industry?

841
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That's a question

842
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that hasn't been seen

843
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
that often.

844
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I would suggest

845
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
that those

846
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
who are already

847
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
in the system,

848
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
who have been here

849
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
for several weeks,

850
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
because you get

851
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
a curriculum,

852
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
as you said,

853
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and you see things

854
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that you wouldn't see

855
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and you get things

856
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that you need,

857
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
but you also get

858
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
a certain breadth.

859
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Especially now,

860
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
if you go into

861
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
some scientific fields,

862
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
then you absolutely

863
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
need that,

864
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
but I think

865
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
we both need it.

866
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
In this team,

867
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
we both need it.

868
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
For sure.

869
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Formal education doesn't hurt.

870
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yes, absolutely.

871
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What I see in companies

872
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
is that it becomes

873
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
a problem or a challenge

874
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
when you're

875
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
an engineer for a while,

876
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and then maybe you get

877
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
some inspiration to go

878
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
to a bigger system,

879
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
where a formal education

880
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
is more convenient.

881
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Or, for example,

882
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
if you have a formal education

883
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in computer science,

884
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
then you go to a company

885
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
to study or something else.

886
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I wanted to say that.

887
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
A good insurance policy

888
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
is that if you get

889
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
IT full time,

890
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and you want to work

891
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
in the public sector,

892
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
then you're like,

893
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm done.

894
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Half of our employees

895
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
work in the public sector.

896
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I wrote down

897
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
three things for you,

898
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
so you can choose one.

899
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Are you ready?

900
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Go ahead.

901
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You're going to choose.

902
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
First, let's talk

903
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
about side projects.

904
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
How do you choose them,

905
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and what do you do?

906
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's a bit boring,

907
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
but it's a safe route.

908
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The second thing is

909
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
what do you eat

910
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
in a company,

911
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
so you can eat

912
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Venezuelan spammers.

913
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Then I have cockfighting.

914
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That's an interesting topic.

915
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's very popular

916
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
in East Asia.

917
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
In East Asia.

918
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And then I have

919
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
philosophy,

920
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and we had a debate

921
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
about known unknowns,

922
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and unknown unknowns.

923
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It was Rumsfeld who developed it.

924
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Those are four topics

925
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
that you can choose.

926
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You said three,

927
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
but you said four in East Asia.

928
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yes, yes.

929
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Those are just some options.

930
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I can only choose one.

931
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yes, I can choose cockfighting.

932
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Cockfighting is interesting,

933
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
but let's talk about

934
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Venezuelan spammers.

935
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's not because they're from Venezuela,

936
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
but because they're spammers.

937
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It was an interesting area

938
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
where we worked.

939
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's called fraud prevention.

940
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It turns out

941
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
that if you pay money

942
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
on the Internet,

943
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
it attracts different people,

944
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and they try to hack the system.

945
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Then you have different ways

946
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
to prevent it.

947
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
If you want to

948
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
prevent specific people,

949
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
you have to track them.

950
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Then you have an interesting

951
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
dynamic where

952
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
these people develop a software

953
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
or do various things on the go.

954
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Then you detect it

955
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and prevent it.

956
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Then they adapt

957
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and start using

958
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
the new system.

959
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Then you detect it again and prevent it again.

960
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So you have a nice arms race

961
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
for the people on the Internet.

962
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Here we had

963
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
various things,

964
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
from the simplest to the most sophisticated.

965
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You can see

966
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
that people are immune

967
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
to your system

968
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and then you try

969
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
to clear the database.

970
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
These were very good challenges.

971
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Andras is very big

972
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
in this area.

973
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I think

974
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
that this is

975
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
constantly

976
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
evolving.

977
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You will see

978
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
what will happen

979
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
in the future.

980
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Even if they

981
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
automate on the other side,

982
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
what is it

983
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
for Mechanical Turk

984
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
and all those indices

985
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that can click it manually?

986
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And

987
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
on the other hand,

988
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
there is a lot more.

989
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
There is a labor force that is really undervalued.

990
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This labor force is so big

991
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
that there are

992
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
whole farms.

993
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
On the one hand,

994
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you are fighting against this fraud

995
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and you are looking for

996
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
human behavior or anomalies.

997
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And in the end,

998
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
you see that it is very difficult.

999
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You can have a human

1000
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that just clicks

1001
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
a lot of times.

1002
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
One of the approaches

1003
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
that we had was very economical.

1004
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We were aware of

1005
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
this.

1006
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It is very interesting

1007
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
that some groups are falling apart.

1008
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Scammers or whatever.

1009
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And then you contact the support.

1010
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Those other scammers

1011
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
are also anonymous.

1012
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And if you look at them,

1013
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
it is interesting.

1014
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The whole economic approach is like

1015
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
let's make sure that people

1016
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
don't pay or that they have to pay

1017
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
all the time if they want to go up.

1018
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And in this way,

1019
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
you can convince

1020
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
some people.

1021
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Or maybe

1022
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
their account is not that good

1023
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and they will go somewhere

1024
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
where the account is better.

1025
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Does reCAPTCHA work?

1026
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
No.

1027
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Telephone verification works?

1028
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Email verification works?

1029
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
No.

1030
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I haven't found anything that is not silver bullet.

1031
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You can use all of it

1032
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and someone will know

1033
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
about it.

1034
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And verification through Facebook,

1035
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Google?

1036
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It is a little bit better,

1037
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
but not enough.

1038
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Only because you outsource

1039
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
New York customer, Google and Facebook.

1040
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Let's ask differently.

1041
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
We assume

1042
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
that you will always have

1043
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
a percentage of fraud.

1044
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And how to reduce

1045
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
this percentage as much as possible.

1046
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We know that there can't be zero.

1047
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Which mechanisms

1048
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
could be in place

1049
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
when they reduce it

1050
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
to 10%?

1051
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And that you prepare

1052
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
those 10%?

1053
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We had much more sophisticated systems.

1054
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
We had machine learning algorithms

1055
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and detection of different patterns.

1056
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
In my experience,

1057
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
with every additional thing

1058
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
you want to do,

1059
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
with every additional thing,

1060
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
you reduce the percentage of fraud.

1061
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And maybe you set

1062
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
different incentives

1063
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
so that people pay less.

1064
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And so on.

1065
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
When you have

1066
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
more fraud,

1067
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
you have to be careful.

1068
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Because you don't want

1069
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
to make the user experience worse.

1070
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Or make it harder

1071
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
to onboard legitimate users.

1072
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So you have to be careful

1073
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
between yourself and others.

1074
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You don't want to be...

1075
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I think the safest system

1076
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
to reduce it to the maximum

1077
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
is KYC.

1078
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Everyone who wants to sign up

1079
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
to your service,

1080
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
has to show up personally.

1081
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You have a physical person

1082
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
who checks it.

1083
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You already have

1084
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
some services

1085
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
that are quite elegant

1086
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
with the phone and so on.

1087
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But what?

1088
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
In the end,

1089
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
it's always the trade-off.

1090
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You go to the tech shop...

1091
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Plus, it's not the best

1092
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
for onboarding people.

1093
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Our idea was to enable

1094
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
as many people as possible

1095
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
to come to the platform.

1096
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Specifically, we served

1097
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
as a platform

1098
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
to share your opinion,

1099
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
to have a wide sample.

1100
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And of course,

1101
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the problem is that

1102
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
when you become such an obstacle,

1103
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
you can't get people out of the sample.

1104
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's an additional

1105
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
specificity of our environment.

1106
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But yes, it's a very interesting area.

1107
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yes, now we will

1108
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
conclude this.

1109
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Not for what we would like,

1110
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
but for what we will miss.

1111
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
We are cheap.

1112
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I wanted to say

1113
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
that if people want to contact you,

1114
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
if they want to talk to you,

1115
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
if they go through some

1116
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
beginner's steps,

1117
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
if they really want to know

1118
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
if it's for them,

1119
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
they can contact you,

1120
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
but you don't have Twitter,

1121
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Facebook, Google,

1122
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
phone...

1123
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
In a way, it's understandable

1124
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
why you said that

1125
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
it's a starting point,

1126
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
that there is faith

1127
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
or a way to get

1128
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
some knowledge.

1129
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I am very happy

1130
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
when people start helping.

1131
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I have prepared

1132
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
emails, for example,

1133
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
a beginner's step

1134
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
for someone who would be interested.

1135
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Template?

1136
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Do you give a challenge

1137
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
or is it more like

1138
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
you choose it first,

1139
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
or do you assess it on the basis

1140
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
of the question you get?

1141
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
No, no, the guy made a course.

1142
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
No, no, I didn't go that far.

1143
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But let's say I have the basics for that.

1144
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Some raffles,

1145
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but the point is

1146
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
that a lot of people ask me,

1147
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
a lot of people express interest

1148
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
if I would, and then I'm like

1149
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
oh, the best, I can help you.

1150
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then I have here

1151
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
an email with a pointer

1152
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
for a first step for someone

1153
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
how to go in that direction.

1154
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So yeah, I'm not on Facebook,

1155
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm not on Instagram, I'm not on Twitter.

1156
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
LinkedIn?

1157
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yes, I'm on LinkedIn.

1158
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Thank you, Krištof, for being with us.

1159
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Thank you, Andraž, for your time.

1160
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
If you liked this podcast,

1161
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
please let us know,

1162
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
give us feedback,

1163
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
if it makes sense,

1164
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
if we should do it again.

1165
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Let's talk about a topic.

1166
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yes, a topic.

1167
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Let's not say

1168
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
that we'll know what to say,

1169
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but we'll have an opinion.

1170
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
We'll choose people

1171
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
who have a different opinion,

1172
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
so this debate will look

1173
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
more interesting.

1174
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That's it.

1175
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Ok, it didn't work.

1176
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Bye.
