1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
How did you come up with the idea of doing a podcast?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, at some point our jingle comes together

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then the conversation starts.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you want to have a podcast, you have to have a jingle.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We bought it online.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I thought it was a proper podcast.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I also added lighting to make it look more proper.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The problem with my intro is that at the beginning

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I completely kill the guest and then I leave.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've been preparing and talking for half an hour

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and that's why the intro is so awkward.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The idea was to greet people first.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then I'll say hello.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Where's the camera?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's easier for me.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll say hello and then I'll try to introduce myself.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That was the most awkward intro I've ever done.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, I'll try to continue.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Today we're in Maribor.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I wanted to start the break we did during the summer

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
with some new energy.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's try to have an easy conversation with senior engineers.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've been thinking a lot about who are the top engineers

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
at Steyrsk, who I know and respect

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and who would have something interesting to say.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I decided to talk to you.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've known you for a long time and I know you a bit less.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
At the beginning it was important to introduce myself

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to the people I know.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know you from Databox.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We've been together for about 2 years.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know exactly when you came.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was there from day one.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You worked for Databox.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, I worked for Databox.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I came on a trip and they said there's a guy in Bulgaria

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
who works for iOS.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He has an Apple logo, he's young.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He was the poster boy of Databox.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He was the only one with a widescreen screen

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
so he could see the phone.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I'm still the same.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The director always speaks nicely.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If I understood correctly, you were the one

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
who created the iOS app for Databox.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That was the first version.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes, I'd love to go into details.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Long story short, Databox was Zepelin.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The previous iOS engineer who worked for Zepelin

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
quit when they decided to pivot from Zepelin to Databox.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was 19 at the time.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was a huge iOS geek.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was lucky to have a colleague.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
My job was to develop the app from scratch.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The 1.0 version was just my job.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It was our flagship product

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that kept the company going.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Can you tell us a bit about the time

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
when you were developing the app?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
At the time, Swift wasn't out yet.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Objective-C was out.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
iPhone was out.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was August 2013.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Objective-C was out in August.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Objective-C was out in August.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was a milestone for us

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
when we switched from scale morphism to flat design.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We were using Wave,

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and we had a flat UI.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was a miracle.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I had a plan to find a geek in the summer.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I wanted to go out and do things.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It was a great challenge.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It was the most complex

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and demanding project so far.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It was a great challenge

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and a lot of hype.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you most interested in?

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We'll come back to Inuta.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I know Inuta.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
At some point,

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
someone wrote that there's a company in Slovenia

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that works with Erlang.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They're trying to set up

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
a MySQL base

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
for Erlang.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There's a wizard in Maribor

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
who works with Erlang.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's my first intro to Inuta.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Good intro.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, cool.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm from FACS.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You think about

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
what to do.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You have a bunch of jobs

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
like Java, C-Sharp, etc.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There was a company in Maribor.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A professor from FACS recommended it to me.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He gave me a code for an interview.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They told me they work with Erlang.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wow.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's an absurd thing

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
when you come from FACS and know nothing about it.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It was like

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Sergey and Denis

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
are still experts

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in Erlang.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
In this environment,

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you can learn about Erlang

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
at such a high level.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's the most interesting language ever.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can learn things there

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
that other languages can't.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I got to know Inuta

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
when I came to Ljubljana

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
for a lecture.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We talked about Erlang.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How to write programs in Erlang.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think it was Ruby Crowd.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I know we were all like,

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
what the fuck?

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Even now,

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
concepts are completely different.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Erlang's success

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and the languages that are popular now,

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
like Golang,

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
are the basic concepts of building programs

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that you are capable of.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They are ideal for machines,

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
for full processors,

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
so you can compete.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you know Erlang?

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Not really.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I know the concept,

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
but the multi-training structure is terrible.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a bit like the Ektor model.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Even in Swift.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, in Standard Label.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why?

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
For isolation and multi-training.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ektor isolates your access

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
when it comes to multi-training.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's the same on iPhones.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Phones have full cores,

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but Hyper-Trading on them

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
means more threads per core.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Parallelization is the only useful thing.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Objective-C sheet

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
had CS add-ons,

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
so you could manage all the threads yourself.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
In Swift, in Standard Label,

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you can't just fuck it up.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a 40-year-old concept.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Speaking of debates,

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
can you tell us

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
what's the point of doing

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
a quick course on Erlang?

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's the point?

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why would someone want to learn Erlang?

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What are the examples?

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You need a certain level of reliability,

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and the expressiveness of the language

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
is very high.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Even if you use

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
a design property of the language,

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and use it as you should,

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to always write

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
in a correct flow,

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and let the code fall through.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let it crash, for example.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When computers are growing

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
in the number of CPUs,

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and you want to use all of them,

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Erlang helps a lot.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Erlang builds

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
a scheduler for each core of the processor,

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and then it aligns the processes

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
inside the Erlang virtual machine.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't have to do anything by yourself.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Each process will take the same amount

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
of execution time.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The programs you write

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
are always hierarchical.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You have a supervisor,

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
who can start new processes,

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and they always communicate

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
by sending and receiving messages,

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
because they have their own mailbox.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Each message can be responded to,

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and a new process can be created,

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
or it can fall apart,

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
because the business logic

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
doesn't go through,

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and let the hierarchy crash

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
in a higher process,

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
which decides what will be done.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The whole program is built

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
for one task.

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll give you a practical example

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
of why this language was created

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
in the 1940s.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It was for Ericsson.

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Ericsson managed

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
the telephone switches,

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and if we have a conversation,

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the conversation falls apart

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and the switch can't affect

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the conversation of someone else.

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you work in a CEO,

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
where you have a shared global memory stack,

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
you can have problems with that.

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They built a language

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
from a purely practical example,

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
which is still extremely popular.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WhatsApp was created

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for Goldman Sachs trading,

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
VocaLink MasterCard

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
for Intermediate Payment Systems.

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There are huge problems with that.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This problem is,

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
for example, today we have

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
a micro-service architecture,

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
where you develop your app,

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you have different services,

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and then one service falls apart

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
or you replace it.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
From your perspective,

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
is it a better Erlang model,

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
for example?

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
For people who will listen to this,

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I get similar concepts from micro-services.

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If you look at micro-services,

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
they are applications.

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then you can look at Erlang processes,

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
which are not system processes,

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but micro-processes.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Or micro-services.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So that nothing crashes.

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Everything fits together very well,

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so that you can really

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
work with a reliable system.

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We forgot that at zero.

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
30 minutes on the hard drive.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's cool.

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
For example, if you are deploying

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
an Erlang in a production,

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
does that mean that you put

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the same server on top of the Erlang VM

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and then you deploy a binary

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
in that gross?

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Or do you still communicate with the whole server?

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
One cool thing about Erlang

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is that it was meant

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
to write distributed systems.

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
To write distributed systems

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that can be distributed.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
At this level,

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you need more than one server

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
if you want reliability.

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can cluster them.

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
One good thing about it

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is that these processes

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that have names

267
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
are location-transparent.

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You can send a message

269
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to a local or geographic process

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
at the other end of the world,

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and in Erlang cluster

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
you can send a message

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
without knowing the difference.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Looking at how much experience

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you have with Erlang and the system

276
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
that is 40 years old,

277
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
what is your take on Kubernetes today?

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Do you think it's a re-engineering

279
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
of some concepts?

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Those concepts in other languages

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
didn't exist yet.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You have a bunch of horizontal

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Node.js applications,

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but you won't be able to reach

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the reliability in a different way.

287
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I know that those parts

288
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
are extremely slow.

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They're just OK.

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
In the first version of Erlang,

291
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
could you send a message

292
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
location-independently?

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know about that.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I worked on version 13,

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and now I think it's 26.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It was always like that.

297
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I have an interesting observation.

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think that

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
there are some new languages

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
or new technologies.

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
For example, that the language

303
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
is top-level.

304
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But you also need an ecosystem,

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
a library,

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
which will contribute to the ecosystem.

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
One came from Swift.

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Swift is compatible with Objective-C,

309
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and Objective-C is compatible with C.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In my opinion,

311
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Swift, Objective-C,

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and a bunch of other C++ languages

313
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
are just front-end for the same compiler.

314
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know how much Swift supports.

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I know you have a back-end language.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The answer to your question is

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
interoperability is a big deal for Swift.

318
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You have to assemble it and combine it.

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's the whole point.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That would be my question.

321
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What is the ecosystem of all libraries?

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do I connect the system

323
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
with a traditional Oracle,

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Postgres, MySQL base,

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and use the whole library?

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Or does it have to be separate?

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't know about Erlang,

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
but all the cryptographic tasks,

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
the language would be used in a different way

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
if you had to run those things from the inside.

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It could grow into Rust or C.

332
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll put it this way.

333
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If you go to AWS

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
or to Google Cloud,

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to the GCP,

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the SDK is for 5 languages,

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
but Erlang is not.

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No, it's not.

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You can write Lambda in Erlang.

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I heard you have an original package manager.

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you have one?

342
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes, I do.

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Now Elixir is closer to people.

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is Elixir an abstraction of Erlang?

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes.

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's like a derivative of the same language,

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the same principles,

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
the same syntax.

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Elixir is compiled in Erlang LST,

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and that's it.

351
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You get all the functions of the language.

352
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You can use it in the standard library.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Since Erlang is less popular,

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Elixir is probably more popular.

355
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Ok, cool.

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's talk a bit more about Erlang.

357
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I have a question.

358
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Rust and C++.

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Rust would say that C++ is 20th century,

360
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
that's what Elixir sounds like.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's hard to ask,

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
because I don't know enough.

363
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I find it interesting

364
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
that when you build a standard application

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
in Erlang or Elixir,

366
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
it's nothing unusual

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
to have a couple of million processes

368
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
inside the system that communicate.

369
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
On an ordinary hardware server.

370
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How much resource does it require?

371
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
On a 16 GB machine,

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
you can have 20 million processes.

373
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Even in milliseconds,

374
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
you start a new process.

375
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
One more thing.

376
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I can give you a parallel with Akka.

377
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's my intro to Actor Model.

378
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's Akka.

379
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's on top of Java.

380
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Akka made a framework

381
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
for Actor Model in Scalia.

382
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They made it so it can be used in Java.

383
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Binding was supported for both languages.

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I think it's still supported.

385
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Why didn't you go directly to Erlang?

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Huh? Why didn't I go to Erlang?

387
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Because of the thing I mentioned before.

388
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
At the end of the day,

389
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't want to write libraries

390
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
or have a database driver.

391
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If I want interoperability,

392
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
if I use Akka,

393
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I can use JVM and all the libraries

394
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
from the ecosystem.

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Erlang-X has been open-sourced

396
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
for over 20 years.

397
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
There's a lot of community and libraries.

398
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You have a lot of support.

399
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
In Actor Model,

400
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think the whole concept

401
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
can be viewed

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
as a living basis.

403
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
People model actors.

404
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The real world tries

405
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to model actors.

406
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If we have a chat,

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
during the chat,

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the messages will change

409
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
with other actors.

410
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
If we have a chat room,

411
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
there will be an Indian actor.

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a very simple mental picture

413
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
of the real world.

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
For example,

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Joe Armstrong used

416
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the standard language.

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Joe Armstrong is deceased

418
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
for 50 years.

419
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He wrote that

420
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
all object languages

421
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
violate the rules of physics.

422
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
When you model programs

423
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
or architectures,

424
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you always have to share memory.

425
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If you want something from another object,

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
it has to have some properties

427
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
or values.

428
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Erlang simulates

429
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
a different world.

430
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
If I want something from you,

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I have to ask you,

432
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
you answer me,

433
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I save the information

434
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and I can do whatever I want with it.

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You don't send a message

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
but you invoke it.

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Same, same, but different.

438
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
When you have a concurrency,

439
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you want to share

440
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
the same information.

441
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Everyone tries

442
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to get a share.

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's more time-consuming

444
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and more complex.

445
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
An interesting challenge

446
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
for beginners

447
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
is to send a message

448
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and you can send it back.

449
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The problem is

450
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
when I send a message

451
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and then I wait for you to respond.

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How do you implement it?

453
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
There are a lot of situations

454
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
where you have to

455
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
trade-off later.

456
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's interesting

457
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
because for the new generation of programmers

458
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
there are so many concepts to understand

459
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
when you're learning.

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
When we were learning programming,

461
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
we had a single-core processor

462
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and we had to try to yield

463
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
with a fork or whatever.

464
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It was 40 years ago

465
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
but for a normal person

466
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
who started programming

467
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
we didn't have to learn multi-threading

468
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
or async.

469
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I see that you have

470
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
some of these concepts.

471
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
When I design for a more

472
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
processor-parallel world

473
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I will get feedback

474
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and there are ways

475
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
how JavaScript can be used.

476
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
For example, PHP.

477
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's getting cold.

478
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
These are languages

479
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that have difficulties

480
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
in a world where

481
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
more computing power is needed.

482
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Unless we have some

483
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
PHP circuits.

484
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,880
what is FPM, then we will have more processes and some other collaborations around it.

485
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,160
In my opinion, the problem is that it was added as an afterthought.

486
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,080
New languages ​​appeared, which had it out of the box supported,

487
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,680
and since it was added in the first version, it was also thought out

488
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,040
and incorporated into the language in such a way that it did not bother others.

489
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,920
In other languages, everything was C++, and everyone is still bothered by ASYNC patterns today.

490
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,320
They were just added as an afterthought in more modern libraries,

491
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,360
and then you always have the opportunity to write in the old way,

492
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,639
in the wrong way, depending on some architecture that you have in mind.

493
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:42,959
In my opinion, this is a bigger problem than the fact that they did not support it, and then they did.

494
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:50,720
Now you can make a drink of water, because my next question will be a bomb.

495
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:59,480
My next question will be, how do you explain to your parents what kind of blog you are starting now?

496
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,599
I think the word blockchain has a negative connotation, because it is...

497
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,599
A mortgage?

498
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,599
Yes, I mean...

499
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:27,760
From one perspective, it may not be the right look at it,

500
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,279
but on the other hand, if you look a little more broadly at what it is,

501
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,599
or in which areas it is moving, it makes a lot more sense.

502
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:49,599
I see it as a system of integrity.

503
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:58,599
The world is made up of institutions that project integrity into the world,

504
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,599
and you use these institutions, from banks to public authorities,

505
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:11,600
because a lot of money is also used for audits to project integrity,

506
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,600
and you use these systems.

507
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Blockchain in itself democratizes integrity.

508
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,600
It tells you, okay, here's a ledger, you can issue some programs,

509
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:33,600
you can send some transactions, whether they are monetary or just a state change.

510
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
But the integrity is in your hands.

511
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:43,600
It is in your hands in such a way that you can always join this system and say,

512
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,600
no, I will go from the beginning to the end, to the last block of the blockchain,

513
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,600
and I will see if this system really has the integrity it is talking about,

514
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,600
and I will process all the transactions once again.

515
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Then you have your ledger locally, and you can guarantee that it has the integrity it is talking about.

516
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Are you a fool, Vado?

517
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:21,600
No, but I've been working on it for so long that you have 50 or 100 interviews a month.

518
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Not all DevOps and programmers are from the blockchain.

519
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,600
To be fair, if you follow me on Twitter,

520
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,600
on the X, sorry, if you're on the X, I'll put the hashtag in.

521
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I'll put the link below.

522
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Your posts are very, as Jan said, critical.

523
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,600
For example, when we started this podcast,

524
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,600
people were telling us for a while that there is no one to talk about blockchain and crypto.

525
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,600
At some point, it was very difficult to decide,

526
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,600
because now that everyone has migrated to AI, it's easier because there is less hype.

527
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:20,600
No, but I see that you are constantly with your integrity in this technology.

528
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Capital always attracts a bunch of people who want to do good things with it,

529
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,600
and a bunch of people who don't drink water and don't even drink water for investment.

530
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,600
But generally speaking,

531
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:52,600
the consequences of all the capital in the blockchain will be good things.

532
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,600
From new cryptography, from systems that will be democratized,

533
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
that will be decentralized.

534
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Do you think people believe in it?

535
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I have so many replicas here, I'm constantly jumping from one thing to another.

536
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I agree.

537
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,600
To a large extent, I agree with what you said.

538
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
But the problem is that there are two issues here.

539
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,600
I agree that as a source of truth, the blockchain is a good thing,

540
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
because it is also transparent, etc.

541
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Which is one of the problems that the blockchain decided to address.

542
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Everything else was built on top of that.

543
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,600
But on the other hand, it is a completely digital asset,

544
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,600
a book that doesn't even exist physically.

545
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,600
It doesn't have a real power projection in the world.

546
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Someone will be able to enforce what is written in that book.

547
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
We have now solved the problem that we have a transparent book,

548
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,600
which was certainly not tampered with.

549
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,600
But when it comes to projecting hard power into the real world,

550
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,600
then an institution will stand behind it,

551
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
meaning you have a potential single point of failure.

552
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
But you still hope that the government will solve it.

553
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I said that, at least they ask us in politics.

554
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
And maybe in half an hour.

555
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,600
In half an hour.

556
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
But that's what I see.

557
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,600
I know what you want to say,

558
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,600
but even today there are a lot of things that are purely digital.

559
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Most of the money exists in a digital form,

560
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,600
as it exists in a paper form.

561
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,600
But the government is based on money, right?

562
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Banks.

563
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,600
OK, but when I talked about integrity,

564
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,600
banks go through some stress tests, audits,

565
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Deloitte comes in and does a lot of their processes.

566
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
And their certificates are then sent to the next institution,

567
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,600
which looks at those certificates and says,

568
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,600
OK, this new KBM has integrity and is a good bank,

569
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
and they are liquid and all that stuff.

570
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,600
But these are all centralized institutions,

571
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,600
which don't do anything that can't be calculated,

572
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,600
that can't be turned into a program.

573
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,600
And to certify that program,

574
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,600
or give it some cryptographic power,

575
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,600
they really couldn't steal their books,

576
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,600
because otherwise they wouldn't be able to do it.

577
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
I don't know any more people who say they have it.

578
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,600
So power is exactly in this democratization,

579
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,600
integrity, I think.

580
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Through transparency.

581
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Yes.

582
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Then there are other things,

583
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
for example, the blockchain,

584
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
perhaps not directly sent,

585
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,600
but the consequences of it,

586
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,600
the cryptography that comes,

587
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,600
zero-knowledge cryptography,

588
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
where you participate locally

589
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
in a way that you won't leak your data

590
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
on the Internet or in the world.

591
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,600
You will only prove things.

592
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,600
For example, a very banal example

593
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,600
that will be very close to you,

594
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
is that you pay taxes,

595
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,599
and the fact that you pay an approximate amount of taxes,

596
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,599
you fulfill some tasks, evidence,

597
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,599
they have a view,

598
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,599
if you are a child,

599
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,599
they have a view of your bank account,

600
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:47,599
if you are a physical person,

601
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,599
they don't,

602
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:53,599
but you say you deserve it.

603
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,599
They can get a constant amount of data

604
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,599
about you and your income.

605
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,599
These tasks can be done in such a way

606
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:05,599
that you never give any manager

607
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,599
any details, your personal details,

608
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,599
about your income,

609
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,599
and you show them proof

610
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,599
that they can trust,

611
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,599
and say, OK, everything was done according to our rules.

612
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:23,599
It is a kind of layer,

613
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,599
a set of layers that you talked about.

614
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:29,599
In the end, you only know what the result is,

615
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,599
and you know that the whole process was audited,

616
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,599
or chained,

617
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,599
and you don't know in detail

618
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,599
how the final result came out.

619
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,599
Because you trust mathematicians and cryptographers.

620
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,599
I think this is a better connection than the problem

621
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,599
that blockchain is solving at the moment.

622
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,599
The same Peaches 2829,

623
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,599
or the same screenshot of the same time bank,

624
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,599
or another bailout.

625
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,599
I think this is the only problem that it is currently solving.

626
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,599
Most of the others that blockchain would solve at the moment

627
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,599
are either an institution

628
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,599
that will project hard power into the world,

629
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,599
or I just do everything.

630
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,599
Full disclaimer for the listeners,

631
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,599
I have been preparing this for 2.12 for a long time,

632
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,599
and I still believe in blockchain as it is.

633
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,599
But for me it is exploitation,

634
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,599
where 99.9% of the projects and things

635
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,599
that exist on the blockchain today,

636
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,599
are not used.

637
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,599
Yes, but that does not mean that this exploitation is stopped,

638
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:41,599
but this system is not exploitable,

639
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,599
it is not different from any other.

640
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,599
That is true.

641
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,599
I would describe it as a technology in captivity,

642
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,599
because the banks we have today

643
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,599
did not emerge in the 15th century,

644
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:59,599
as we now have a blockchain,

645
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,599
but they have developed over the centuries

646
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,599
to the level we need today,

647
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,599
and in my opinion, crypto still needs some time.

648
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,599
I think that banks will eventually

649
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,599
not be able to do anything

650
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:17,599
based on the systems

651
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,599
that are based on the blockchain.

652
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,599
Maybe they won't be able to communicate

653
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,599
and talk about it in the beginning?

654
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,599
No, it will be all present and not relevant at all.

655
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,599
So we have an oracle in our base,

656
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,599
we have a blockchain,

657
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,599
and it will be business as usual.

658
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,599
Isn't that a goal?

659
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,599
Yes, that is a good benefit.

660
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,599
But again, no matter how much you have to work,

661
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,599
we know that you have to.

662
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:53,599
But if there is evidence,

663
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,599
it will be proof that it is time to work

664
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,599
and it will reinforce people on the blockchain.

665
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,599
If you have something to take.

666
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,599
I agree, but that's exactly what I want to say.

667
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,599
I agree that writing will be more transparent

668
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,599
but you still have to work

669
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,599
and someone has to decide.

670
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,599
Let's talk a little bit about

671
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,599
the application of technology.

672
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,599
Technology is a business logic,

673
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,599
if you want,

674
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:29,599
and not everything is straight.

675
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,599
Somewhere there is a barrier that ends.

676
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,599
If you download Postgres,

677
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,599
you have a good base,

678
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:41,599
but you don't have business logic.

679
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,599
But that's a good point.

680
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,599
Let's go one more layer from the blockchain.

681
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,599
If I understand correctly,

682
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,599
you also do a lot with Ethereum, right?

683
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,599
Exclusively.

684
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,599
Exclusively with Ethereum.

685
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,599
Can you introduce it a little bit?

686
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:05,599
If we talked about Erlang VM,

687
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,599
Ethereum is also a virtual machine.

688
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:11,599
If I understand correctly.

689
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,599
It is.

690
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,599
And you pay for the use of this virtual machine.

691
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,599
Can you tell us more about it?

692
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,599
I don't want to ask more questions.

693
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,599
IBM is also a good company.

694
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,599
Now,

695
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,599
you can look at Ethereum or at the blockchain

696
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:35,599
as if you were on a fax machine

697
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,599
and you were doing procedures.

698
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,599
You learned to write procedures on a pencil.

699
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,599
I find this very interesting

700
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,599
because Ethereum roadmap has changed a bit

701
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,599
because they wanted to shard,

702
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,599
execution and so on.

703
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,599
Now it's really a base

704
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,599
and a data availability base

705
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,599
for all possible scalability approaches.

706
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,599
What is the problem with Ethereum?

707
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,599
Tell us what the advantage is.

708
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:17,599
Before we go to the distance.

709
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,599
The advantage is that

710
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,599
you can write a program.

711
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,599
The program will deploy to the chain.

712
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,599
It will live there

713
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,599
and anyone can use it.

714
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,599
Can you see the code?

715
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,599
You can see the code.

716
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,599
Explorer always shows bytecode.

717
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,599
If you verify the program

718
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,599
then you have the source.

719
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,599
This source can be complex

720
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,599
and then people use

721
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,599
some applications

722
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,599
that pull the enemy

723
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,599
and steal their money.

724
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,599
From this point of view,

725
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,599
you have to be careful

726
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,599
with which things you deal with.

727
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,599
In general, it is a transparent system

728
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,599
that allows you to deploy programs.

729
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,599
Back in the day,

730
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,599
you could get a Solidity contract

731
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,599
and find exploits.

732
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,599
It was full of hacks.

733
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,599
These simple contracts

734
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,599
were hacked through chatGPTN.

735
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,599
This is the reliability

736
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,599
of people who are users of Ethereum

737
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,599
and define these contracts.

738
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,599
These are mathematical errors

739
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,599
or logical bugs.

740
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,599
Division by zero.

741
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,599
As a programmer,

742
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,599
when you write another code

743
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,599
and you make a bug,

744
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,599
similar problems are here.

745
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,599
Transparency, which is offered by EVM,

746
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,599
is phenomenal.

747
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,599
If we were there

748
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:25,599
for a basic blockchain transaction,

749
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,599
you can verify the history of calls

750
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,599
and what happened.

751
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,599
There is a level of abstraction

752
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,599
above the blockchain,

753
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,599
but it doesn't threaten humanity.

754
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,599
If you offer functionality on EVM,

755
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,599
you can make a bug

756
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:49,599
and exploit it.

757
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,599
Since you have a copy of the chain,

758
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,599
you can localize it

759
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,599
and make a rollback

760
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,599
with the entire interaction

761
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,599
with the contract.

762
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:07,599
It depends on the input and output

763
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,599
of the state,

764
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:13,599
but you can see it in the beginning.

765
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,599
You can see everything.

766
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,599
Let's say we use Ethereum

767
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,599
as the backbone of our bank.

768
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,599
Everyone can see the contracts

769
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,599
that we will write.

770
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,599
Everyone sees inputs and outputs.

771
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,599
Before we hid everything

772
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,599
and later it was public.

773
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,599
That's why you want to be sure

774
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,599
that the contracts you have don't have a bug.

775
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,599
No, that's not the case.

776
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,599
The privacy of the enterprise is not.

777
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,599
People are aware of this

778
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,599
and work on it.

779
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,599
Exactly.

780
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,599
If there are zero-proof systems,

781
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,599
we can't do anything.

782
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,599
Now my question is,

783
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,599
what are the advantages of Ethereum?

784
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,599
Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain

785
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,599
that optimizes itself

786
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,599
against decentralization.

787
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,599
As many people as possible

788
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,599
can participate

789
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,599
in this distributed database.

790
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,599
Is it a data-driven database?

791
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,599
Yes, it is.

792
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,599
That's why Ethereum has four limitations.

793
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,599
How many transactions can be processed,

794
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,599
how fast are the blocks,

795
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,599
what size are the blocks,

796
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,599
because the design is designed

797
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,599
so that everyone can participate

798
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,599
on their laptop in the ecosystem

799
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,599
and you can be a staker

800
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:01,599
and validate the blockchain.

801
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,599
This is a penalty for performance.

802
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:07,599
Part of the roadmap was

803
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,599
sharding and execution sharding.

804
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,599
This turned out to be

805
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,599
an extremely difficult problem.

806
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:19,599
In 2018

807
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,599
Vitalik announced

808
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,599
that this roadmap would change

809
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,599
and that Ethereum would go

810
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,599
in the direction of

811
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,599
roll-up scaling.

812
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,599
This is what I mentioned before,

813
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,599
where Ethereum becomes

814
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,599
the database and data availability layer

815
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,599
for these roll-ups.

816
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:49,599
Roll-ups are basically

817
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,599
a container for Ethereum.

818
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:55,599
150 years ago

819
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,599
we invented a container

820
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,599
for this roll-up.

821
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,599
Now you can do

822
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:07,599
a lot of things

823
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,599
on the same roll-up

824
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:13,599
and unload them much faster

825
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,599
and the roll-up can move forward.

826
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,599
These are roll-ups.

827
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,599
Roll-ups are external systems

828
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,599
in Ethereum

829
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,599
that do not yet have

830
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,599
but will have

831
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,599
the security of Ethereum itself

832
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:37,599
with economic games

833
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,599
and cryptography.

834
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,599
Is it 2D?

835
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,599
Yes, it's 2D.

836
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,599
I'm specifically familiar

837
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,599
with optimistic roll-ups.

838
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,599
Optimistic roll-ups work

839
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,599
in the same way as

840
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,599
execution clients in Ethereum

841
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,599
and then they modify it a little

842
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:13,599
specifically for bedrock.

843
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,599
Optimistic roll-ups

844
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:19,599
give a small footprint

845
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,599
on the code of the execution client

846
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,599
and then process transactions,

847
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,599
batch them,

848
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:31,599
compress them

849
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,599
and then post them

850
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:37,599
on Ethereum as call data.

851
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,599
The economic part of all this

852
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,599
is that it enables you

853
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,599
to use the system

854
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,599
in your interest

855
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:55,599
to participate

856
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,599
in the network

857
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,599
as a validator.

858
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,599
The validator takes the transactions

859
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:07,599
directly from us or our roll-up

860
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,599
or takes them directly from Ethereum

861
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,599
and recomputes them.

862
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,599
It takes each transaction separately

863
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:19,599
and applies it to its ledger.

864
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,599
Then there is another component

865
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:25,599
in this roll-up called the proposer.

866
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,599
The proposer takes the batches

867
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:31,599
of all the batches,

868
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,599
and the validators do the same

869
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,599
and compare the Merkle hash root

870
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,599
that was posted on Ethereum

871
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:43,599
and their local one.

872
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,599
They say, hey, everything is OK

873
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,599
or hey, something went wrong

874
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,599
and then they play the dispute game.

875
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:55,599
The dispute game is where you challenge

876
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,599
a specific entity

877
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:01,599
for a specific transaction

878
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,599
and you want to prove

879
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:07,599
that you beat someone.

880
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,599
The economic part of all this

881
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:13,599
is that the sequencer

882
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,599
can stake, the challenger

883
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,599
can stake in ETH or USD

884
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,599
and play this game

885
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,599
or get a stake from someone else.

886
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,599
This is one approach.

887
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,599
The other approach is

888
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,599
zero-knowledge roll-ups

889
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:37,599
which I can talk about if you want.

890
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,599
Now I will calm down a bit

891
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,599
and I will say

892
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,599
if I didn't have a job

893
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:49,599
and I was one of those 50

894
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,599
who interviewed for positions

895
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:55,599
what would I ask?

896
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,599
How do you check people you interview?

897
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:01,599
What position?

898
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,599
I'm already dissed in blockchain.

899
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:07,599
If I wasn't dissed in blockchain

900
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,599
what position?

901
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,599
Software architect or senior engineer?

902
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,599
He has a lot of experience

903
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:19,599
but he is a blockchain skeptic.

904
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,599
One interesting thing about these roll-ups

905
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,599
is that in the process of development

906
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,599
some things are missing.

907
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,599
Decentralization of the roll-up is missing.

908
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,599
If you look at Ethereum

909
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:37,599
and the clients

910
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,599
who chase Ethereum

911
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:43,599
they are isolated entities

912
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,599
and these clients are not reliable.

913
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:49,599
Postgres, RoxDB, LevelDB

914
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,599
file-based storage

915
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:55,599
and the client's base reliability

916
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,599
is not at any entity.

917
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
but in decentralization, everyone has a copy of the data,

918
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,880
and that data goes through peer-to-peer,

919
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,800
through the entire network, and you have a copy of that ledger.

920
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,520
So Jan has to know Java.

921
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,520
Well, yes.

922
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,160
And then the interesting question is,

923
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,680
as an entity that develops a role,

924
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,480
and is in the process of decentralizing it,

925
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,440
we only have one copy of that sequencer,

926
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,119
how can we design that role in AWS Cloud,

927
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,119
and the applications we deploy,

928
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,919
so that their storage is fully reliable,

929
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:51,599
and that if a region in AWS goes down,

930
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,599
so that we don't lose that disk and then...

931
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,240
Oops.

932
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,040
Blockchain.

933
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,360
Yes, I mean, blockchain is not a solution because...

934
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,120
I mean, it's not a solution because we post things on Ethereum.

935
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,800
We post those things on Ethereum with a lag.

936
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,080
And they're still parked, or they're cut off.

937
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,360
Yes, you can decompress them and re-apply them.

938
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,239
But there's always a lag, because you're collecting...

939
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:24,080
Our direct cost as a company is all the transactions

940
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,400
that we post on Layer 1, that's our cost,

941
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,639
which is paid by the FIA to the user.

942
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:34,639
But there's always a lag.

943
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:38,160
There can be 15-20 minutes of transactions

944
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,720
that we collect in batches and then post them,

945
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,360
which are not there yet.

946
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,480
You have them in your local storage.

947
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,680
And what's the catch here?

948
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:58,559
Today, in the cloud, you know that stateless applications are designed.

949
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,680
And then you have those bases that allow you to replicate it

950
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,360
in your own design.

951
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,080
You don't have that here.

952
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:10,679
What can you do for a stateful application to be safe?

953
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:12,800
Yes, Jan, what do you think?

954
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,720
Sure.

955
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,240
Wait, I forgot, now I'm on a job interview.

956
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,240
This is such a strange place for me.

957
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:26,880
This is, for example, when we employ infrastructure people.

958
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,679
It's good to know such things.

959
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:31,600
But what's your stack?

960
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,320
Do you do it in C, C++, Go?

961
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,039
Execution client, Golang, Typescript.

962
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:41,679
And you can't do it in NDA?

963
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:44,919
No, everything we do is open source.

964
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:49,960
This research part that we do for zero-knowledge things.

965
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,080
I thought it was brilliant, technically very interesting.

966
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,000
But do you have a side or do you develop it with your own capital

967
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,559
and as some kind of research?

968
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,160
Or is that an approximate question?

969
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,360
No, it's a great question.

970
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,479
All these roles are actually developer platforms.

971
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:18,000
You have retail users who come to manage your Uniswap deployment,

972
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,240
because there is an exchange there, and they trade.

973
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,960
These can be purely users.

974
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,559
They can be an enterprise fund that comes to invest in you.

975
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:32,639
On the other hand, you have projects that are purely companies

976
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:38,440
that manage your platform because of some features you have.

977
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,679
But all this is permissionless.

978
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:44,839
You don't have to ask anything if you can deploy, right?

979
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:47,759
Go ahead.

980
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:52,119
Can you tell us what Layer 2 is in Ethereum?

981
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:55,960
If I could say that at the beginning, that this is Layer 2.

982
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,199
Are you an optimistic role? Or a zero-knowledge...

983
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:03,839
I would say the same thing.

984
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,960
Ethereum and blockchain, the big technical challenge of these technologies

985
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:14,960
are too late to be able to write some transactions in real time

986
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,559
to validate them correctly.

987
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:25,559
We need to build a technology, an abstraction layer above Ethereum,

988
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,959
above this basic technology, and then it's called Layer 2.

989
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:35,200
Layer 2 are applications that operate outside of Ethereum,

990
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
and then part of Ethereum...

991
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
Am I interpreting this correctly?

992
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
Yes, everything is part of Ethereum.

993
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Physics hasn't changed here.

994
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,200
You start a startup with a monolithic application,

995
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,200
and then you set up nodes, and then you get pages.

996
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Something needs to be changed, because it's too late now,

997
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,200
and then you start selling out some things, for example.

998
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,200
There is no approach.

999
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,200
I would describe it lightly,

1000
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,200
if I remember correctly.

1001
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
It's like this.

1002
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,200
In the middle is the blockchain,

1003
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,200
the base that provides you with the truth state, the ground state.

1004
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,200
Ethereum EBM is a script for nodes that run on this base.

1005
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,200
It means that you are prepared for your virtual machine to have transparency.

1006
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,200
Then you have L2,

1007
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,200
which can be domain-specific for nodes.

1008
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,200
It doesn't have to be necessary just to increase their throughput.

1009
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,200
You can take a page, sell it out,

1010
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,200
create a high-performance app for that specific task.

1011
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,200
For the most part, these are transactions and so on.

1012
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,200
For example, if you want Bitcoin for Lightning and so on.

1013
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,200
And then, when you are satisfied with your work,

1014
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,200
on your L2, you conclude something,

1015
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,200
and then you start processing it on L1,

1016
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
that is, on EVM.

1017
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,200
Hard.

1018
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Hard.

1019
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
It's more light.

1020
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
Yes, that's true.

1021
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,200
One thing that is important here is that this L1, like Ethereum,

1022
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:13,200
must have some ability to execute programs,

1023
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,200
because otherwise you can't control this security.

1024
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,200
Otherwise, these L2 systems can't be secure.

1025
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
You have nothing from the blockchain.

1026
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,200
You can use them as storage,

1027
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,200
but you also need a fairly powerful ability

1028
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,200
to execute these proofs or cryptographies,

1029
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,200
when you need to prove something,

1030
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,200
regarding the system that is alerted.

1031
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Okay.

1032
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,200
Now, to be time-cautious.

1033
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:55,200
Jan, I still see you as an IOS, Apple superstar.

1034
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,200
Maybe that's why you won't go to the blockchain.

1035
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,200
Or maybe you will, but I don't know.

1036
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
I mean, let's go to the blockchain.

1037
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
I also wanted to talk about these contracts and so on.

1038
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
I find it interesting.

1039
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,200
We really got into this.

1040
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,200
I will try to get this debate out of the way a bit.

1041
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,200
We probably already lost a lot of listeners

1042
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,200
because we skipped most of it.

1043
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Okay.

1044
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
I will take this point and say that

1045
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
if you find these people interesting,

1046
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,200
if you would like us to continue

1047
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,200
doing high-quality production of technology talks

1048
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,200
with interesting speakers,

1049
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,200
if you want us to be a technology company,

1050
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,200
please support us on Patreon.

1051
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,200
There you will also get perks as a premium subscriber to Patreon,

1052
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,200
for example, to get pre-premium subscriptions

1053
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
on all public channels,

1054
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
and also, I don't know, video, audio,

1055
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
and buy some perks there.

1056
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,200
You can support us there.

1057
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,200
It will help us a lot.

1058
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,200
It is also possible in Grodno

1059
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,200
because of the support of two companies.

1060
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,200
The company Trifas and Humanfrog support us.

1061
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,200
So thank you for that.

1062
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,200
That's some kind of commercial aspect

1063
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
that I have to add.

1064
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
Look, stop.

1065
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,200
Advertisement.

1066
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,200
Advertisement.

1067
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Advertisement.

1068
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,200
Maybe I could say at the beginning

1069
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,200
that if you are watching this on YouTube,

1070
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,200
go there and subscribe.

1071
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,200
I agree that at the beginning

1072
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,200
everyone was like 15, 15, 15, 15.

1073
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Ad block.

1074
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,200
Let's learn.

1075
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Fun fact.

1076
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,200
You can also buy a premium subscription on YouTube.

1077
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
For VPN, you give the country to Argentina

1078
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
or some third world country,

1079
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
and there is a monthly subscription, like $1.

1080
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
And then there is an ad,

1081
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
and you can take a family package,

1082
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,200
and you have like 5 accounts.

1083
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Life hack.

1084
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Just saying.

1085
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Damn.

1086
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,200
Just saying.

1087
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Amazing.

1088
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,200
More VPN.

1089
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,200
I don't need them

1090
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
because they are ultra-commercialized

1091
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,200
and need full advertising.

1092
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,200
So no.

1093
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Someone who is a little less known.

1094
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,200
But yeah.

1095
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Sorry about that.

1096
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,200
No, it's cool.

1097
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,200
It's cool.

1098
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Now...

1099
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Another fun fact.

1100
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,200
You can also...

1101
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
I had a pie hole on my home network.

1102
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,200
And you can also configure a proxy

1103
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
so that YouTube, ad,

1104
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,200
shoots out.

1105
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,200
I mean, everyone comes to my network

1106
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,200
and then blocks the domain.

1107
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,200
Pie hole.

1108
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Today...

1109
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Okay.

1110
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
Is this legal?

1111
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
No, it's not.

1112
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
It was brought in.

1113
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,200
Yeah, okay.

1114
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,200
Then it's not a problem.

1115
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Hey, I had here...

1116
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Fun fact.

1117
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,200
I wrote to you.

1118
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,200
I was watching you.

1119
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,200
We've known each other for a while.

1120
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,200
I wrote to you.

1121
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Fun fact.

1122
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
It says...

1123
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
TNT.

1124
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
Autotemperature.

1125
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Yeah.

1126
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,200
I'll put it here.

1127
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Then I have here written...

1128
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,200
Civilian.

1129
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,200
Maybe...

1130
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,200
I don't know what it stands for.

1131
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,200
But...

1132
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,200
I might make a segway out of it.

1133
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,200
When you were my partner in a company...

1134
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
You were my boss before.

1135
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,200
Before...

1136
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,200
No, when I was already your boss.

1137
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,200
There was...

1138
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Every year, at the end of...

1139
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,200
At the beginning of December,

1140
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Advent of Code starts.

1141
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
I think you'll know that.

1142
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,200
And I challenged the team.

1143
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,200
The one who solves Advent of Code

1144
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,200
gets a jacket.

1145
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
And...

1146
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,200
And Jan is...

1147
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,200
Slop trade.

1148
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
And Jan replaced a December

1149
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
with a jacket bottle.

1150
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,200
Which he also got, of course.

1151
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Because he solved the whole Advent of Code.

1152
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Which language?

1153
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Which language?

1154
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,200
Which language?

1155
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,200
Which language was it?

1156
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,200
I think it was Swift.

1157
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,200
But I took Rust.

1158
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
I'm not sure.

1159
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,200
I worked with Rust for a year.

1160
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,200
Will you...

1161
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,200
First tell me what it is.

1162
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Yeah, sure.

1163
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,200
I think it's weird

1164
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,200
when we went ultra in-depth.

1165
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
I have to fool people here.

1166
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,200
But...

1167
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,200
In short, yeah.

1168
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Advent of Code is...

1169
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,200
Like Advent Calendar.

1170
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,200
But instead of 25-day chocolates,

1171
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,200
there are...

1172
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Programming problems.

1173
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
I don't know.

1174
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,200
There are algorithms and such

1175
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,200
for development.

1176
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
And on December 1st,

1177
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,200
it starts on easy.

1178
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,200
On the 25th...

1179
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
I mean, on the 10th,

1180
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
you don't want to run into it.

1181
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
And then, yeah.

1182
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
There are always more complex problems.

1183
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,200
And that's it.

1184
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
Advent of Code is actually...

1185
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
It works every time.

1186
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,200
And...

1187
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,200
It's a little more mechanical.

1188
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,200
Yeah, sure.

1189
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,200
So, yeah.

1190
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
I mean, for anyone,

1191
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
programming is a hobby.

1192
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,200
You like to deal with complex problems.

1193
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,200
But the idea of Advent of Code is

1194
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,200
that you have a page

1195
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
where a problem is submitted.

1196
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,200
And it's purely...

1197
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
How would I put it?

1198
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
Logically described in a way

1199
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
that anyone can understand it.

1200
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,200
But looking for a solution

1201
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,200
is complex.

1202
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,200
I mean,

1203
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,200
it's not based on the fact

1204
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,200
that you can use any language.

1205
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
They give you some input.

1206
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
I don't know.

1207
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,200
A banal example

1208
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,200
of such a very initial problem was...

1209
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
We have a person

1210
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
who drives a car.

1211
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,200
And every time

1212
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,200
one of the lines is higher,

1213
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,200
we have an overlap.

1214
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,200
And every time

1215
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
one of the lines is lower,

1216
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,200
we have an overlap.

1217
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,200
And then,

1218
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,200
they give you some input

1219
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
on the line

1220
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
where the person

1221
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
finished the line.

1222
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
And that's at the beginning.

1223
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
So, basically,

1224
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
you can just...

1225
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,200
Command F,

1226
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,200
and then look

1227
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
at how many are overlapping

1228
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,200
and how many are overlapping.

1229
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
You calculate the difference.

1230
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,200
I mean,

1231
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,200
that's how it starts.

1232
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,200
It doesn't depend on the language.

1233
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,200
It doesn't depend on

1234
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,200
your problem solver.

1235
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,200
You can solve

1236
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,200
any problem

1237
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,200
any time.

1238
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,200
And all problems

1239
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
are based in this way.

1240
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
And then,

1241
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,200
it's up to you

1242
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,200
how you're going to solve it

1243
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,200
as quickly as possible.

1244
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,200
Because the first 100

1245
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,200
also get some points.

1246
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,200
And then...

1247
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,200
In December,

1248
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
you have an Amazon interview.

1249
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Yeah,

1250
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
with the fact that...

1251
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,200
Yeah, basically, yeah.

1252
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,200
I mean,

1253
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,200
now...

1254
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,200
I mean,

1255
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Advent of Code,

1256
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,200
I'll put the link below.

1257
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,200
Now,

1258
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,200
if you're on those

1259
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Slovenian

1260
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
technical social networks,

1261
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
you also have people

1262
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,200
who become

1263
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,200
solutions

1264
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
for that.

1265
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,200
Yeah.

1266
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Yeah.

1267
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
And then,

1268
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,200
you also solve

1269
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,200
at the beginning

1270
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,200
with a lot of enthusiasm.

1271
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
And it's very...

1272
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,200
Complexity falls.

1273
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
And those who

1274
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,200
go very far,

1275
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,200
prepare themselves

1276
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,200
a lot.

1277
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
Yeah.

1278
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Yeah.

1279
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
I mean,

1280
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,200
I see it

1281
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,200
as a hobby.

1282
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
I would describe it

1283
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
like this.

1284
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
The first five days,

1285
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
people still argue

1286
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,200
with those

1287
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,200
who have a faster algorithm,

1288
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,200
those who have

1289
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,200
more performance.

1290
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,200
It's the same.

1291
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,200
There,

1292
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,200
after 10-15 days,

1293
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,200
you're like,

1294
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,200
yeah, I solved it,

1295
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,200
but it took me half a day

1296
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,200
for that.

1297
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,200
And you're just happy.

1298
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,200
And in practice,

1299
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
it's exponential.

1300
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
Yeah.

1301
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,200
But it's like...

1302
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,200
Because I got the feeling

1303
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
that it's like this.

1304
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
Something is easier,

1305
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
then harder,

1306
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
and a little...

1307
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,200
Yeah, all in all...

1308
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
That's what I experienced.

1309
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,200
I mean, all in all,

1310
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,200
I don't know if the problems

1311
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
are easier,

1312
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,200
but I don't know.

1313
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,200
It's hard to describe.

1314
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
Anyway,

1315
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,200
every year it's a different

1316
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,200
topic and

1317
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,200
you don't follow the problems

1318
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,200
exactly,

1319
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,200
but there,

1320
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,200
I would say,

1321
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,200
after the tenth day,

1322
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,200
you still have two or three

1323
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
problems that are relatively

1324
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,200
simple.

1325
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
The rest,

1326
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
you're still chasing

1327
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
until December.

1328
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
And I also see that

1329
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,200
the problem is also...

1330
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,200
I mean,

1331
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,200
the problem.

1332
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,200
For me,

1333
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
there was a problem

1334
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,200
because it opens

1335
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,200
at 6 AM

1336
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
or 5 AM

1337
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
in our time.

1338
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,200
6 AM.

1339
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
Yeah,

1340
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,200
and if I go to bed

1341
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,200
in the morning,

1342
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,200
then I have a family,

1343
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,200
a job,

1344
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
and everything.

1345
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
And then,

1346
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,200
I don't know,

1347
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,200
at 10 PM

1348
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,200
I have to solve it.

1349
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
I don't know how

1350
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,200
the fans were waiting for you.

1351
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,200
At 6 AM?

1352
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
Yeah, yeah.

1353
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,200
Do you have to do it

1354
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,200
until the end of the day?

1355
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,200
No,

1356
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
I mean,

1357
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,200
I have to do my thing

1358
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,200
until 10 AM,

1359
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,200
and then go to sleep

1360
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
on the next morning.

1361
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,200
But I didn't have

1362
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,200
to do it till that time.

1363
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,200
You just have to do

1364
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,200
it in one or two weeks,

1365
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
or something like that,

1366
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,200
then the problem opens

1367
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,200
globally.

1368
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,200
Yes.

1369
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
And then,

1370
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,200
the first hundred

1371
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,200
are the ones

1372
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,200
solving the problem

1373
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,200
the fastest.

1374
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,200
And then,

1375
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,200
it doesn't depend

1376
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
on where you are.

1377
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
I just remember

1378
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
that I woke up

1379
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
at 6 AM every morning

1380
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
and then the first thing

1381
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,200
on my head changed.

1382
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
Yeah, yeah.

1383
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,200
I was just

1384
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,200
a brain-scrambler

1385
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,200
until 10 AM,

1386
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,200
11 AM,

1387
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,200
until 12 AM,

1388
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
I was just doing that

1389
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,200
and then I started

1390
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,200
doing other things.

1391
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,200
Ah, okay.

1392
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,200
Yeah.

1393
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
What would be

1394
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
my shift?

1395
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
No, no,

1396
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,200
it wasn't like that.

1397
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
No, no, it wasn't.

1398
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Sorry, it wasn't.

1399
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Please explain.

1400
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,200
What is our output?

1401
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,200
No, no,

1402
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
it doesn't really

1403
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,200
matter anymore.

1404
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,200
The company

1405
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,200
will clarify it,

1406
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,200
probably.

1407
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,200
I was in the same company

1408
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,200
as back then.

1409
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,200
I started as someone

1410
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,200
who would be

1411
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
the leader of mobile development

1412
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,200
and would develop

1413
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,200
a mobile application.

1414
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Which one will it be?

1415
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,200
We'll see.

1416
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,200
You're right,

1417
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,200
you've seen everything.

1418
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
The main thing is

1419
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,200
that we prepared

1420
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,200
for a while,

1421
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,200
and maybe

1422
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
we wouldn't have

1423
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,200
a mobile application

1424
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,200
and then

1425
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,200
Jan started

1426
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
some other things

1427
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,200
that were exciting.

1428
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,200
The only thing

1429
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,200
that wasn't.

1430
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
The only thing

1431
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
that wasn't.

1432
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
Look,

1433
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
I don't know,

1434
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,200
I don't think

1435
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,200
you've come across

1436
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
that.

1437
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200
I have a lot

1438
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,200
of questions.

1439
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,200
Everything we've

1440
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,200
talked about,

1441
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,200
you're a top

1442
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,200
programmer,

1443
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
I mean,

1444
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,200
I would ask you

1445
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,200
if you could

1446
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
answer me

1447
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
on how

1448
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
you train,

1449
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
or how

1450
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,200
you make

1451
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,200
sure

1452
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
you're

1453
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
sharp

1454
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,200
in your

1455
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
skill sets,

1456
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
or you could

1457
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
tell me

1458
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
what

1459
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,200
project

1460
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,200
you have

1461
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,200
that would

1462
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
be suitable

1463
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,200
for that.

1464
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,200
I'll ask

1465
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,200
you first.

1466
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,200
How does

1467
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,200
Ino train?

1468
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,200
I wanted

1469
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,200
him to

1470
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,200
explain

1471
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,200
to me

1472
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,200
that

1473
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,200
he's

1474
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,200
a

1475
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,200
genius,

1476
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,200
and

1477
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,200
he's

1478
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,200
a

1479
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,200
genius

1480
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
in

1481
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
general.

1482
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,200
And

1483
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,200
he would

1484
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
explain

1485
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
that

1486
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
he's

1487
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,200
a

1488
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,200
genius

1489
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,200
in

1490
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
general.

1491
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
And

1492
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,200
he would

1493
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
explain

1494
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,200

that

1989
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,199
he's

1990
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,199
a

1991
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:01,199
genius

1992
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It's not a trivial question.

1993
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:12,560
I don't think there's a reason why, if we were children, we wouldn't learn how to program.

1994
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:19,520
I think it gives you a logical capacity, which is useful and can be very fun.

1995
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,520
I agree.

1996
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,520
I wouldn't have to spend time with my children in that way. Perfect. I think it's great.

1997
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:37,520
Even if you're an AI engineer, your job is to solve problems.

1998
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:43,520
Programming is one way of solving problems.

1999
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,520
If you want someone to be a mechanic, you have to learn how to solve problems.

2000
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,520
You don't know what an AI job will look like in 10 years.

2001
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,520
The best thing you can give him is to learn the tools that exist today,

2002
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:01,520
so that he has a mindset that he won't ask for a GPT, but that he will know how to solve problems himself.

2003
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,519
That's how I would quantify it.

2004
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,519
I agree completely.

2005
01:16:07,519 --> 01:16:15,519
I saw a very interesting system of how people integrate and solve problems with GPTMs.

2006
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:17,519
GPTN.

2007
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:21,519
Thank you for reminding me.

2008
01:16:21,519 --> 01:16:31,519
You build a pipeline, you write a code locally,

2009
01:16:31,519 --> 01:16:35,519
you build an input, you send the input to it,

2010
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:39,519
you say, for example, this is my base structure.

2011
01:16:39,519 --> 01:16:43,519
The base structure will act as a language model.

2012
01:16:43,519 --> 01:16:49,519
Then you get the answer, and then the local layer on your side does the data production,

2013
01:16:49,519 --> 01:16:53,519
and then sends it back to the interpreter to do the production.

2014
01:16:53,519 --> 01:17:01,519
Pipelines and integrations are something that we see as a next level,

2015
01:17:01,519 --> 01:17:03,519
because I see that a lot is happening now.

2016
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:11,520
A lot of people started building layers around GPT.

2017
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,520
They don't know that we actually use it,

2018
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,520
but it's hidden behind and generated in a query or something.

2019
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,520
It's similar to L2 for IBM, which we talked about earlier.

2020
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,520
You use a product where you don't know that the blockchain is below,

2021
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,520
but it's not important in the end.

2022
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,520
It's a new vector to solve problems in some way,

2023
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,520
if I understand you correctly.

2024
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,520
A fun fact, a more mindfuck application,

2025
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,520
AI, for example, is a company called Lightmass,

2026
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,520
I don't know if you're Slovenians,

2027
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:53,520
where they found out that you can encode 3D spaces in a neural network.

2028
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:59,520
They imagined a video game where you could have a gigabyte of textures,

2029
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,520
objects, and so on, which were rendered on a computer screen.

2030
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,520
Now you have an AI that is encoded in the whole level,

2031
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,520
and you feed it the position, very logically,

2032
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,520
and then 3D pictures of what the space looks like in that area,

2033
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,520
and there are much smaller levels, if you know what I mean.

2034
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,520
It's like an alternative to compression.

2035
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,520
The levels are big, I don't know what it's called,

2036
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,520
20 gigs for 1 gig, and the performance is absurd,

2037
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,520
and so on, it's a very interesting thing.

2038
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,520
So AI is like that.

2039
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,520
I think that as a back-end, you use a lot of GPT,

2040
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,520
and you limit yourself.

2041
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,520
It's a hot topic now,

2042
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,520
it's where you get money, where you cut cash and so on,

2043
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,520
but it's still not a silver bullet for all the problems.

2044
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,520
I still have a file on my disk,

2045
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:54,520
where you once made a self-driving car.

2046
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,520
I remember that demo.

2047
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,520
You took a video, and then...

2048
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
I recorded a video.

2049
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,520
You recorded a video and made a self-driving car.

2050
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,520
What happened to that project?

2051
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,520
It was a hobby.

2052
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,520
It was a time when you could program.

2053
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,520
Long story short,

2054
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,519
I made a car that had radar cruise control.

2055
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,519
It was interesting,

2056
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:22,519
and then I wanted to understand how these problems work.

2057
01:19:22,519 --> 01:19:25,519
At the time, there was no AI in it.

2058
01:19:25,519 --> 01:19:28,519
It was all heuristics, math, and similar problems.

2059
01:19:28,519 --> 01:19:29,519
Why did this happen?

2060
01:19:29,519 --> 01:19:30,519
Nothing.

2061
01:19:30,519 --> 01:19:32,519
I developed a proof-of-concept,

2062
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:34,519
and it stayed there.

2063
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:37,519
If you're smart, I'll share it with you.

2064
01:19:37,519 --> 01:19:39,519
That was the performance.

2065
01:19:40,519 --> 01:19:42,519
I'll have to say it now.

2066
01:19:42,519 --> 01:19:46,519
You have a lot of confidence in your abilities,

2067
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:48,519
in your car.

2068
01:19:48,519 --> 01:19:50,519
I just don't know how to drive it.

2069
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:51,519
Well, maybe.

2070
01:19:51,519 --> 01:19:53,519
I got a recording,

2071
01:19:53,519 --> 01:19:55,519
where you detect the lines,

2072
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:57,519
you fix it, and you drive it.

2073
01:19:57,519 --> 01:19:58,519
So...

2074
01:19:58,519 --> 01:19:59,519
It worked.

2075
01:19:59,519 --> 01:20:01,519
I still have it there as...

2076
01:20:01,519 --> 01:20:02,519
Jesus Christ.

2077
01:20:02,519 --> 01:20:03,519
But yeah.

2078
01:20:03,519 --> 01:20:04,519
Nope.

2079
01:20:06,519 --> 01:20:07,519
In the meantime,

2080
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:10,519
we could wrap up our conversation,

2081
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:12,519
because the fans are filming us,

2082
01:20:12,519 --> 01:20:15,519
and they're helping me with the lighting.

2083
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,519
Maybe the last topic would be...

2084
01:20:21,519 --> 01:20:23,519
Community.

2085
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:25,519
Or let's say...

2086
01:20:26,519 --> 01:20:28,519
GitHub, for example.

2087
01:20:29,519 --> 01:20:32,519
All these experiments,

2088
01:20:32,519 --> 01:20:34,519
all these codes,

2089
01:20:34,519 --> 01:20:36,519
production for the things you do,

2090
01:20:36,519 --> 01:20:38,519
you publish it.

2091
01:20:38,519 --> 01:20:40,519
And everything you publish

2092
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:42,519
is hosted on GitHub.

2093
01:20:42,519 --> 01:20:44,519
GitHub has become a community,

2094
01:20:44,519 --> 01:20:46,519
a hub.

2095
01:20:46,519 --> 01:20:49,519
What does GitHub represent to you?

2096
01:20:49,519 --> 01:20:52,519
Has it become the spot

2097
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:54,519
where you can hang out

2098
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:56,519
and talk to other developers?

2099
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:57,519
Or is it still you,

2100
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,519
just as a layout of the code?

2101
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:01,519
Maybe a bit of reputation building,

2102
01:21:01,519 --> 01:21:02,519
or something else.

2103
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:04,519
I used Stack Overflow here.

2104
01:21:05,519 --> 01:21:07,519
Isn't it a full pad?

2105
01:21:07,519 --> 01:21:08,519
GitHub or Stack Overflow?

2106
01:21:08,519 --> 01:21:09,519
Stack Overflow.

2107
01:21:09,519 --> 01:21:10,519
I mean, yeah, it's a full pad,

2108
01:21:10,519 --> 01:21:11,519
but if you want to call it

2109
01:21:11,519 --> 01:21:13,519
code reputation building,

2110
01:21:13,519 --> 01:21:15,519
whatever, it's different.

2111
01:21:15,519 --> 01:21:16,519
Reputation building.

2112
01:21:16,519 --> 01:21:17,519
I mean, you don't have

2113
01:21:17,519 --> 01:21:18,519
a chat on GitHub, right?

2114
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:20,519
You can see when someone starts, right?

2115
01:21:20,519 --> 01:21:22,519
Isn't there a chat on GitHub?

2116
01:21:22,519 --> 01:21:24,519
It's like a tweet, for example.

2117
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:26,519
I mean, people talk

2118
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:28,519
in pull requests and comments,

2119
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:30,519
but it's not a real-time collaboration,

2120
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:32,519
but it's a collaboration around work

2121
01:21:32,519 --> 01:21:34,519
for those who want to work.

2122
01:21:36,519 --> 01:21:38,519
If you want to work with someone,

2123
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:39,519
you'll look at their profile

2124
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:40,519
to see what they do,

2125
01:21:40,519 --> 01:21:42,519
but I don't know about that.

2126
01:21:42,519 --> 01:21:43,519
Let's say a person told you,

2127
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:44,519
for example,

2128
01:21:44,519 --> 01:21:45,519
now that you have badges and so on,

2129
01:21:45,519 --> 01:21:46,519
when they're a bit

2130
01:21:46,519 --> 01:21:48,519
gamification and so on.

2131
01:21:48,519 --> 01:21:49,519
For me, GitHub,

2132
01:21:49,519 --> 01:21:50,519
for example, in interviews,

2133
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:51,519
is quite important

2134
01:21:51,519 --> 01:21:53,519
if I see that something is there.

2135
01:21:53,519 --> 01:21:55,519
Then I can go and look,

2136
01:21:55,519 --> 01:21:56,519
okay,

2137
01:21:56,519 --> 01:21:57,519
you did this and that,

2138
01:21:57,519 --> 01:21:58,519
and this and that,

2139
01:21:58,519 --> 01:21:59,519
and you worked,

2140
01:21:59,519 --> 01:22:00,519
and I see how you communicated

2141
01:22:00,519 --> 01:22:02,519
with others.

2142
01:22:02,519 --> 01:22:03,519
Even if not,

2143
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:06,519
I actually have

2144
01:22:06,519 --> 01:22:08,519
excellent programmers in the team

2145
01:22:08,519 --> 01:22:10,519
who had GitHub empty

2146
01:22:10,519 --> 01:22:12,519
until then.

2147
01:22:13,519 --> 01:22:14,519
They had others.

2148
01:22:14,519 --> 01:22:15,519
Okay.

2149
01:22:16,519 --> 01:22:17,519
Good job.

2150
01:22:17,519 --> 01:22:19,519
Can I ask one last question?

2151
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:21,519
I'll give it to TNT.

2152
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:23,519
It could have been at the beginning,

2153
01:22:23,519 --> 01:22:24,519
but I...

2154
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:25,519
For all those

2155
01:22:25,519 --> 01:22:26,519
who have been waiting.

2156
01:22:26,519 --> 01:22:27,519
In the intro video,

2157
01:22:27,519 --> 01:22:28,519
I said something

2158
01:22:28,519 --> 01:22:29,519
that I didn't quite understand.

2159
01:22:29,519 --> 01:22:31,519
I said it like a geek.

2160
01:22:31,519 --> 01:22:32,519
Before that,

2161
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:33,519
I was in programming,

2162
01:22:33,519 --> 01:22:34,519
I was in electronics,

2163
01:22:34,519 --> 01:22:35,519
then I competed in robotics.

2164
01:22:35,519 --> 01:22:36,519
Before that,

2165
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:37,519
I was in electronics,

2166
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:38,519
I was in chemistry.

2167
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:39,519
And that was in primary school.

2168
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:42,519
Then we mixed explosives at home.

2169
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:43,519
I still have all the recipes,

2170
01:22:43,519 --> 01:22:44,519
if anyone needs them.

2171
01:22:44,519 --> 01:22:45,519
I can tell you.

2172
01:22:45,519 --> 01:22:46,519
Mainly,

2173
01:22:46,519 --> 01:22:48,519
my task was acetone peroxide,

2174
01:22:48,519 --> 01:22:50,519
which is very easy to make.

2175
01:22:50,519 --> 01:22:52,519
Acetone 3 peroxide

2176
01:22:52,519 --> 01:22:55,519
has 80% TNT power.

2177
01:22:55,519 --> 01:22:56,519
A very dangerous task.

2178
01:22:56,519 --> 01:22:58,519
You feel it

2179
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:01,519
when you look at it closely.

2180
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:02,519
The difference between

2181
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,519
TNT and acetone is

2182
01:23:03,519 --> 01:23:04,519
that you have to cool it.

2183
01:23:04,519 --> 01:23:05,519
It's easiest to do

2184
01:23:05,519 --> 01:23:07,519
in a family refrigerator.

2185
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:08,519
Because my mom

2186
01:23:08,519 --> 01:23:09,519
always locks the door

2187
01:23:09,519 --> 01:23:11,519
in front of the garden.

2188
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,519
She's always in front of the grave

2189
01:23:12,519 --> 01:23:13,519
with the refrigerator,

2190
01:23:13,519 --> 01:23:14,519
and so on.

2191
01:23:14,519 --> 01:23:15,519
And the whole refrigerator

2192
01:23:15,519 --> 01:23:17,519
smells of acetone.

2193
01:23:17,519 --> 01:23:18,519
Fun times.

2194
01:23:18,519 --> 01:23:19,519
When you started talking

2195
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:20,519
about these things,

2196
01:23:20,519 --> 01:23:21,519
we were watching it

2197
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:22,519
with our neighbors.

2198
01:23:22,519 --> 01:23:23,519
Then we left

2199
01:23:23,519 --> 01:23:24,519
when one of my colleagues

2200
01:23:24,519 --> 01:23:26,519
took three fingers away.

2201
01:23:26,519 --> 01:23:29,519
We left at that time.

2202
01:23:29,519 --> 01:23:30,519
I'm looking if anyone is interested.

2203
01:23:30,519 --> 01:23:32,520
I like to talk about all this.

2204
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,520
I mean, not specifically

2205
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,520
about the day

2206
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,520
when you lose a finger,

2207
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,520
but that's a long story short again.

2208
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,520
As the saying goes,

2209
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,520
BOMBS AWAY!

2210
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,520
BOMBS AWAY!

2211
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,520
As the saying goes,

2212
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,520
I'm going to drink a beer.

2213
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,520
So at this moment,

2214
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,520
I would like to thank

2215
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,520
the whole team in Grodno

2216
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,520
for their hard work and sacrifice.

2217
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520
Thank you for supporting us

2218
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,520
as much as you should.

2219
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,520
And a special thank you

2220
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,520
to Jan and Ino

2221
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,520
for this conversation and chat.

2222
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,520
We will talk a little bit with you.

2223
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,520
Share this video,

2224
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:11,520
subscribe,

2225
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,520
and if you have any feedback,

2226
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,520
we will be very happy

2227
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,520
if you give it to us.

2228
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,520
I also like to talk

2229
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,520
with people in general.

2230
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,520
If anyone is interested,

2231
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,520
we can go out for a beer

2232
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,520
or whatever.

2233
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,520
Thank you for watching.

2234
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,520
Thank you for the call.

2235
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,520
Thank you.
