1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
Well, everybody, welcome to our show.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,120
Welcome to Ogrodje, which should be translated to a framework in English.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,840
Welcome to our very first episode that we're going to try to do in English today.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,360
This is something that we want to experiment with, because so far we were all Slovenian

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,000
podcast.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And primarily, when we were preparing for this talk show, we waited for a while to get

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,119
a speaker that would kind of like transcend our local space and who would be fluent in

8
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,119
English.

9
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,119
And luckily we found such a guest.

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,119
The wrong one.

11
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,119
The wrong one.

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:01:01,480
But we'll discuss that why you're the wrong one, but equally, like if our English is so

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:09,760
bad and we need a fallback, you're also fluent in Slovenian, so we can go.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,440
We can also fall back with that.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,959
You took some Slovenian courses, right?

16
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,959
Yes.

17
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,680
So see, you can do bilingual.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,680
You can say at least hello to everybody.

19
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,040
Yeah, here we go.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,559
And what else should we say?

21
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:33,720
You forgot to mention that this episode is part of the borderless.

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,440
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,160
We should definitely tell people that.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,559
So we're going to prefix all the content that's in English with borderless tag or name, which

25
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:49,919
should hint that we are transcending our borders of our little country, trying to, again, speak

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,879
to international guests.

27
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,720
That's the intro for today.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,400
We're going to talk about security, a lot of things around security, but still we'll

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,839
try to be more aware about security that's related to developers, I guess, which is your

30
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,080
specialty.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,479
And you're going to be the host today, right?

32
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,479
I'll try.

33
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,399
I'll try.

34
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:32,759
So yeah, this episode, in a way, it's an honor to have you here, Petra, to sort of

35
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,080
do the connection, how and why.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,000
We met, what, it was the first B-Sides, and I think you were one of the first submissions,

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,160
you submitted to the call for papers for B-Sides, and I was sort of cheering.

38
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,399
Come on, we have somebody from Australia that's willing to speak at B-Sides.

39
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,679
How come?

40
00:02:55,679 --> 00:03:02,440
And the funny thing is, like, it's sort of what we joke about.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,679
You mentioned that, like, for that request, you said you want to see Kremschnitta.

42
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:13,039
And I was like, there's an Australian guy who wants Kremschnitta also there.

43
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,740
So yeah, long story short.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:23,539
So you're married to Slovene, living in Australia, you're working in security industry, so information

45
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,539
security.

46
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,979
Maybe a good question.

47
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,179
What's sexier, cyber security or information security?

48
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,179
What do you prefer?

49
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,559
I'll go with the former.

50
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,220
So information security.

51
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,580
So we're like skipping the cyber security.

52
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,580
Cool.

53
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
So...

54
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Or whatever.

55
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,139
You're trying to find the word.

56
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:54,619
You're now sort of a regular guest on a yearly basis coming here.

57
00:03:54,619 --> 00:04:01,339
And sort of, in a way, I could basically call you a friend.

58
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:11,059
Like this friendship, whenever you're around, well, you, in a way, also, like, helping the

59
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,619
local security community here.

60
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:24,420
So, and for example, like yesterday, you had a great sort of a workshop on Python meetup.

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:33,619
So that's why, like, you're working with developers or like this knowledge.

62
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:40,299
So in cyber security.

63
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:41,299
You got me there.

64
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,299
You got me there.

65
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:46,540
He did a poll on Twitter and he's still, and I think it was 50-50 or something.

66
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Yeah.

67
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
It was 50-50.

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,540
It depends.

69
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
We lost the bat.

70
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Let's just use what...

71
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Depends who you ask.

72
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:59,179
And if you ask chatGTPA, you have like, it's always referring to cyber security.

73
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:03,880
So it seems that the buzzword, but okay, we'll stick to information security.

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,839
So like this short introduction, who are you?

75
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:18,679
Like it's sort of like, because in a way, in the intro, we said like, we're going to

76
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,679
host a great hacker.

77
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:25,000
So are you feeling like this title should suit you?

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,279
Like you feel like you...

79
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,279
I mean, hacker has different meanings, right?

80
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,799
Someone who changed something.

81
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,799
It depends.

82
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,160
Or someone to break into things, right?

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,720
Or like explore or like wanting to learn, wanting to figure out how things are working.

84
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,640
I think definitely curiosity is part of it, right?

85
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,480
And hacker, I don't know, just kind of, I feel that curiosity more represent the person

86
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,920
who like is into security because kind of you, you want to use the functionality for

87
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,799
the purposes that the engineer who built that or the team that have built that maybe never

88
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:06,600
thought about it or finding that beautiful edge case that can make this program do something

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
differently.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,079
Now, obviously, if it impacts people's life or businesses, that become a security issue.

91
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,600
But I think that sense of curiosity, I would say, yeah.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:28,720
One of the biggest critiques of our podcast is that our guests, our listeners sometimes

93
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,959
need to Google our guests to find out who they are.

94
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,720
So formally, my understanding is that you have a PhD in security and you taught at the

95
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
university in Australia.

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm not sure if you still teach, but you teach...

97
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
What did you teach or like?

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,760
Can you tell us a bit more about it?

99
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,320
So, I mean, the hardest thing for me is bio, right?

100
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Yeah.

101
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:02,200
So currently, I'm a lecturer at a university in Down Under.

102
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:09,679
And well, I teach a master course in, well, I should say cybersecurity related as a technical

103
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,920
course.

104
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:19,420
But apart from that, I also teach to general developers out there in terms of secure programming.

105
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,359
This was just a transition I had.

106
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:31,040
I was more, as you know, more on the other side of the game, looking at how do we find

107
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
bugs?

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
How we can find better bugs?

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:43,079
And bugs, sorry, well, it's a dev podcast, so I shouldn't say vulnerabilities or issues.

110
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,239
So yeah.

111
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:51,000
And then kind of, it was a natural transition.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:02,720
So let's maybe start in the beginning, how you sort of study this or how you start in

113
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
information security?

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,279
What made you like this?

115
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:14,239
Because you definitely did a transition from offensive security to now defensive security

116
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:23,239
and like teaching developers how to do like secure coding or best practicing in terms

117
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:32,679
of applying security, best practicing in development, but still.

118
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,039
So I mean, the funny thing is, I always say there is no book for security as you have

119
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,239
a book for PHP and Python and Java, just open it up and you finish it.

120
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,880
You're kind of advanced security guy.

121
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,239
And I think that's the beauty part of it.

122
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,799
I think, again, I want to go back to the sense of security.

123
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,000
How is this started?

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,520
Well, someone tried to hack me back in the days.

125
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,919
They tried to, well, we had this newsletter and for some reason that newsletter got popular

126
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:11,679
and this person had the interest or two people to, well, get some admin access on that newsletter.

127
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:19,159
And well, they were, I would say talented enough that they built their own backdoor

128
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:26,520
or Trojan file and they sent it to me and they were asking me, okay, to execute that.

129
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,960
Via mail.

130
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,719
I did execute it.

131
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,359
So spear phishing.

132
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,359
Yeah.

133
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:38,599
Because they were part of like, well, that community themself, like, okay.

134
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:43,880
And I'm like, I'm executing this, but it doesn't work.

135
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,239
And after, and then the other guy on the other side of it, there was a chat happening and

136
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:52,159
he tried with this command, this parameter and none of them works.

137
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,159
And then he keeps asking me to try this and that.

138
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,719
After some point, I just felt there's something fishy going on.

139
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:07,520
And then after a while, the guy actually gave me a call over the phone, like, hey, are you

140
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,960
sure you're running that?

141
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,599
I'm like, yeah.

142
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:14,960
But then he said, okay, but have you tried this?

143
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Yeah.

144
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Hmm.

145
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,039
And then the guys, I started asking, uh, but, uh, are you, I'm kind of not sure whether

146
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,080
you're telling me through the guy is telling me, like, why is that?

147
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,080
It's like, oh, because do you know what that file is?

148
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,479
And then I kind of got some idea like, yes, I know, I have no idea what it is.

149
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,840
And then he's kind of like, you are a good hacker.

150
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,159
Like, what is, what does that even mean?

151
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,960
I didn't even say anything.

152
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,479
So long story short, the reason that thing didn't work was not because the program was

153
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:54,520
failing was because I was using a university internet and they had proxy and the proxy

154
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
was blocking all the traffic.

155
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Oh, okay.

156
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,840
And like I thought, I know it, I kind of pretend that I'm executing that file, but I was actually

157
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
not doing it.

158
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,059
He was, he was thinking that way.

159
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:14,380
That kind of got me kind of like, did he like, why would you run malicious software?

160
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:22,179
So we were talking, yeah, days off when we even didn't call it malware, we was talking

161
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,900
about viruses and AVs.

162
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Okay.

163
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Okay.

164
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
So very early days.

165
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:33,340
Yeah, kind of early dial up internet and the old internet connections, which, you know,

166
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,500
you could be at programs called Trojans, you know, I don't know, some of you will remember

167
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,099
sub seven or things like that.

168
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:45,260
You could connect remotely, do stuff, but kind of, that kind of opens up the idea of

169
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,619
the, Hey, there is something more to what you see when you run a program or when you

170
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:54,500
connect to a network.

171
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,820
And then, yeah, there was no resources.

172
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:05,179
There was effectively a couple of like CD-ROM, like CD discs that had some hacking tools

173
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,520
on them.

174
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,900
And then you had some text files from, oh yeah, there was a magazine called Frack magazine,

175
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,820
which exists today.

176
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,539
You want to explain what Frack magazine is to young audience?

177
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:34,219
So back in the early days, that was like, it was like monthly, monthly.

178
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:41,140
And then when it got like older, it became annually.

179
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,099
But concept was like from like PBSs.

180
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:49,299
So when like people were interesting in-

181
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:52,500
This was online or you had to order via mail or something?

182
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:01,580
They were like also later on the printed copies, but usually the PBSs had like, and they were

183
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:15,340
like short TXT files with a good description of sort of exploiting or like getting familiar

184
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,460
with, I don't know, technology or concept.

185
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:26,299
And I'm like from programming or how to, I don't know, program some special computers

186
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:34,780
or how the, I don't know, the ATM networks work or how the ISPs communicate.

187
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:45,099
Like they were like, in a way, resourceful manuals, how to get know about some technologies.

188
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,059
So these were like snippets without long explanations?

189
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:52,780
It got into real details.

190
00:13:52,780 --> 00:14:01,340
So they were like, basically back then, the really good sources where you like understand

191
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,460
how like new technology works.

192
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
Yeah.

193
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Pretty technical.

194
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,340
I think one section which I liked the most was phone hacking.

195
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:14,219
Because we had a really high bill for our internet connection because I was looking

196
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,580
for a way that, hey, can we switch to maybe neighbors?

197
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Yeah.

198
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,179
And those freaking, freaking was like very, very popular.

199
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:26,179
And like basically everything grew out of that kind of community.

200
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,179
Yeah.

201
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:35,020
But there's a big gap between, you know, 2023 and the dial-up, what did you do in between

202
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
as well?

203
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,539
I mean, that's kind of interest growed in, right?

204
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:45,179
And then I think, then we are talking about the days that, you know, web apps start to

205
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,099
emerge in CGI bin folders and there's lots of interesting things there.

206
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,179
And then PHP become a thing, right?

207
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:58,900
And you could almost touch every website and there is like XSS and SQL injection there.

208
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,940
And because they are starting to evolve, we are talking about very early version of MySQL.

209
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:14,780
And again, it was more like understanding how, I think the way I end up finding some,

210
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,140
actually I have some CVs, goes back to 2005.

211
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,820
You kind of, I actually learned it from a programming way, like I actually learned how

212
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,859
you can build a web app.

213
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:30,179
And then how you can communicate the database.

214
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,559
Then when someone said, hey, you know, we have this variable here or PHP just gets everything

215
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,479
in the request and dump it in a query.

216
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,119
Well, ah, okay.

217
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:43,400
So I know that kind of what kind of query will make what, it was not just like, just

218
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,119
go there, put a typical Wikipedia example of a SQL injection.

219
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,119
One equals to one.

220
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:51,599
It was more like you could think a little bit more further than that.

221
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,599
Okay.

222
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,599
This query does that.

223
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,140
So one equals one will not work, but this other one will work.

224
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,039
So I kind of, it was almost more like a, and I should say there were like forums, like

225
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,200
discussion boards of really, um, enthusiasts that they really want to help, like want to

226
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,799
like help you when you are trying to find an issue or kind of, you are really close

227
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,239
to exploitation.

228
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,679
You could ask question and they will just answer it.

229
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:26,159
I think that kind of engraved in me that this is like really also nice that you also share

230
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,159
this knowledge.

231
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,679
And I think from beginning was this idea of ethics was always there.

232
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:41,200
I think it's kind of, kind of, it was not cool that you find this issue and not telling

233
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,559
vendor about it.

234
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,719
But at the time, you know, we are not talking about, you know, these days, majority of the

235
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:53,280
good businesses, they have these, well, they, they understand there could be a time someone

236
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,640
report a security issue to them.

237
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,840
And there's normally, there is a unwritten rule of responsible disclosure policy.

238
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:07,119
But back in, back in those days, maybe it wasn't, it was not that clear.

239
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,479
And normally when you report a security bug, often you want some attribution back.

240
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:16,959
I remember when we were reporting some security bugs to some vendors, we were like, okay,

241
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,640
the only thing we want from you is just mention my name in your next newsletter.

242
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I'll go there.

243
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
I'll do it.

244
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Yeah.

245
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Yeah.

246
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Okay.

247
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Okay.

248
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
And you, you started as a, as a, I don't know, researcher or somebody who was like, uh,

249
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,680
chasing, chasing those, those back, exploring on their own or how, how you like?

250
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,599
Uh, well, I mean, it actually started first by like building networks.

251
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,359
I remember like the first thing you do, you know, when I bring up a Windows NT and you

252
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,599
know, set up a network and then you move to Linux, you're like, huh, it's not that easy

253
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,640
even just bringing up a DHCP server needs that much config file.

254
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,079
And there is no sample file out there, like just Google for it, you know, you need to

255
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,560
figure out what each configuration does.

256
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,520
I think they started there, like learning really the, the foundations, learning really

257
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:11,959
what's how things work from physical layer all the way up to application layer.

258
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:18,560
And kind of that's, that's how I feel is, and the more you know about how things work,

259
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,280
the more you can kind of challenge these, these assumptions we have to between different

260
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,079
layers, which I always mention it, like the more, you know, how things will translate

261
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:35,199
into, well, in a different layer of the network, the more you can find that, okay.

262
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:40,160
Like if this thing doesn't have this specific format, well, guess what?

263
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,560
It could result into a security bot.

264
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,479
I think, I don't think there's any shortcut there to know it.

265
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:57,079
So this is like, basically through this learning experience, exploring like new technology,

266
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:04,239
like you mentioned Linux and so on, you basically reach, like migrate to, to, to information

267
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:13,280
security and like getting all, all that knowledge gives, gave you the, the foundations on, on,

268
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
on top.

269
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,160
You could like, I don't know, have a career in, in, in information security.

270
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,199
Yeah, exactly.

271
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:29,400
I actually, when I, when I was, when I graduated from my, my doctoral degree, I actually didn't

272
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,920
know there is even a job exists that they pay you to find security bugs.

273
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,680
Like I didn't even know there is such a thing even exists because always it was a hobby.

274
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,160
It was always the sysadmin type guy that maybe care about what, how long the password

275
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
should be.

276
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,800
And then maybe put some restriction there or to harden their SSH endpoint.

277
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,199
It wasn't really a thing that you could feel, well, someone really would be interested that

278
00:19:57,199 --> 00:20:02,719
you go and ethically review their system and they will pay for it.

279
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:08,040
I remember I was actually looking for more like a research engineering type positions.

280
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,959
I actually came across all of a sudden with this position that talks about, are you familiar

281
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,920
with your application security issues?

282
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,800
Do you have any experience finding security was on the wall?

283
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:27,040
It seems like interesting and yeah, and, and working there as a effectively as a consultant,

284
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,239
a penetration tester.

285
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:35,160
And that's, yeah, getting familiar with the whole story of, you know, yeah, okay, nowadays

286
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,000
you need to do vulnerability scan.

287
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,839
Then you, you report that to your customer, you need to explain, explain that and yada,

288
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,839
yada, yada.

289
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,839
Started there.

290
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,839
Yeah.

291
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:53,680
But like with, with like in, in, in this process, like you could, we could already say that

292
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,959
you're a veteran in, in, in, in the field.

293
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:07,000
And like you said, the, the basically jobs in information security back then were like

294
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,719
not known or like not like wanted that, that much.

295
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:21,760
But now like you have kids finishing college that specialized in, in, in security.

296
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,520
And like you have this new generation of, of, of, of people already very eager to,

297
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,400
to work in, in, in information security field.

298
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:40,319
And maybe you can like share like how you see this new generation of, of, of, you know,

299
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,880
I don't not necessarily agree with the, whether the colleagues, colleges, or even universities

300
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,920
produce skilled people, but definitely eagerness, not eagerness was there also back then.

301
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,079
Yeah.

302
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:58,319
Like maybe it was not in a sense of web application hacking or, or cloud hacking, but it was also,

303
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,359
if you remember, we had the whole area of cracking, cracking files, cracking games and

304
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,359
all these things.

305
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,640
And the whole concept of reverse engineering a game to figure out how it works, or you

306
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,479
can just, you know, it's, I remember we were trying to crack the, there was old Prince

307
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:20,439
of Persia type game, or how can I jump to last level?

308
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:25,920
And that was my exposure to Hex editor and the things that, Oh, things behind the scene

309
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
looks like Hex.

310
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,880
And I thought actually Hex is what machine will understand.

311
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,040
And then I realized, no, actually, no, there is something more layer behind it.

312
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,160
It was more, more those things.

313
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,400
So even those days, there were people who were looking to do this thing, viruses and

314
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,920
things were, was the area that a lot of people wanted to figure, figure things out.

315
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,560
You know, that there are things can go wrong with the system, but, and I don't necessarily

316
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,479
know if there was any college degree, you know, doing it, but okay, coming back to what

317
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,479
was the question?

318
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,479
They were the new generation.

319
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,479
Yeah.

320
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,479
The new generation.

321
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:11,000
So basically you, from your transition on how you like ended up in, in, in, in this

322
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,239
field or gain this kind of expertise, we can like definitely see the new generation,

323
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:25,319
like in a way it's sexy to work in information security or, or work as a, as a penetration

324
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,839
tester or a security researcher.

325
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:35,680
But from, from my perspective, what I see is like this, this young generation or people

326
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:43,599
not having enough knowledge, fundamental knowledge of understanding, I don't know how a TCP API

327
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,479
networking works or understanding how operation system works.

328
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:52,959
And, and they just want to like do the sexy stuff in terms of, of hacking and breaking

329
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:59,880
stuff, but not really understanding what are they like breaking and what is like the layers

330
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,000
below running and why things are working that way.

331
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,719
The things that takes time, the things that you need to spend more time on.

332
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:08,359
But I'm going to challenge you guys now.

333
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:15,479
So this could turn into like old people nagging, nagging about the younger generation, right?

334
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:22,800
But what if, what if, um, the, the layers that you guys mentioned so far have been around

335
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:31,880
so long that they're so mature and so, so protected and so, you know, all the bugs have

336
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,319
been found and they're so stable that those layers are not with flaws.

337
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,520
So today they're coming from very different angle.

338
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,839
They are, they're approaching from top down, right?

339
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,760
So perhaps then in that case, you need a different kind of skills, which is a good news to hear,

340
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
right?

341
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,560
So that was, we haven't based our time, just still fixing the IP port, well, having said

342
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,599
that there was just a vulnerability identified in.

343
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,320
in implementation of one of the Linux distro just recently.

344
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,160
Ping.

345
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,800
Ping ICMP protocol right now, 2023, right?

346
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,360
So it's not that all these layers are so very secure.

347
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,160
I mean, you shouldn't ask me for that.

348
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,320
But definitely there has been a huge improvement, right?

349
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,799
In all those layers, right?

350
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,040
And kind of you assume that, you know,

351
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,600
one of the best things, for example,

352
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
like these days you always assume the traffic

353
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,599
that comes from your browser to your API is secure.

354
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,799
It's on a secure channel.

355
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,160
You never think twice, but you go back some years ago,

356
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,480
that was not the case.

357
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,279
Actually, some of the findings that you may find

358
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,000
in the Pentest report was always about SSL.

359
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh, you're not using this certificate.

360
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,360
But kind of, sort of, maybe,

361
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,240
I don't want to give a percentage,

362
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,560
but that is kind of gone, which you're happy.

363
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
So kind of, we don't really need to report

364
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,720
on those sort of things.

365
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,439
We have definitely improvement

366
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,519
on some front-end frameworks, right?

367
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,000
Like some of the security issues

368
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,320
are really hard to get introduced,

369
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
which again, we're glad to see that.

370
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,559
So it's kind of by default,

371
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,160
some of these frameworks enforce some security controls

372
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,959
that if you really want to do something very bad,

373
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,919
there's like a function you can,

374
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,879
they don't limit you,

375
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,599
but the function is called dangerously something.

376
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,440
Yeah.

377
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,000
Something kind of gives you a hint.

378
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,959
You're doing something very fishy.

379
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,360
Which is great, but back in the days,

380
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,639
well, in JavaScript, you have eval.

381
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,120
Is eval dangerous or not?

382
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,959
Yeah.

383
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,120
I think eval should be renamed to something.

384
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,519
Don't call this function ever parameter.

385
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,239
So definitely was an improvement.

386
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,199
But again, coming back to that,

387
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:52,360
I feel those foundations are necessary.

388
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,599
If you don't know how say computer works,

389
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,400
what processes, how,

390
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,720
and then you want to quickly jump in,

391
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
like let's say, learning about Docker security,

392
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
container security,

393
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,519
but behind the scene is a process.

394
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,919
Behind the scene is a C group.

395
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,639
Behind the scene is a name space, right?

396
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:12,360
It's nothing different,

397
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,039
but without that foundation of like, let's say,

398
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm not saying you need to know the Linux kernel,

399
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,240
but without that foundation that what are these are,

400
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,360
just jumping in,

401
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,960
running in a scanner,

402
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,800
trying to find a security bug in a container,

403
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,039
not gonna take you far.

404
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,600
If you want to be a thinker in this area,

405
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,199
perhaps one of the really good quotes

406
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,679
I can mention here from one professor in Australia,

407
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,080
he said that in our industry,

408
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
we have so many technicians in security,

409
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,720
we just need more engineers,

410
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,839
like people who can come and think.

411
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,679
And to be, I feel to be that engineer,

412
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,600
you really need to understand how things work.

413
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,839
What is like, in your view,

414
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,160
like a big difference between, I don't know,

415
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,479
I will use the term hacker here,

416
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,440
but what's the big difference between a hacker

417
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,679
and senior software engineer?

418
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,160
Is there even a big difference?

419
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,759
And in what way can you like elaborate on this a bit?

420
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,160
So I find like engineers in general

421
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,559
more have this builder mindset.

422
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,880
The mindset of getting things working,

423
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,679
getting things efficient,

424
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,759
getting, get the, you know,

425
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,800
solve that defined problem.

426
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,440
But like someone who is on,

427
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,279
let's say in a hacker or security side

428
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,600
is more like a breaker mindset.

429
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,199
I don't know, I often make this example,

430
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,199
like to build a bridge,

431
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,240
it takes some skillset,

432
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,919
but to blow up that bridge in a controlled manner,

433
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,800
so it doesn't touch the buildings around,

434
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,639
that is different set of skillset.

435
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:50,320
Whereas the original builder may not necessarily have it.

436
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:54,399
I actually found this through the workshops that I ran,

437
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,360
that the person,

438
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,399
or some of students I had back in the days

439
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,600
that you find a super talented guy,

440
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,119
he seems to really good in programming,

441
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,479
you know, he doesn't even need any direction.

442
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,520
But I really think,

443
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,199
oh, that person should be great for, you know,

444
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,799
thinking about all these edge cases that,

445
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,720
rare cases that can happen to a software

446
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,040
that can result into a security issue,

447
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,079
but he's just not interested.

448
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,760
They're like, they don't find it attractive.

449
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,119
They don't find it cool.

450
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,359
They actually like to build things.

451
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,200
Yeah.

452
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,399
And it's, that makes sense.

453
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,519
And like, before jumping to the next section,

454
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,279
in this process, like in the beginning you said,

455
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,480
and that's also my experience,

456
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,480
like this InfoSec community worldwide is pretty open.

457
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,279
It's pretty like this knowledge sharing is always there.

458
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,959
Like in a way, like the open source community,

459
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:04,040
but even more like the way I see it,

460
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,440
even more,

461
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,359
friendly in a way.

462
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,359
And you're also the father of SecTalks.

463
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
You're the founder, right?

464
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,640
Father, father, founder, father figure.

465
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,320
And maybe you should like explain,

466
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,480
because basically you build sort of a community in,

467
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,920
let's call it your backyard and then like outgrow

468
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,399
the community, right?

469
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:32,239
Yeah.

470
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,640
Let's call it your backyard and then like outgrow

471
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,000
this community to copy paste it in different,

472
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,279
around Australia and abroad.

473
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,799
What is SecTalks about?

474
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,720
I think it has started with the whole thing that

475
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
you like to visit like-minded people in the industry.

476
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,359
And, you know, security,

477
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,079
although maybe it's a big topic now,

478
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,239
it doesn't have, I don't feel it even have

479
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,279
such a large community of people comparing with perhaps

480
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,519
software development community to some extent.

481
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,200
So it was always good to just, you know,

482
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,399
sit around and just given the nature of security,

483
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:15,880
there are things that people may not necessarily

484
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,480
talk about it online,

485
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,839
but maybe in a setting, you know,

486
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,880
in some venue,

487
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,799
they may actually talk about it and you may hear

488
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,959
very interesting stories.

489
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:31,239
So I think, again, that was, again, a natural thing.

490
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,279
You kind of feel, oh, I actually like to visit.

491
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,320
At the time I was in Perth, in Western Australia,

492
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,600
there were some ad hoc events happening there.

493
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,279
And after a while, one of those events that we had,

494
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,559
that like was running for every month,

495
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,200
it suddenly stopped.

496
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,279
And then we just felt this void of, oh, actually,

497
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,720
you know, I want to really meet someone.

498
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,079
And then I was also working for a security consulting

499
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,000
business at the time.

500
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
And then I was like, hey, what if, you know,

501
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,959
we just try to run it here, ask around,

502
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,559
and that primarily started.

503
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,559
But the things I think we started from beginning,

504
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,119
I tried to advocate it was this whole idea

505
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,559
of the no bullshit.

506
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,559
Like, you know, you come here more than welcome.

507
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,799
We would love to talk to you.

508
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,079
You can even give a talk, but keep the bullshit.

509
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,920
But this is sort of like, I would say,

510
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,920
we, the security people, we really don't want to hear

511
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,880
and see bullshit.

512
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,799
Because basically each security community,

513
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,799
or it's like this kind of local community going on,

514
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,600
like.

515
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,399
But like, can we be a bit more specific?

516
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,559
What do you mean, bullshit?

517
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,519
You mean you don't want to hear, I don't know,

518
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,519
marketing pitches, like, you want to talk about,

519
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,239
I don't know, exploits, vulnerabilities,

520
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,440
how to protect your systems from it.

521
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,399
You want to have, you know, first raw access

522
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,399
to this kind of data.

523
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,160
Yeah, but to be hardcore technical.

524
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,880
To not like presenting the upper layer,

525
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,519
how this, what you built or what you're going to present

526
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,320
is off, is great and so on,

527
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,239
without discussing what is running above.

528
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,359
Yeah, exactly.

529
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,359
It's just, I think you look at when you're long enough

530
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,960
in security, you know, things are not secure.

531
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,559
Yeah.

532
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,679
And that's the reality of it.

533
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:57,640
You can't really say, yeah, even claim.

534
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
And we have, there are interesting stories

535
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,080
that CEO is going out and claiming such and such

536
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,559
database engine is secure.

537
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,679
And then there is a book is now written for that,

538
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,719
how to hack that database engine out there.

539
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,799
So you kind of, you see these things

540
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,039
and also as a, like a geek or a technical guy,

541
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,400
you know how things work and you know, okay,

542
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,159
under these condition and that certain assumptions,

543
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,559
yeah, maybe that thing is secure, but in reality it's not.

544
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,960
And you don't want to go somewhere,

545
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,640
just hear someone talking about that.

546
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,159
It's kind of want to attract those people

547
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,400
who have a genuine interest in the field,

548
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,640
not necessarily are opportunistic that they think,

549
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,119
well, I would say perhaps the time

550
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,799
that this whole thing started was not so much a big topic,

551
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:43,320
was more like, well, you just get together, have a chat.

552
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,599
So kind of trying to attract those, more those guys.

553
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,960
And the other thing I felt was important

554
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,840
is that this egoistic nature of,

555
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,719
when you feel you're a hacker or a security guy,

556
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,200
you feel you're so special that,

557
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,719
because, you know, you find something

558
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,119
that perhaps nobody in that team would ever discover it.

559
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,599
I kind of, you have this feeling of, okay, all right.

560
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,200
So, you know, I'm very important.

561
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,919
What kind of, I actually didn't like it either.

562
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,239
I'm like, if you are a great hacker,

563
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,320
you actually need, can you explain it to someone

564
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,080
who doesn't have any clue?

565
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,919
Well, then that means you're a really good hacker.

566
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,760
I can sit here and talk about the, everything is broken.

567
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,719
This wifi is broken and that network is broken,

568
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,119
but that doesn't.

569
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,520
It's not useful inside.

570
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,039
We know that it's already broken.

571
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:40,880
Yeah.

572
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,719
Yeah. Okay.

573
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,559
Just come and talk about it.

574
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,880
Yeah.

575
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,719
Okay.

576
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,200
And in like.

577
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,039
May I ask this question?

578
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:47,880
Yeah, sure.

579
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,840
You come up as a really humble in this conversation,

580
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,359
but there's a Sektalks around the world.

581
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,359
There's around 10,000 members in this community

582
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,679
or something like that.

583
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,119
So in all major cities, these Sektalk events appear

584
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,960
on a monthly basis, if I understand correctly.

585
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,159
So audience out there, if you're interested,

586
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,679
make sure you find it out.

587
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,520
We'll put some links there.

588
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,119
Right?

589
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,799
Can I do that?

590
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:16,799
Yeah, but it's interesting

591
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,479
because this is one of those meetups

592
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,559
that it's not recorded, if I understand correctly.

593
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,559
Yeah, but there were some recorded meetups during COVID.

594
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,400
Then.

595
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,239
And in general, it's true.

596
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,840
Generally, yeah, in person.

597
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
You know, you want to meet people in 3D.

598
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,719
You know, you don't want.

599
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,280
And like, to some extent,

600
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,280
like those meetups also include capture the flag?

601
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,679
Maybe.

602
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,520
Yeah, so.

603
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,039
Maybe it's like for the audience to explain what this is.

604
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,919
So you know, Perth is a city in Australia,

605
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,719
which I mean, 1.4 million,

606
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,000
but it may fill that audit.

607
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,200
So there's a lot of people there,

608
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,679
but at the time, any of you who are a meetup organizer,

609
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,159
you know that it's really hard to find good content.

610
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,400
So the idea, and yeah, we play a game in security,

611
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,159
which I always advocate to anyone who wants

612
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,760
to start security to do it is capture the flag,

613
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,960
which the goal is, you know,

614
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,960
you hack into this simulated or virtual environment

615
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,479
to find a flag.

616
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,440
And a lot of people naturally has interest in that.

617
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,880
But one of the things you,

618
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,039
I mean, I often found was missing is that, you know,

619
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:29,000
these CTFs typically run as part of a conference

620
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,960
and you have lead hackers.

621
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,239
You know, they go and break things

622
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,479
and find the flags and get the trophy,

623
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:39,119
but you don't really hear that how they have done it,

624
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,159
like how they have achieved it,

625
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,640
which I felt that was a knowledge missing.

626
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,919
But guess what?

627
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:47,239
It was like one stone, two birds.

628
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,400
I was like, okay, how about we run a CTF,

629
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,440
we limit it only to 60 minutes.

630
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,520
And then let the people doing it on the day.

631
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,239
And then in the next session,

632
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,440
because it's very hard to find a good speaker,

633
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:05,239
the person who hacked it can come and talk about it.

634
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,080
And the kind of,

635
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,479
we kind of have this filler of the events happening.

636
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,719
That worked well for,

637
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,280
especially for the smaller communities we had.

638
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,880
So it's like a good, good starter.

639
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,080
And hopefully we don't end up, you know,

640
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,200
getting any vendor talks and things to do, it's crippling.

641
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,200
But do you think like nowadays the Capture the Flag contest

642
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,919
or like online hack in the boxes

643
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,919
became more popular than like, I don't know,

644
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,799
10 years ago, 15 years ago?

645
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:33,640
Yeah, definitely.

646
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,960
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

647
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,520
It's not, my understanding is that

648
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,760
if this used to be like part of the conferences

649
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
organized to challenge people,

650
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,840
now it's becoming very competitive

651
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,960
and really big thing across the globe.

652
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,599
People are really learning

653
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,359
and preparing just for these things.

654
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,119
So as we discussed earlier,

655
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,599
we said that you need to learn these layers

656
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,200
to build your stack and learn, you know, all the things.

657
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,559
People are now optimizing for just these games,

658
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,919
if I understand correctly, right?

659
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:07,840
So they probably learn all the tricks

660
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,960
that are possible in these timeframes

661
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,320
or is there like elements

662
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,960
that you need to reinvent some new mechanics or?

663
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,919
Yeah, the way I saw like the good teams,

664
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,440
like they have their own tooling.

665
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,880
They prepared like how to like,

666
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:28,400
had some advantage on how to compete.

667
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,159
Prior to coming to these challenges.

668
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,320
Yeah, yeah.

669
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,320
And a lot of actually, some of the good hacking tooling

670
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,080
or security testing tooling actually came out

671
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,960
of some of these CTFs,

672
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,719
specifically one quite interesting security issue,

673
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,599
which is known as Severed Site Template Injection or SSTI.

674
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,640
This bug was the demonstration of how bad this bug can get

675
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,599
or how this vulnerability can get so bad

676
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,760
was through one of the, some of the CTFs

677
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,799
and the write up one of these players had

678
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:08,840
and the kind of that expanded that,

679
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,679
whoa, this thing can go really seriously bad.

680
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,159
So, and then yeah, publishing those tools

681
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,880
and as Andrei said, some of them actually

682
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,679
have the Python libraries even for

683
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:23,280
how to do different things so quickly.

684
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,719
It's a competition.

685
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,960
Can you give us a bit more example

686
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
what's in this toolbox that they use?

687
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:38,799
I mean, let me rephrase the question.

688
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,400
Can you give us example of these challenges?

689
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,080
Like what would be, for example, examples

690
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,039
a good assignment that will be part

691
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,400
of a capture the flag challenge?

692
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,359
Well, those are like the default ones of stenography,

693
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:57,840
like hiding the flag inside some kind of image.

694
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Then like very known are like also the PCAP.

695
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,599
So snapshot of network traffic and then inside like that,

696
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,520
there's a flag.

697
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,479
What else?

698
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:16,320
I mean, reverse engineering.

699
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,960
So you have the binary file and you need to figure out

700
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,359
what does that do?

701
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:23,840
I mean, you have a web application type security issues

702
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,119
that the goal is to hack into that web app

703
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,239
or web API and then exploit it.

704
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,960
And eventually you get perhaps a root access there

705
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,840
and you can read the text file, which is a flag there.

706
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,799
It's very-

707
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:42,400
Are these things like chained together

708
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,080
or is this like hacking to this webpage,

709
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,919
get the flag and then move to the next challenge?

710
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,760
Or do you have to like, do you change them together?

711
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Like get one flag here and then do something else

712
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,960
or is this, it really depends on-

713
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,280
I'd say it depends, but usually they're not chained.

714
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,159
Like basically you finish the puzzle

715
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,160
or solve the challenge, the new challenge opens.

716
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,280
It really depends.

717
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,959
Is there any help or any hints or anything like that?

718
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,439
Yeah, it's a penalty points for hints as well.

719
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,280
Penalty.

720
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,319
Penalty points so you get for soften to reveal the hint.

721
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,880
Now whether the quality of that hint will be good or not.

722
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,560
That's another topic, but you get some,

723
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,959
it's more like a competition.

724
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,719
So kind of you learn through the competition

725
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,000
and often actually it works.

726
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like I, back in the days, we built some CTF challenges

727
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,160
for some international conferences.

728
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,160
And I know for the fact that one of that very good CTF team

729
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:49,439
that they didn't touch cryptography type challenges.

730
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:52,880
They had no idea about different encryption

731
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,680
or decryption type algorithms,

732
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,800
but throughout that CTF period for that conference,

733
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,920
which normally runs two to three days,

734
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,239
they actually went and start learning about it,

735
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:07,439
reading articles and eventually solve that challenge,

736
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:10,040
which the guy was telling me that in a normal cases,

737
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,520
I wouldn't bother even to read about this.

738
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Kind of, I was like, okay,

739
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,400
but now because of this sense of competition

740
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
and like actually now I know,

741
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,599
like there's a lot of things I can go and check out for it.

742
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,599
And you think like being good at CTFs,

743
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,880
like sort of a good starting point in security career or?

744
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,040
I think you can immediately test

745
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,439
or compare your skillset to others.

746
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,839
It's very hands-on like interactive.

747
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:47,760
So if you talk about like the life cycle

748
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,119
of like a security issue,

749
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,040
I mean, the first thing is you need

750
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,479
to find the security issue, finding a vulnerability.

751
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:58,640
Okay, there are some perhaps techniques

752
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,599
you can follow to find that,

753
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,560
but then it comes the exploitation phase,

754
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,640
which I typically call it is at the most closer than art

755
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,560
because it depends,

756
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,479
like often when you are engaged by a customer

757
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,640
to do a security assessment,

758
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,680
you may find an interesting security issue,

759
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,560
but just to turn that and prove to them

760
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,719
that this is really bad,

761
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,640
it may take you the rest of the duration of the engagement

762
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,119
just to demonstrate one security issue

763
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,359
has a really major impact on the environment.

764
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:36,400
So I think someone who,

765
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,439
I feel when you go through that exploitation phase,

766
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,560
you actually learn quite a lot

767
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,160
and you really understand a lot of quirks.

768
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,160
Like when you are a security, well, security researcher,

769
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,400
we don't have the luxury of having a debugger

770
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,560
as like a software engineers

771
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,160
that you can just attach to the program,

772
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,239
figure out what's happened.

773
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:59,800
Like there is like nothing like that.

774
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,000
You kind of, a lot of times,

775
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,079
yeah, it's a lot of trial and error.

776
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,760
A lot of times there's a lack of tooling

777
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,959
even to interface with something.

778
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:11,719
So it's a lot of complexity involved in there.

779
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:12,560
So I think.

780
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,640
But like experience from like a sec docs

781
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,800
we run in Ljubljana,

782
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,400
like that few CTFs that we had,

783
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:31,040
it was interesting that like on the guys

784
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,359
who were leading on like highest on the scoreboard

785
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:36,439
were actually developers.

786
00:45:36,439 --> 00:45:39,640
So not people like dealing with security

787
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,040
or solving the CTFs.

788
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,199
There were like few guys that like really,

789
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:49,040
when the problem is presented

790
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,920
or the puzzle that was presented,

791
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,119
they start like really thinking outside of the box

792
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,439
because all other, let's say security people

793
00:45:57,439 --> 00:46:00,439
that working security were relying on tools,

794
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,599
relying on, okay,

795
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,680
which tool should I use to extract something out

796
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,000
in compared to the developer who was thinking,

797
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,880
okay, what am I seeing here?

798
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,000
How can I, so.

799
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,359
Exactly.

800
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:16,920
There have been so many cases like that,

801
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,239
that people who are completely new,

802
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,319
let's say to security,

803
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,719
they come to SecDocs

804
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,719
and then they are taught in a ladder work.

805
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,880
The other things like sometimes

806
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,040
we had actually a specific case in Sydney

807
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,199
that one of the top players a few years ago,

808
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,400
he actually didn't even know about all these toolings

809
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,239
that is available,

810
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,280
like some of these Python libraries that are available

811
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,280
just to make the reversing that super easy.

812
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,079
He was just building everything,

813
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,040
thinking about it, reasoning about it.

814
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,880
Me.

815
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,719
And writing it.

816
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:51,400
I'm like that in these cases.

817
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,959
When he was presenting that

818
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,199
and then these like,

819
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:55,839
there's a lot of also students coming in.

820
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,400
They are looking at this kind of, wow,

821
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,760
like the algorithm that he built, for example,

822
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,800
to prove that, I don't know,

823
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,160
to crack the hash.

824
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,959
And they were telling him after the talk that,

825
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:08,079
you know, you just make a call to this library

826
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,640
that exactly the algorithm you have.

827
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,719
Yeah, if you don't know what's in the toolbox,

828
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:14,680
you can't use it.

829
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,880
Yeah, but on the other side,

830
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,239
like you also get,

831
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,199
like usually there are multiple ways

832
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,040
how to solve the puzzle.

833
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,640
And like it was a thing in Unix world,

834
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,479
like there are many ways to skin a cat.

835
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:34,479
Like whoever won present the solution,

836
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,400
like then you can like start comparing

837
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
whether you were thinking the same

838
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,920
or using the same methods or different.

839
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,959
So, yeah.

840
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:48,319
My observation of one of these psych talks

841
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,119
was like, it was very interesting

842
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:51,839
because I like, I saw a couple of guys

843
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,800
that were programmers

844
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,680
because there is no like limit

845
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,880
what tools you can use or not use.

846
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:01,439
Somebody is writing something in Perl.

847
00:48:01,439 --> 00:48:02,439
Somebody just said,

848
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:04,560
I'm just gonna throw this code

849
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,439
that needs to be encrypted or decrypted

850
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:09,119
into spreadsheets or bash.

851
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,000
It doesn't really matter.

852
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,400
It's just whatever tools you use.

853
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,119
So that's very interesting.

854
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:17,040
I just remember there's an interesting story

855
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,760
how you two met, right?

856
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,599
Yeah.

857
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,800
Yeah, you remember?

858
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,000
I caused more problems.

859
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:24,959
Yeah.

860
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:28,119
I just remember today

861
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:30,280
and said to Otto that it's funny

862
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,280
because I think it's worth saying

863
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,319
how you two-

864
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:36,719
Obviously it's your fault, right?

865
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:37,560
So-

866
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,400
Yeah.

867
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,599
I mean, it's your fault

868
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,959
for solving the challenge

869
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,599
and revealing the secret.

870
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,160
I don't remember everything,

871
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,839
but I know that,

872
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:47,920
so we have the Slack

873
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,680
and you just dropped in the page

874
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,199
from Pedram's website.

875
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,599
And there's like a capture the flag

876
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,920
kind of a thing on his-

877
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,520
No, he was like hiring-

878
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,400
I didn't read that.

879
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,599
I just saw it's a capture the flag,

880
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,800
something with Docker.

881
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,319
So you didn't know what was it?

882
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,640
I didn't know.

883
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,880
There was just like this page

884
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,160
and Loki posted it.

885
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,280
And I was like,

886
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,880
okay, I'm gonna look, what's that?

887
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,239
Just play with him

888
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,119
because I think it was dependent on Python.

889
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,479
I just wanna like play with it

890
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:25,119
so that I can show off Python from him

891
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,359
because I know he tries to avoid programming

892
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,439
as much as possible.

893
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,640
And yeah, there was something

894
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,119
with the Docker container.

895
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:35,719
I can't remember what it was,

896
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:38,000
but yeah, it had some cipher in there

897
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,839
and some environment keys.

898
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,119
And I just like, like you said,

899
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,800
I looked into how to blow up this bridge.

900
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,800
Yeah, and then you wrote a blog post on your site.

901
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:55,160
I wrote like, I didn't, yeah.

903
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,000
That's like-

904
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,839
And that's when you contacted him.

905
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:58,680
Yeah, that's yeah.

906
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,079
Hey, whatever, here is a writer.

907
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,760
Did you know what you saw? That was our career entrance.

908
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Yeah, because what I did is like, when I was doing this, I wanted to just have a document

909
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,080
describing all the steps that I did.

910
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,040
So I wrote down everything and I was like, I needed something for my blog at the time.

911
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,719
I was like, okay, I'm going to write this down, right?

912
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,719
And then in the end, the last step was like, send email and then it was like, your email

913
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,320
and send the email and send the blog post attached to it.

914
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,560
And that was stupid and in hindsight, yeah, I know, I'm sorry for that.

915
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
I think I apologized.

916
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Why didn't you apologize?

917
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Then you put it public.

918
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,560
Yeah.

919
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,360
I put it public, yeah, that was a shitty thing to do.

920
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,400
And perhaps that could be a nice segue into discussion about hacking and ethics probably

921
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,400
and what you said, what's the term, disclosure.

922
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Full disclosure.

923
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,560
Full disclosure, 90 days and everything, yeah.

924
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:03,119
It just made it harder for other people to apply because that's the thing, you can't

925
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,239
necessarily stop people to write, write up about your challenges, right?

926
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:09,440
But we'll make a better challenge, the next challenge.

927
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,959
So Jan, you hope that they will read that right up.

928
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:14,239
Well, I didn't get, I didn't get the job.

929
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,000
So the next guy must probably be better than I am.

930
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,639
For me, like it was interesting because it was a job ad basically.

931
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:32,919
And I saw this as a very creative job ad because you need to like solve the puzzle to actually

932
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:36,400
know what, like how to contact you.

933
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,199
Well, you needed to know a lot of stuff.

934
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:43,360
You needed to know, of course, you needed to know what is Caesar cipher, I think it

935
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:49,519
was there, environment variables, Docker, missing things, Python code.

936
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:57,360
There was a lot of these very things that I saw in my professional career, how these

937
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,959
things work.

938
00:51:58,959 --> 00:51:59,959
And yeah.

939
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:06,800
So I imagine in your company, you're looking for people that have some solid engineering

940
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:15,440
background, but they also like are curious to extreme or something like, yeah.

941
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:24,600
You know, like maybe we could like cut here and enjoy the glass of water, I'll do commercials.

942
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,399
So Otto will now present the commercials.

943
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:34,160
So if you guys enjoy this podcast and if you want to keep enjoying it and it will really

944
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:41,800
help us if you join us and support us, there's a link below in the footnotes.

945
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,639
So yeah, join our Patreon supporters and it will mean a lot to us and we will be able

946
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:48,520
to make this wonderful content.

947
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,440
Oh, here you go.

948
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,440
So let's start the next section.

949
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,080
So what I wanted to talk about is application security.

950
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:13,360
So in terms of you now being on this defensive side where like you educate developers and

951
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:26,880
give them this knowledge of how to like apply security in, let's call it life cycle of development

952
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:29,919
life cycle.

953
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:39,199
And where to start for application security from developer's perspective.

954
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:47,000
May I like kind of like expand his question, like software development cycle means that

955
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,399
there are different phases in the development of software.

956
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:54,320
So you have planning, designing, implementation, testing, deployment, and then some maintenance,

957
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
right?

958
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,399
You have all these steps.

959
00:53:56,919 --> 00:54:01,880
And traditionally what companies did is like, they went through all these steps, released

960
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,479
the product, and then probably perhaps also hired some pen tester because company that

961
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:12,399
was trying to buy it or something wanted some audit or something like that.

962
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:17,279
But that's not how things should be done if I understand correctly.

963
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:20,399
And is that like a good intro to this section?

964
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:23,399
I'm prepared to apply it on all of this.

965
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:24,399
Yeah.

966
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:25,399
The earlier is better.

967
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:26,399
Yeah.

968
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:29,760
More like you can't really, it's a non-functional requirement, right?

969
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,160
This is one of those that can't really have a face for it, but it's kind of applies everywhere.

970
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:43,920
I mean, I'm trying to think about the question, like, is it more, you know, I think for one

971
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,440
of the things I found out after working with, I mean, one of the reasons I actually started

972
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:55,079
working more on a defensive side was more, was the problems that I always have this interest

973
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:57,959
that find the root cause where the issue really is.

974
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:03,399
Like, you know, you do a code audit, a secure code audit, and you do penetration testing

975
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:11,200
and you can see a trend of security issues that just keep appearing, keep appearing.

976
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,200
And one approach to that is like, yeah, they don't understand that it's more approach of

977
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,200
us versus them.

978
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,959
Like, you know, they're just, I don't know, dark dumb, these guys, they don't give a shit

979
00:55:22,959 --> 00:55:23,959
about security.

980
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:24,959
Okay.

981
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:25,959
Whatever.

982
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:29,079
And I'm going to just, you know, just do the same thing.

983
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:34,480
But the other approach for me, which was more interesting was like, why, like why this,

984
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,160
because that security issue that normally you find in a environment or a system, it's

985
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:47,119
an edge case that, well, I wish I, that, that program does.

986
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,880
So why it is not that interesting for those developers to, to, to, to pay attention to

987
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,000
it.

988
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,799
So this, this was a part that I, it didn't easy with me that why they don't pay attention

989
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:06,079
to this, like why they don't really go after fixing it.

990
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:12,320
And well, I started exploring their, their field even more, like what is actually happening

991
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,160
in the whole software engineering industry, how the software is being built, building

992
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:21,119
a software is, is one thing, but you know, keeping it online, the prod is, it's a completely

993
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,359
different thing, right?

994
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:28,839
So you then try to understand the, the limitation, the restrictions, and then you, sometimes

995
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:33,600
you have this understanding, Hey, a lot of those security recommendations that you give

996
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,279
is actually going to break the whole thing.

997
00:56:36,279 --> 00:56:39,019
Like it is not applicable.

998
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:44,519
So parts of that is related to it, but parts of that is a lack of understanding and awareness.

999
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,720
I feel actually security need to be redefined for a lot of engineers.

1000
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,320
Like I found a lot of times we are, they are so biased toward that.

1001
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,399
What security is, you know, you, you will, you will talk with developers from one company.

1002
00:56:59,399 --> 00:57:04,040
You will find that they are security for them is dependency scanning.

1003
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:08,000
And for the other ones, Oh, man in the middle, man in the middle, if it happens, it's bad.

1004
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It doesn't happen.

1005
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
We are safe.

1006
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,359
The other, or the other ones like phishing, the other one is, Oh yeah, we need to keep

1007
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,200
our passwords long.

1008
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
It's authentication.

1009
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,279
And you kind of, you bias toward that and you feel that's the security, but versus Bell

1010
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:26,440
security is old and above all those things.

1011
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:35,119
I think that's where my interest kind of started kind of going, rather than being a game of

1012
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,839
us versus them be security guys, we find bugs, you guys need to fix it.

1013
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:46,399
Just trying to understand, trying to bridge this gap.

1014
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:51,440
You know, one of the things I mentioned earlier, that if this is a software engineering podcast,

1015
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,040
because in the terminology, even we use in security industry is different from often

1016
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,040
vulnerability.

1017
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,959
But by the end of the day, there's a bug, a defect, right?

1018
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:05,000
So it can be a feature.

1019
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:14,720
So if it's a design flow, then this is a feature, but it's like, one is actually opportunity.

1020
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,679
The other is a problem kind of thing.

1021
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:20,279
It's kind of redefining that, right?

1022
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:25,119
So by the end of the day, in a lot of cases, if you think about security vulnerability

1023
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:32,200
is a runtime exception, that kind of communicates better with engineers, but for us in security

1024
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,719
domain, it's a vulnerability, we call it.

1025
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:42,239
So I think even just bridging those gaps, trying to understand kind of the other side

1026
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:50,159
of the game a little bit more, and then, well, asking them to help, because if you look at

1027
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:57,799
the, if I look at the history of some security issues that was really addressed, you will

1028
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:03,359
see there was an engineering team that they embed this kind of security control within

1029
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,359
the framework.

1030
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:09,280
An obvious example of it is, for example, a skill injection, right?

1031
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:15,640
A skill injection kind of had gone away in majority of the cases, not because suddenly

1032
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:22,559
we have an aware community of developers, but because the framework sees that you write

1033
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,640
the code in it, it just doesn't allow you that raw access to the query.

1034
00:59:28,479 --> 00:59:35,840
So you're saying in a way there are, I don't know, frameworks or programming languages

1035
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:45,039
that are like safer for unskilled developers to produce safe code?

1036
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,039
Safe code, yeah.

1037
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,320
Can you, like, is this what you're trying to say?

1038
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:57,280
Or can you say, like, for instance, that there is a, I don't know, framework that is like

1039
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:04,599
a bit more, like, stupidity proof?

1040
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:05,599
How should I say?

1041
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:06,599
Stupid proof.

1042
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:15,479
I mean, there's definitely frameworks that sort of prevent someone to shoot in the legs.

1043
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:16,479
Yeah.

1044
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:17,479
Definitely.

1045
01:00:17,479 --> 01:00:18,479
There are there.

1046
01:00:18,479 --> 01:00:19,479
Because-

1047
01:00:19,479 --> 01:00:22,880
For a subset of security issues, right?

1048
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,039
There are, I always make this example that if someone writes a PHP app and making it

1049
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:35,239
secure, I will hire that guy because it means he's damn good in security as well, versus

1050
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:39,960
a guy who write the same application in ASP.NET, for example, because the framework itself

1051
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,919
does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of, like, it doesn't even just make example of, and

1052
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:51,919
there isn't a, I know this is because in my team, we often, we create security challenges

1053
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,080
for software engineers.

1054
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,400
And then we need to convert that to multiple languages.

1055
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,919
And often it's really hard to convert it in one framework versus, or versus one language.

1056
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:07,280
It also exposes us that the maturity in a different, you know, communities of these

1057
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:14,400
languages and yet some frameworks, like, we can't even introduce that security bug in

1058
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,440
them, just because the framework just-

1059
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:24,799
It means disabling so many default protection mechanisms that you really need to pay a lot

1060
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:28,840
of effort into disabling all these whistles and blows and fear.

1061
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Exactly.

1062
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,840
Yeah.

1063
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:38,679
So in a way, like when, like this is sort of a, for developers, when like in this planning

1064
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:43,640
phase, what stack to choose or what platform to choose or what programming language to

1065
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,320
choose can also-

1066
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:51,320
Perhaps the question is, the first question in this planning phase is like discussing

1067
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,200
perhaps even with stakeholders and how secure should this stuff be?

1068
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,000
Like, are you running on very personal data or is this just, you know, a random blog or,

1069
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,840
you know, I think I would start there, right?

1070
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,599
What does this thing need to do?

1071
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:08,599
What kind of data does it store?

1072
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,679
You know, are there any regulations or-

1073
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:13,960
Usually it is the other way around.

1074
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:23,400
Usually the senior engineers like choose the sexiest, the hottest framework or programming

1075
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,039
language out there.

1076
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:30,559
And because this is the something like everybody is working on and that's the pick.

1077
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,320
That's the weapon of choice.

1078
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,359
So we're victims of hype-driven development.

1079
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,359
In a way.

1080
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:39,359
Yeah.

1081
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:47,119
I don't think you're going to get this answer.

1082
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,400
I mean, again, all these, you know, especially if these are old established frameworks, they

1083
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,840
have special teams, they do additional security audits regularly.

1084
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:05,119
So if you have these kinds of frameworks that are out there for a long time, I think probably

1085
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,719
people have looked at the code.

1086
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:14,799
They did, you know, that part you kind of like believe that checks were done, right?

1087
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:21,320
With new stuff, you know, there's always opportunity to find something there.

1088
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:27,599
But equally, like if you have very old code bases, if, you know, you have software that

1089
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:33,719
is written by a lot of engineers during a lot of different periods when, you know, company

1090
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:39,000
was small and then became big and you have poor, and that's probably the next question,

1091
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,400
security culture in the company, you know, people doing sloppy jobs.

1092
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,799
It's essentially a big attack surface, I guess.

1093
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:54,320
I don't know that, Otto, because I like to think that way, but then you look at some

1094
01:03:54,320 --> 01:04:00,960
of the trend of security ones that reported even this year in really old codes, the codes

1095
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,919
that are open source, the code that is out there, the code that has been audited and

1096
01:04:04,919 --> 01:04:11,599
most likely being scanned by numerous applications, and still you find, whoa, like security issues

1097
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,039
there.

1098
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:20,039
On the other side, we actually have some people in security that they lost hope that, sorry,

1099
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:24,880
we can't teach devs how to write a secure code, they just make it harder for them to

1100
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,760
build something, at least that will eventually result into in a more secure stage, is a mix

1101
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:36,799
of things that you will find, I mean, you kind of assume that the new frameworks may

1102
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:43,880
have more holes, but not necessarily, it could be a security issue related to a library that

1103
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:49,559
they are using and there is a security bug there and then it goes on.

1104
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:55,559
But you know, today you don't use just framework, you also use third party libraries, you also

1105
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:03,320
inject, I don't know, ads in your page through whatever, you know, people use, they install

1106
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:09,159
a lot of different things on their devices, so there's a lot of potential to...

1107
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:15,000
So you shouldn't limit yourself to only your part of the code, but the whole ecosystem,

1108
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
the whole system.

1109
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,359
But I think we still need to be like pragmatic, right, in the end of the day, developers do

1110
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,159
need to ship something in a reasonable amount of time.

1111
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:26,159
Sure.

1112
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:27,159
Yeah.

1113
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:34,159
The way I see it, like the simple exercise, like I think like each developer team should

1114
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:41,080
do is threat modeling in terms of understanding what are the...

1115
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,799
Please explain this to our audience.

1116
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:57,799
So in a way of writing down or using a diagram way of how your application is working and

1117
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:09,000
how data is going through your application, where are like possibilities of sort of risk

1118
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:16,200
that could happen and how are you going to prevent this from happening and like it gives

1119
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:23,840
you a way to sort of do in a way risk management.

1120
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:33,000
But also this exercise is also good in a way to you figuring out what are your crown jewels.

1121
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,719
So basically, what are you actually going to protect?

1122
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:42,080
Because sometimes like there are people that are investing a lot of money in, I don't know,

1123
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:49,640
web application firewalls and protecting completely like things that are not that important.

1124
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:56,400
But on the other hand, they might say have the like personal data unencrypted somewhere

1125
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,440
and they are doing like maybe the backups that are also unencrypted and that, I don't

1126
01:07:01,479 --> 01:07:04,119
know, shipping that to S3 bucket.

1127
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:08,680
Is it enough to just write this down and make sure that everybody understands this or do

1128
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,280
you periodically then monitor these things?

1129
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,280
Of course.

1130
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:19,680
Like in a way you want to, like the way I see it, you want to like when doing a new

1131
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:27,680
features to the application or product you're developing, you again do this threat modeling

1132
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:34,079
because in a way you already create one and one of the new features, you will see how

1133
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,800
this affects the whole system.

1134
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,800
Yeah.

1135
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,959
I mean, threat modeling definitely, I'll actually call it a rapid threat modeling, something

1136
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:44,920
that is more effective.

1137
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:49,839
The problem I found is, again, it's hard to get devs to think about threats.

1138
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:54,560
It kind of comes back to the old conversation we have builder and breaker mindset.

1139
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,839
People who are good in building something does not necessarily know how things can break

1140
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:01,520
and it's completely understandable.

1141
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:07,119
So it's kind of also you need to kind of empower them one more level that, okay, these are

1142
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,199
the possible things can go wrong regardless of what feature you're working on.

1143
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,599
Think about whether this could be applicable to the things because...

1144
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:23,160
Are these things like, we now have these static code analyzers that read the code and spit

1145
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:30,079
out, I don't know, potential issues that are like wrong use of code or static code

1146
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,040
analyzers check the code, but they can also...

1147
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,119
You have similar tools to kind of like security testing as well.

1148
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:42,079
Is that enough or we need to also build awareness and knowledge in developers?

1149
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:43,079
Everything.

1150
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:44,079
Everything.

1151
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:45,079
You throw everything at it.

1152
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,079
Everything.

1153
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,760
Whatever you can do in a security, just do it.

1154
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:56,439
It's such a chaotic, unfortunate environment that I personally think, and I have examples

1155
01:08:56,439 --> 01:09:01,199
of that, that when devs are on board with the idea of the security is important, we

1156
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,680
should take it seriously.

1157
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,079
You go miles away in terms of your security culture and maturity rather than if you want

1158
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:12,560
the tool to tell you whether you're doing something good or not.

1159
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,560
Because oftentimes, I mean, I'm not talking about the false positive, false negatives

1160
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,319
and most likely you've dealt with it a lot, but it's not going to change the culture.

1161
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:23,079
It's not going to change the understanding.

1162
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:26,239
For me, the problem actually starts in the brain of that.

1163
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:29,560
I'm going to challenge you here on this.

1164
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,319
These organizations, responsibility starts from the top, right?

1165
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:41,599
So I need to sell your service and your services to my boss as engineer or engineering lead,

1166
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:42,599
right?

1167
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:47,079
How do you convince people from top down that security is so important that they're

1168
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:53,920
going to now invest into tools or education of their developers so that it becomes something

1169
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,040
that the company should care about?

1170
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,400
So how do you propagate that information from the top to the bottom?

1171
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,839
Do you need to convince people that, you know, we're going to lose a lot of money or we're

1172
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:08,880
going to have bad publicity or all of these things?

1173
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,640
I don't know.

1174
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,880
I don't even know someone who knows much.

1175
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,760
I mean, in reality, still, there is a lot of security budgets are being approved because

1176
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,239
of compliance requirement, because of some legislation.

1177
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,239
And that's true.

1178
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:28,400
You see the amount of security assessment done by organization and financial sectors.

1179
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:34,119
Well, the one reason may not be so much about leaking data is because of compliance.

1180
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:38,520
Of course, leaking data financial thing is a serious thing.

1181
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:46,520
But I think still that has a great, you know, power to it.

1182
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,959
Like, yeah, there was a standard.

1183
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:48,959
How do you convince that guy?

1184
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:49,959
I don't know.

1185
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:55,880
To be honest, like security is pretty hard to sell.

1186
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:11,239
Like basically, on one hand, you might choose to do sort of like those scarcity and say

1187
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:18,680
how into what is like out there on the Internet and how you're going to be hacked and impounded.

1188
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,400
I actually want to say something.

1189
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,160
My job at the moment is not so much dealing with the people higher up.

1190
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,199
It's actually hard to convince the developer to think about security because that's for

1191
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:33,599
me is a bigger problem.

1192
01:11:33,599 --> 01:11:42,000
How you make security interesting and engaging for a software engineer.

1193
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:50,839
Because by the end of the day, whatever security issue we have is a rare use case or edge case.

1194
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:55,640
And if you look at the backlog of what this dev guy is going to do is like this feature,

1195
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,640
that feature.

1196
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,359
But most of it is filled with lots of other bugs.

1197
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:04,479
How would you make the old security bug being something on top of that, that, hey, it needs

1198
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:06,599
immediate attention?

1199
01:12:06,599 --> 01:12:08,800
So we're dealing with those priorities as well.

1200
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:16,000
But I think that's the part for me is interesting to talk like, what are the things would make

1201
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,959
security interesting for engineers?

1202
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,000
Because that's all my hope here.

1203
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,000
And what do you propose?

1204
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,160
How do you make it interesting?

1205
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,800
You gave me fun.

1206
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,800
You want us to start?

1207
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,439
No, no, no.

1208
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:32,439
It's a good question.

1209
01:12:32,439 --> 01:12:34,000
That's a segue to the next.

1210
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Yeah.

1211
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:46,280
But still, I still want to be here at Application Security and maybe start before going, how

1212
01:12:46,280 --> 01:13:02,959
to do this education purpose, or do this education of developers, how to explain security

1213
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:12,280
to them, how to make them engage in this, like what he said, with gamification of this

1214
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:22,959
or showing real examples and showing the code, or is like what usually, or let's say

1215
01:13:22,959 --> 01:13:31,479
usually is done, like there's external pen test, like breaking down the code and just

1216
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:37,560
sending the report to R&D and saying this, everything you see on the report is broken.

1217
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,439
You need to fix it.

1218
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:40,439
What's the...

1219
01:13:40,599 --> 01:13:43,800
Definitely, I can say things that doesn't work is top-down approach.

1220
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,719
Like if a manager said that, you have to do security, that's not going to work, or you

1221
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:51,400
have to do this security, I mean, address that, that's not going to change anything

1222
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,079
in that dev's mindset that security is important.

1223
01:13:55,079 --> 01:14:01,839
But things kind of learning more about their worldview of what they would care.

1224
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:05,880
Like I found every developer is interested in problem solving.

1225
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,640
They are interested and engaged in, well, make something better.

1226
01:14:09,839 --> 01:14:10,839
Well, guess what?

1227
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:14,400
When you make a software secure, you have a better code quality.

1228
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,119
You may have even better, more reliable application.

1229
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:25,680
Kind of trying to highlight these angles more than it's just the edge case that, hey, no,

1230
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,319
actually your program does more than what it should.

1231
01:14:29,319 --> 01:14:35,599
Well, for example, you just need to, you just make example of a calculator that needs to

1232
01:14:35,599 --> 01:14:37,959
take two numbers and give you a result.

1233
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,400
You can implement that in many different ways.

1234
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:49,079
When you show that a certain way of implementation of that calculator could also allow someone

1235
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:55,119
to inject additional code and execute code using your calculator and kind of saying that,

1236
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:57,959
but by the end of the day, you just wanted to build a calculator.

1237
01:14:57,959 --> 01:14:59,959
Why you just don't make your software just.

1238
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,880
calculation. Don't worry about what else can happen, just that part. It actually makes their

1239
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:15,760
software to do that things even better. So that's what I find is interesting. Of course, the whole

1240
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,320
concept of gamification also is proven. I feel competition also, it's something that helps.

1241
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:34,240
But if, stay on this, what would be, I don't know, to maintain secure hygiene inside

1242
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,240
development lifecycle? What would be steps that...

1243
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,639
I think it's just everyone's job. I think, first of all, start thinking about this is

1244
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,240
that the security team should are a gatekeeper of our organization.

1245
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:59,759
Sure. But what would be, I don't know, five, three top things that each company or each

1246
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:10,959
business that is focusing in development should invest effort, money, what to consider?

1247
01:16:11,919 --> 01:16:17,919
I mean, some of the key things there is a lot of things, but

1248
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:29,360
just this understanding that perhaps security is not a single team's job,

1249
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,279
and showing them a real example of that, an incident that actually happened,

1250
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:41,599
that proved the case that if security, if we're just relying on just an audit to come through,

1251
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:50,239
or things like that, how many things can be missed? You can't have your junior developers

1252
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:55,199
or even senior developers advocating about security, and then you have your tech leads

1253
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:00,320
and software architect that pushing for features that need to be released yesterday. That doesn't

1254
01:17:00,959 --> 01:17:09,279
work. You need to give your team a time to think twice about the code that they write,

1255
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:14,479
the design that they build, which kind of contradicts with the speed of a lot of businesses

1256
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:20,240
going this way. But sorry to say that is to make a software usable is one thing,

1257
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:24,720
but to make it secure is another thing. You can make a software that perfectly function,

1258
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:31,279
but it isn't secure. What will take you to go there? Well, one fact is just give your team more

1259
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:38,320
time. Because there are cases that I had, the team, the devs, they're really on board with the

1260
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,399
idea that I really like to do trade modeling. I really like to follow this secure design pattern

1261
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:51,199
to implement my code. But the thing is, I can't, because I'm not even given the time to do it.

1262
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,360
So I think that's a bigger problem to solve first. And then after that, once you have that

1263
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:07,440
established, then making devs more familiar with the ways that things are going to get

1264
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:14,240
exploited. And kind of making them more familiar with this breaker mindset that

1265
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:21,520
so they can start thinking intuitively about, well, what can go wrong? Rather than just thinking

1266
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,320
about what program should do, they should also think about what program should not do,

1267
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:34,000
which is again, the sky is the limit. I'm worried.

1268
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:43,839
Some questions should, like in the process of quality assurance, should also like a security

1269
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:51,119
test be part of this? I think it's okay. Isn't it already there? I don't know. Usually are not.

1270
01:18:51,839 --> 01:19:01,199
Usually like QA is focusing on usability and if the product is like reaching

1271
01:19:01,919 --> 01:19:09,839
some performance that is expected and so on. But usually the security is left out.

1272
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:19,119
Well, last time I was sort of a situation like the feature went through the Q&A.

1273
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:28,799
Everything was like great. And then on the bug bounty, it sort of found a huge security

1274
01:19:28,799 --> 01:19:36,799
flaw. And then like we sort of go back to Q&A, it wasn't that tested. And they were like, well,

1275
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,799
that's not expected to be an input.

1276
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:44,640
Why would someone do that?

1277
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,320
Exactly. They were like questioning, why would somebody do that?

1278
01:19:48,959 --> 01:19:56,880
So it's not essentially the QA's job is not to do security audit or look for that kind of loops.

1279
01:19:57,519 --> 01:20:04,799
I mean, they can help. But again, the way that we are, again, my knowledge of it is

1280
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:11,119
limited to, again, to those people who we try to train them as a QA to kind of look for

1281
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:18,880
security issues. But there are two things you reach there is like their skill level.

1282
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,720
That's one thing. And the second is the defined task of things that they have to do. Like often

1283
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:32,399
they may need to use the UI interface to interact with their backend versus you may find actually,

1284
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:37,040
if you remove that UI, you just directly interact with the API, you can find security issues there.

1285
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:42,079
But that's not even defined in the, that's not even their job because they, one of us said,

1286
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:47,119
you know, their usability is actually more highlighted there than these security edge

1287
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:54,000
cases. So that's what I said, throw everything at it. It's just whatever you think is suitable

1288
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:01,760
for your organization. I'm going to use this, throw everything at it. You have this beautiful

1289
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:10,399
product and a service as well. I imagine it's called SecDim. So SecTalks is events,

1290
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:17,760
but SecDim is your company if I understand correctly. And what you guys do is very

1291
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:24,320
mix of the things that we described here, but you kind of like offer these things to companies.

1292
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:29,519
That's kind of like, but I will still invite you to explain to us what SecDim is and what you guys do.

1293
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:36,640
Yeah, so it pretty much started with workshops, running secure development workshops for

1294
01:21:38,799 --> 01:21:44,000
developers. We actually started right in the middle of COVID, the start of the COVID.

1295
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,640
Beautiful time.

1296
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:54,959
And then it kind of started with that because I felt that's like a missing part. We do need

1297
01:21:54,959 --> 01:22:00,799
to get more engineers involved to help us to solve some security problems. I'm not just talking

1298
01:22:00,799 --> 01:22:05,359
about developers to be able to put a patch here and there. I'm talking about those more like

1299
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:12,160
fundamental solutions. Like can they put something in the compiler? Can they think about a popular

1300
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:16,640
third-party library that won't disallow these things? So this is, I think, more

1301
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:22,320
on engineering side to solve that. So that's why I kind of, I reached out more on that.

1302
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:29,519
So the workshops, these are the things we regularly run for companies privately. We do

1303
01:22:29,519 --> 01:22:35,679
have also public workshops. The focus is effectively how to build a defensive software from

1304
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:44,079
scratch. So rather than bombarding the engineers or devs with, oh, this security issue, that security

1305
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:50,079
bug, that vulnerability, is there anything else we can do that you kind of, when you start writing

1306
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:55,760
a software, you follow that or some of those principles and can make your software relatively

1307
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:04,160
reliably secure. That's one thing. And as part of that, this platform came out, which

1308
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:13,359
again was outreach to the people to, hey, you want to try to see how a security bug

1309
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:22,079
well can be addressed. Now, one thing I actually found, but through experience, I found is missing

1310
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,799
is that, so when I started, you know, we talked about capture the flag. When I started

1311
01:23:27,519 --> 01:23:36,400
delivering my workshops a few years ago, it was to make developers more engaged in security,

1312
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:41,359
definitely I would include the CTF part that, hey, you know, it's the end of the workshop,

1313
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,640
just do a CTF, just hack some things. And, you know, someone at the end will be,

1314
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,320
it was engaging. It was interesting. Perhaps they would learn a new security issue,

1315
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,039
but there was always this problem missing. By the end of the day, this person needs to go back and

1316
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:59,679
fix this, but we haven't even talked about that part. This is out of a scope for security, right?

1317
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:05,520
You deal with that. I told you the bug, you figure out how to fix it. And that's how I felt where

1318
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:15,599
the problem is. Like we may these days talk good about some of the security issues that we have

1319
01:24:15,599 --> 01:24:22,719
normally in a security language, but we don't really talk so much about ways and bad ways of

1320
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:30,000
fixing it. So the idea of this platform I built was, well, we have captured the black. How about

1321
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,840
we have thing called fix the flag. So you go to school, sort of a reverse capture the flag,

1322
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,919
reverse capture, but you, I even show you where is the security bug is,

1323
01:24:39,919 --> 01:24:46,400
but you only get the score if you fix it in the right way. Now, originally,

1324
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:54,239
some of those, the ways that we were testing, if someone can fix the flag was too restrictive. And

1325
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:01,840
to my, well, kind of, I learned that, well, no, this is a huge lack of understanding and awareness

1326
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:08,159
somewhere. So we needed to kind of relax that. But now it's interesting just to see how people

1327
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:15,280
actually think about a single problem, but they fix it in a completely different way. And

1328
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:23,599
obviously also learning how to, well, make something or write a better patch for something

1329
01:25:23,599 --> 01:25:31,760
that I'm publishing. So in practical terms, you know, you log into the SegDyn website,

1330
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:37,599
probably you can do this on your own or you also offer workshop. As I said, you get like a

1331
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:45,760
you get like a zip file or a repository of a code that it has security vulnerability.

1332
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,000
And then you try to fix it and then you upload it. And the tool will tell you if you actually

1333
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,799
solved the problem or not. Right. That's the mechanics of this thing. Right.

1334
01:25:56,799 --> 01:26:02,719
So the idea was exactly. So kind of, you bring those security issues to the language that

1335
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,559
developers understand. So, and the tooling that the developers, they have, like, so you have

1336
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:13,520
Git, you have containers, you know, and translate to some of the security issues.

1337
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,080
So let's just call it, I don't know, the one that I talk about new integer workflow,

1338
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:26,159
not necessarily in a text or a video recording of me talking. Translate that to a test that

1339
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:32,000
developers will deal with it on a daily basis. And the goal of the challenge is that can you pass

1340
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,559
the test? Now, depending on the complexity of the challenge, you, you may be given the test

1341
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:42,960
so you can clearly see what is the, what is the input? What is the expected output that as it gets

1342
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:48,559
more challenging, the tests are missing because the idea is that, well, the hacker will never

1343
01:26:48,559 --> 01:26:53,119
give you their test. You have to figure that out yourself. Okay. That's an improvement then there.

1344
01:26:53,919 --> 01:27:02,640
Okay. Okay. So, but also encouraging developers in very like a implicit way that maybe you want

1345
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:08,320
to think about writing these tests yourself for your program. You learn that if a program just

1346
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:13,599
deal with two numbers, right? There are these usability tests that it has to always pass,

1347
01:27:13,599 --> 01:27:18,960
but how about these other things that can result in a security issue? So it's a kind of, they,

1348
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,239
they learn it by, by practicing and the other, other things that are, you know, getting the score

1349
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:29,919
and like getting their name on the, on the ladder board is like more like cream on the top. But

1350
01:27:29,919 --> 01:27:37,039
there, yeah. I had to, maybe, please, please, please let me, please. And I'll let you, I found

1351
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:45,039
it very interesting. Like you don't just say, you know, this is integer overflow assignment or

1352
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:54,000
something. You have these kind of like practical stories, how a company got hacked or how literally

1353
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,919
millions or billions were lost because of this exploit, which means that there is a real world

1354
01:27:59,919 --> 01:28:05,359
connection of this security issue that you actually learn about. Can you tell us a bit

1355
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:09,200
more, how do you design these things? Interesting you mentioned, because that happened again

1356
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,479
throughout some of my workshops that I found in security, we are not really great in naming

1357
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:18,640
something. We actually really good and naming something really complex. Like I don't know,

1358
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:25,200
cross-site request forgery or server-side request. Yeah. But keep, keep in mind that lately it's,

1359
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:31,599
it's, it's very popular when, when, when new like exploit of, of something is found or new bug is

1360
01:28:31,599 --> 01:28:38,960
found, we need to create a logo. We need to create a special site where the CVE is, is, is, is published.

1361
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:44,799
So this is something that becoming popular to, to, to, to name, to name the attack or the bug.

1362
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:48,000
Hard bleed. Hard bleed.

1363
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,479
There was a changeover. It was a lot of, I mean, our industry got just lifted up and

1364
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:59,919
it becomes suddenly super popular. But yeah, just coming back to that again, our goal,

1365
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:06,239
my goal is to get more hopeful engineers on the security side. So whatever make them to remember

1366
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:12,320
about this security issue. If I, if I tell someone, Hey, this is a server-side request forgery

1367
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,479
bug two months from today, they're going to forget about it. But if I say, Hey, this is a bug that

1368
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:23,760
happened to X, Y, Z component resulted into that. Now having this interesting story, someone after

1369
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:30,080
like a few years ago, he did a, like a workshop came to me and say, Hey, you know, can you just

1370
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:35,760
help me figure these things? Part of the code out. I think this, this may have that GitHub bug.

1371
01:29:37,599 --> 01:29:40,239
What do you mean? GitHub bug? That bug, you know, it was GitHub.

1372
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:45,679
He's talking about the, there was a major vulnerability in GitHub for mass assignment.

1373
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,559
We call it mass assignment, but that kind of tell me, okay, that seems to work.

1374
01:29:50,559 --> 01:29:55,679
That kind of sticks in there in their mind. Yeah. And I think.

1375
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:05,840
Yeah. And like the process of, of you preparing these challenges, like you basically

1376
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:17,440
tailor this to based on the company that is like, um, acquire or services and based on their stack

1377
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:23,440
or so, or based on your past experience of, of you being the code reviewer of, of, uh,

1378
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:29,840
auditing the, the, the, the code and seeing what are the most common mistakes the developers, uh,

1379
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:37,919
do, uh, I'll create a bunch of, uh, like examples or exercises, um, for, for this kind of bugs.

1380
01:30:37,919 --> 01:30:45,520
What is the, how is the process of what is relevant or what, um, developers, uh, are working on.

1381
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,640
So there's a, like a different levels of content given the maturity of that organization. So there

1382
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:58,479
are kind of a group of security bugs that regardless of you writing Python or use Kubernetes,

1383
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:05,280
you need to be aware of them. So we make them tailored toward that organization that, Hey, okay,

1384
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:10,640
these are the things you have to follow. And then the next nice thing is that then the next step is,

1385
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:16,880
uh, because the whole platform has an open SDK, they can even contribute their own type of

1386
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:23,520
problems. And that will be presented in the terms of challenge. So a lot of times it happens that we

1387
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,840
turn a security audit report into a challenge because oftentimes the security report comes in

1388
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:35,840
and then you get few people, you know, dealing with that, fixing the bug and that's it.

1389
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:41,359
When the whole knowledge is gone, what was it? But rather than, we kind of want to make that

1390
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:45,919
more persistent for that organization. Like you have new devs coming in. Hey, do you know what we

1391
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:52,239
had this bug? Well, here's an hour challenge for it. Can you try to, to solve it? And the goal is

1392
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:57,280
to fix it. We are, we simulate the same bug for them and they will kind of try to do it.

1393
01:31:57,919 --> 01:32:06,239
Uh, that's primarily the focuses and, uh, the, the other part is more, uh, running, uh, competition

1394
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:15,280
or game events for them. Like, uh, you want to dedicate time for the team to come in one day and

1395
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,479
start exploring some of the security issues. Can't just, you know, give them a link and they'll

1396
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:26,000
go and do it on your own. But yeah, they probably did that already.

1397
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:37,439
Should we bring the ship to bring that ship in? Yeah. Um, yeah, I was like thinking maybe, maybe

1398
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:46,079
like from how, how, how long have you like done this kind of workshop of dealing with, with

1399
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:53,439
developers? So I'm thinking of, um, like the track record of, of you running the workshops perhaps

1400
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:59,920
is like eight years. Okay. I was running it and, and, and in, in, in this eight years, like you

1401
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:07,040
still see what are the, the top three like major flaws that developers are still like,

1402
01:33:08,079 --> 01:33:13,520
or was it called deadly sins in, in, in software development? What is, what is still,

1403
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:22,880
still out there? And, and I don't know if you, if you, if you track a tracker, um, this at all,

1404
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,680
I mean, it's, you can, you can see in his eyes, all the horrors that he's seen.

1405
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:37,680
I mean, you mean what are the, you're talking about what's still happening? Yeah. Of course.

1406
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:44,880
Like what kind of mistakes are, are, are developers still like making in terms of like,

1407
01:33:45,839 --> 01:33:53,199
like example, like you, you presented the, the, the challenge yesterday. Um, um, for instance,

1408
01:33:53,199 --> 01:34:00,479
the integer overflow that was like, like crucial in, in, in a way of understanding,

1409
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,880
or what, what is still out there?

1410
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:14,479
Well, I can say one of the, well, these quick fixes, like without really understanding what

1411
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:20,000
the root cause of the problem is trying to quickly put some, if a statement around the thing,

1412
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,319
we talked about Heartbleed, I do encourage you to go and look at the patch for the heart.

1413
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,319
And don't be surprised to just see two, if a statement for that security bug. So kind of not

1414
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:36,160
really understanding, Hey, this security bug cannot be treated like other bugs that you fix

1415
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:41,680
in your program. I think that's the thing I still feel is, is missing quite a lot. Like

1416
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,800
you can just put a couple of statements here and there just to patch things.

1417
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:53,280
Um, one of the things that I'm keep talking about, it is all about,

1418
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:59,040
uh, I mean, it's just so many security issues. I don't know which one I pick.

1419
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,000
Name one, name one.

1420
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:13,839
Like, I mean, like some of the, like, some of the things that is re reappearing is like

1421
01:35:13,839 --> 01:35:21,280
this whole concept of like, you know, front-end validation is a, is a joke. You need to do things

1422
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,880
on back end. I thought we solved this problem, but it's kind of coming back and you still see,

1423
01:35:26,959 --> 01:35:32,079
well, these things that just did the validation on front-end and the QA didn't pick it up because

1424
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:37,040
they use the UI to interact with the API. And modern web frameworks in the front-end

1425
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:43,520
are becoming more and more popular and everything. And everything is being done in front-end and,

1426
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:50,479
you know, whatever is in back. A lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, the other thing you see a lot is a lot of

1427
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:56,079
information disclosure that API is just send too much information to the front-end library

1428
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:00,479
because the heavy lifting is done by front-end library. And you don't actually know, actually,

1429
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:04,239
if you observe just the traffic that comes in, it's just too much content.

1430
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,920
I had one case that I could see even the password hashes of people.

1431
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:14,560
And I think that the security bugs, the one that I feel companies need to go after are those ones

1432
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,760
that are in the, their business logic, their semantic ones. They are the ones that get popped

1433
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,800
and get attacked. I think we are kind of relatively good on a low hanging fruit,

1434
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,400
the things that, you know, the scanners can pick up, but the ones that they are really deep inside

1435
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,199
the code and mostly related to the semantic of the code, they are the ones that, yeah,

1436
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,160
it's still, it's just still there. So maybe like to, to end this.

1437
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:48,560
Yeah. I think maybe we need to invite bedroom to four to some Slovenian beers now, probably

1438
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,599
Do you enjoy Slovenian beer?

1439
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:52,319
Which one?

1440
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:53,520
Which one? Well, we explore.

1441
01:36:56,959 --> 01:37:00,640
So maybe like, I don't know, words of wisdom from you.

1442
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,640
Last few words.

1443
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,959
Yeah. What, what would be like in, in terms, in terms of, I don't know, addressing,

1444
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,520
addressing developers, addressing the, the, the management, running the business.

1445
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:26,560
I think it's just early, get security early in, like you get benefit of cost-saving a lot.

1446
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:32,959
The earliest, the better, like, so, and that's why I was really advocating for training because

1447
01:37:32,959 --> 01:37:38,079
that's the earliest stage you can, you can get security in when you are, when that feature

1448
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,839
Inception or like that, a scrum meeting that you have to talk about the feature.

1449
01:37:41,839 --> 01:37:46,319
Actually, that's the time you can start thinking about security really early on, and you can stop

1450
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:51,040
things to, to happen right there before, you know, you're implementing the code and someone

1451
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:55,040
auditor comes in to do it. So I think you get security in as early as possible.

1452
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:02,239
Okay. So wise words. Will you say thank you to everybody or should I?

1453
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:02,880
You should do.

1454
01:38:03,839 --> 01:38:08,959
Well, Pedram, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it. Andraž, thank you for, for this

1455
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:16,719
kind, kind words and leadership in this. And thank you, our listeners of Ugrodje and thanks to

1456
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:22,719
supporters. We have so many that I can name them. So I can say thank you, Jan, Jan, Jan and Marko

1457
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:28,079
for supporting us. And I hope that you guys will give us some feedback, especially given that this

1458
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:32,719
is now in English. And until next time, thank you very much.

1459
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:38,640
Yeah. And we promised to like, maybe do another about security because we saw that security is

1460
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:41,280
quite popular, like in, in, in Discord.

1461
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:45,920
Yeah, there's tons of, yeah, we need to, we need to finish now.

1462
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,560
Thank you everybody. And thanks for sharing.

1463
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,040
Thank you.

1464
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,520
Bye.

1465
01:38:58,079 --> 01:38:59,540
Bye.
