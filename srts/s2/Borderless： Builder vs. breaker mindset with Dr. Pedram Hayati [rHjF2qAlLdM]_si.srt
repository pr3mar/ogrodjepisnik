1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
Well, everybody, welcome to our show.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,120
Welcome to Ogrodje, which should be translated to a framework in English.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,840
Welcome to our very first episode that we're going to try to do in English today.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,360
This is something that we want to experiment with, because so far we were all Slovenian

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,000
podcast.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And primarily, when we were preparing for this talk show, we waited for a while to get

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,119
a speaker that would kind of like transcend our local space and who will be fluent in

8
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,119
English.

9
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,119
And luckily we found such a guest.

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,119
The wrong one.

11
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,119
The wrong one.

12
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:59,240
But we'll discuss that why you're the wrong one.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,759
But equally, like if our English is so bad and we need to fall back, you're also fluent

14
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,760
in Slovenian.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,760
So we can go.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,400
We can also fall back with that.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,959
You took some Slovenian courses, right?

18
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,959
Yes.

19
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,639
So see, you can do bilingual.

20
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:20,639
You can say at least.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
You can say at least hello to everybody.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
Yeah, Juvia.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,040
Here we go.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,559
And what else should we say?

25
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:33,680
You forgot to mention that this episode is part of the borderless.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,160
We should definitely tell people that.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,559
So we're going to prefix all the content that's in English with borderless tag or name, which

29
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:49,919
should hint that we are transcending our borders of our little country, trying to go again,

30
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,879
speak to international guests.

31
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,720
That's the intro for today.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,400
We're going to talk about security, a lot of things around security, but still we'll

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,839
try to be more aware about security that's related to developers, I guess, which is your

34
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,080
specialty.

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,479
And you're going to be the host today, right?

36
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,479
I'll try.

37
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,399
I'll try.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:32,720
So, yeah, this episode, in a way, it's an honor to have you here, Petra, to sort of

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,039
do the connection, how and why.

40
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,039
We met, what?

41
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,520
It was the first B-Sides.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:47,399
And I think you were one of the first submissions, you submitted to the call for papers for B-Sides

43
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:51,759
and I was like sort of a cheering, come on, we have somebody from Australia that's willing

44
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,679
to speak at B-Sides, how come?

45
00:02:55,679 --> 00:03:03,479
And the funny thing is like, it's sort of what we joke about, you mentioned that like

46
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,679
for that request, you said you want to see Kremschnitta.

47
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:13,000
And I was like, there's an Australian guy who wants Kremschnitta also there.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,839
So yeah, long story short, so you're married to Slovene, living in Australia, you're working

49
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:29,559
in the security industry, so information security, maybe a good question, what's sexier, cyber

50
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,160
security or information security?

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
What do you prefer?

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
I'll go with the former.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,399
So information security, so we're like skipping the cyber security?

54
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,399
Cool.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,119
Or whatever you wanted it to be, let's try to find the word.

56
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:58,960
You're now sort of a regular guest on a yearly base coming here and sort of in a way, I could

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:09,320
basically call you a friend, like this friendship whenever you're around, well, in a way, also

58
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,559
like helping the local security community here.

59
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:24,399
So and for example, like yesterday, you had a great sort of a workshop on Python meetup.

60
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:33,600
So that's why like you're working with developers or like this knowledge.

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:42,600
So in cyber security, you got me there, you got me there.

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
He did a poll on Twitter and he's still, I think it was 50-50 or something.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:57,299
Yeah, it was 50-50, it depends who you ask and if you ask chatGTPA, you have like, it's

64
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,179
always referring to cyber security.

65
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:03,880
So it seems that the buzzword, but okay, we'll stick to information security.

66
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,839
So like this short introduction, who are you?

67
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:18,700
Like it's sort of like, because in a way, in the intro, we said like, we're going to

68
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,679
host a great hacker.

69
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:25,000
So are you feeling like this title should suit you?

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,359
Like you feel like you are?

71
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,279
I mean, hacker has different meanings, right?

72
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,579
Like someone who changed something to make it better or someone to break into things,

73
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:34,579
right?

74
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:39,779
Or like explore or like wanting to learn or wanting to figure out how things are working.

75
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,619
I think definitely curiosity is part of it, right?

76
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:49,459
And hacker, I don't know, just kind of, I feel that curiosity more represent the person

77
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:54,940
who like is into security because kind of you, you want to use the functionality for

78
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,559
the purposes that the engineer who built that or the team that have built that maybe

79
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:06,380
never thought about it or finding that beautiful edge case that can make this program do something

80
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,380
differently.

81
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,839
Now, obviously, if it impacts, you know, people's life or, you know, businesses, that become

82
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,119
a security issue.

83
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:20,640
But I think that sense of curiosity, I would say, yeah.

84
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:28,760
One of the biggest critiques of our podcast is that our guests, our listeners sometimes

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,000
need to Google our guests to find out who they are.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,679
So formally, my understanding is that you have a PhD in security and you taught at the

87
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:46,959
university in Australia, I'm not sure if you still teach, but you teach, what did you teach

88
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,320
or like, can you tell us a bit more about that?

89
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
So, I mean, the hardest thing for me is bio, right?

90
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Yeah.

91
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Currently I am also, I'm a lecturer at a university in down under and well, I teach

92
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,920
a master course in, well, I should say cybersecurity related as a technical course.

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:19,420
But apart from that, I also teach to general developers out there in terms of secure programming.

94
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:26,279
This was just a transition I had, like I was more, as you know, more on the other side

95
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:34,040
of the game, looking at, you know, how do we find bugs, how we can find better bugs.

96
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:40,920
And bugs, sorry, well, it's a dev podcast, so I should say bugs, I shouldn't say vulnerabilities

97
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,079
or issues.

98
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:51,000
So yeah, and then kind of, it was a, I would say, yeah, natural transition.

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,880
So like, let's maybe like start in the beginning, how you, you sort of study this or how you

100
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,920
like start in information security?

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,239
How you like, what made you like this?

102
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:14,200
Because you definitely did a transition from offensive security to now defensive security

103
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:23,200
and like teaching developers how to do like secure coding or best practicing in terms

104
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:32,719
of applying security, best practicing in development, but still.

105
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,039
So I mean, the funny thing is, I always say there is no book for security as you have

106
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:44,479
book for PHP and Python and Java, just open it up and you finish it, you're kind of advanced

107
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,479
security guy.

108
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,200
And I think that's the beauty part of it.

109
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,119
I think, again, I want to go back to the sense of security, how is this started?

110
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:57,640
Well, someone tried to hack me back in the days, they tried to, well, we had this newsletter

111
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,239
and for some reason that newsletter got popular.

112
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:09,159
And this person was, had the interest or like two people to, well, get some admin access

113
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,679
on that newsletter.

114
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:19,159
And well, they were, I would say talented enough that they built their own backdoor

115
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,559
or Trojan file.

116
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,599
And they sent it to me and they were asking me, okay, to execute that.

117
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,919
Via mail?

118
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,719
I did execute it.

119
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,400
So spear phishing?

120
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Yeah.

121
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,599
Because they were part of like, well, that community themselves, like, okay.

122
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:43,840
And I'm like, I'm executing this, but it doesn't work.

123
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,200
And after, and then the other guy on the other side of it, there was a chat happening and

124
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,159
he tried with this command, this parameter and none of them works.

125
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,159
And then he keeps asking me to try this and that.

126
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,719
After some point, I just felt there's something fishy going on.

127
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:07,520
And then after a while, the guy actually gave me a call over the phone, like, hey, are you

128
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,200
sure you're running that?

129
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,640
I'm like, yeah.

130
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,200
But and he said, okay, but have you tried this?

131
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah.

132
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Hmm.

133
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,479
So the guys, I started asking, but are you, I'm kind of not sure whether you're telling

134
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,479
me the truth.

135
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:27,119
The guy is telling me, like, why is that?

136
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:31,119
He's like, because do you know what that file is?

137
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:38,599
And then I kind of got some idea, like, yes, I know, I have no idea what it is.

138
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:41,679
And then he's kind of like, you're a good hacker.

139
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,679
What is it?

140
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,679
What does that even mean?

141
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,979
I didn't even say anything.

142
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:48,500
So long story short, the reason that thing didn't work was not because the program was

143
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,140
failing, it was because I was using a university internet and they had proxy.

144
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,140
And the proxy was blocking all the traffic.

145
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,880
And I thought, I know it, I kind of pretend that I'm executing that file, but I was actually

146
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
not doing it.

147
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,099
He was thinking that way.

148
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,099
That kind of got me in.

149
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:14,460
But did he, like, why would you run malicious software?

150
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:22,380
So we're talking, the days of when we even didn't call it malware, we were talking about

151
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,940
viruses and AVs.

152
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
Okay.

153
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
Okay.

154
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
So very early days.

155
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,380
Yeah, kind of early dial-up internet and the old internet connections, which, you know,

156
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,500
you could, we had programs called Trojans, you know, I don't know if some of you remember

157
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,900
sub seven or things like that, you could connect remotely, do stuff, but kind of, that kind

158
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,979
of opens up the idea of that, Hey, there is something more to what you see when you run

159
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:54,500
a program or when you connect to a network.

160
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,820
And then, yeah, there was no resources.

161
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:05,179
There was effectively a couple of like CD-ROM, like CD discs that had some hacking tools

162
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,500
on them.

163
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,859
And then you had some text files from, oh yeah, there was a magazine called Frack Magazine,

164
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:15,820
which exists today.

165
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,539
You want to explain what Frack Magazine is to young audience?

166
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:34,219
So back in the early days, that was like, it was like monthly, monthly.

167
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:41,140
And then when it got like older, it became annually.

168
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,099
But concept was like from like PBSs.

169
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:49,299
So when like people were interesting in-

170
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:52,500
This was online or you had to order via mail or something?

171
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:01,580
They were like also later on the printed copies, but usually the PBSs had like, and they were

172
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:15,340
like short text files with a good description of sort of exploiting or like getting familiar

173
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,460
with, I don't know, technology or concept.

174
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:26,299
And I'm like from programming or how to, I don't know, program some special computers

175
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:34,780
or how the, I don't know, the ATM networks work or how the ISPs communicate.

176
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:45,099
Like they were like, in a way, resourceful manuals, how to get know about some technologies.

177
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,059
So these were like snippets without long explanations?

178
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:52,780
It got into real details.

179
00:13:52,780 --> 00:14:01,340
So they were like, basically back then, the really good sources where you like, understand

180
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,460
how like new technology works.

181
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,820
Yeah, pretty technical.

182
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,340
I think one section which I liked the most was phone hacking.

183
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,979
Because we had a really high bill for our internet connection because I was, not the

184
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,739
internet one, but the phone line.

185
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,700
I was looking for a way that, hey, can we switch to maybe neighbors?

186
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,020
Yeah, those freaking, freaking was like very, very popular and like basically everything

187
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,299
grew out of that kind of community.

188
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,299
Yeah.

189
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:35,020
But there's a big gap between, you know, 2023 and the dial-up, what did you do in between

190
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
as well?

191
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,539
I mean, that's kind of interest growed in, right?

192
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:45,179
And then I think, then we are talking about the days that, you know, web apps start to

193
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,099
emerge in CGI bin folders and there's lots of interesting things there.

194
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,179
And then PHP become a thing, right?

195
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:58,900
And you could almost touch every website and there is like XSS and SQL injection there.

196
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,940
And because they are starting to evolve, we are talking about very early version of MySQL.

197
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:14,780
And again, it was more like understanding how, I think the way I end up finding some,

198
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,140
actually I have some CVs, goes back to 2005.

199
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,820
You kind of, I actually learned it from a programming way, like I actually learned how

200
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,859
you can build a web app.

201
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:30,179
And then how you can communicate the database.

202
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,559
Then when someone said, hey, you know, we have this variable here or PHP just gets everything

203
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,479
in the request and dump it in a query.

204
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,119
Well, ah, okay.

205
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:42,440
So I know that kind of what kind of query will make what.

206
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,919
It was not just like, just go there, put a typical Wikipedia example of a SQL injection

207
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,919
one equals to one.

208
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,599
It was more like you could think a little bit more further than that.

209
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,599
Okay.

210
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,599
This query does that.

211
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,140
So one equals one will not work, but this other one will work.

212
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,039
So I kind of, it was almost more like a, and I should say there were like forums, like

213
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,039
discussion boards of really, um, into TS that they really want to help, like want to like

214
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:17,280
help you when you are trying to find an issue or kind of, you are really close to exploitation.

215
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,719
You could ask question and they will just answer it.

216
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:26,200
I think that kind of engraved in me that this is like really also nice that you also share

217
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
this knowledge.

218
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,719
And I think from beginning was this idea of ethics was always there.

219
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,200
I think it's kind of, kind of, it was not cool that you find this issue and not telling

220
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
vendor about it.

221
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,840
Uh, but at the time, you know, we are not talking about, you know, these days, majority

222
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,280
of the good businesses, they have these, uh, well, they, they understand there could be

223
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,640
a time someone report a security issue to them.

224
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,840
And there's normally, there is a unwritten rule of responsible disclosure policy.

225
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,119
But back in, uh, back in those days, maybe it wasn't, it was not that clear.

226
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,479
And normally when you report a security bug, often you want some attribution value.

227
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:16,959
I remember when we were reporting some security bugs to, to some vendors, we're like, okay,

228
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,640
the only thing we want from you is just mention my name in your next newsletter.

229
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I go there.

230
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
I do it.

231
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Yeah.

232
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Yeah.

233
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Okay.

234
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Okay.

235
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
And you, you started as a, as a, I don't know, researcher or somebody who was like, uh,

236
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:37,439
chasing, chasing those, those back exploring on their own or how, how you like, uh, well,

237
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:40,599
I mean, it actually started first by like building networks.

238
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,359
I remember like the first thing you do, you know, when I bring up a windows NT and you

239
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,839
know, set up a network and then you move to Linux, you're like, huh, it's not that easy.

240
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,599
Even just bringing up a DHCP server needs that much config file and there is no sample

241
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,599
file out there.

242
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,599
Like just Google for it.

243
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:59,560
So you need to figure out what each configuration does.

244
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,920
I think they started the learning, really the, the foundations, learning really what's

245
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:12,000
how things work from physical layer all the way up to application layer.

246
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,560
And kind of that's, that's how I feel is, and the more you know about how things work,

247
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,280
the more you can kind of challenge these, these assumptions we have to between different

248
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,079
layers, which I always mention it, like the more, you know, how things will translate

249
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:35,239
into, well, in a different layer of the network, the more you can find that, okay.

250
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:40,160
Like if these thing doesn't have this specific format, well, guess what?

251
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,560
It could result into a security bar.

252
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,479
I think, I don't think there's any shortcut there to know it.

253
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:57,079
So this is like, basically through this learning experience, exploring like new technology,

254
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:04,239
like you mentioned Linux and so on, you basically reach, like migrate to, to, to information

255
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:13,280
security and like getting all, all that knowledge gives, gave you the, the foundations on, on,

256
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
on top.

257
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,160
You could like, I don't know, have a career in, in, in information security.

258
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,199
Yeah, exactly.

259
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:29,400
I actually, when I, when I was, when I graduated from my, my doctoral degree, I actually didn't

260
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,920
know there is even a job exists that they pay you to find security box.

261
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,680
Like I didn't even know there is such a thing even exists because always it was a hobby.

262
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,160
It was always the sysadmin type guy that maybe care about what, how long the password

263
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
should be.

264
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,800
And then maybe put some restriction there or to harden their SSH endpoint.

265
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,800
It wasn't really a, a thing that you could feel, well, someone really would be interested

266
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,719
that you go and ethically review their system and they will pay for it.

267
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:08,040
I remember I was actually looking for more like a research engineering type positions.

268
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,959
I actually came across all of a sudden with this position that talks about, are you familiar

269
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,920
with your application security issues?

270
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,800
Do you have any experience finding security was on the wall?

271
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:27,040
It seems like interesting and yeah, and, and working there as a effectively as a consultant,

272
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,239
a penetration tester.

273
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:34,719
And that's, yeah, getting familiar with the whole story of, you know, yeah, okay.

274
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,000
Nowadays you need to do vulnerability scan.

275
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,239
Then you, you report that to a customer, you need to explain, explain that.

276
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,040
And yeah, yeah, yeah.

277
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Started there.

278
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Yeah.

279
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:53,680
But like with, with like in, in, in this process, like you could, we could already say that

280
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,959
you are a veteran in, in, in, in the field.

281
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:07,000
And like you said, the, the basically jobs in information security back then were like

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,719
not known or like not like wanted that, that much.

283
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:21,760
But now like you have kids finishing college that specialized in, in, in security.

284
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,560
And like you have this new generation of, of, of, of people already very eager to, to

285
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,400
work in, in, in information security field.

286
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:40,319
And maybe you can like share like how you see this new generation of, of, of, you know,

287
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,880
I don't not necessarily agree with the, whether the colleagues, colleges, or even universities

288
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,000
produce skilled people, but definitely eagerness, not eagerness was there also back then, like

289
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:58,319
maybe it was not in a sense of web application hacking or, or cloud hacking, but it was also,

290
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,359
if you remember, we had the whole area of cracking, cracking files, cracking games and

291
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,359
all these things.

292
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,680
And the whole concept of reverse engineering a game to figure out how it works, or you

293
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,479
can just, you know, it's, I remember we were trying to crack the, there was old Prince

294
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:20,479
of Persia type game, or how can I jump to last level?

295
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:25,920
And that was my exposure to Hex editor and the things that, Oh, things behind the scene

296
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
looks like Hex.

297
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
And I thought actually Hex is what machine will understand.

298
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,060
And then I realized, no, actually, no, there is something more layer behind it.

299
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,199
It was more, more those things.

300
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:42,439
So even those days, there were people who were looking to do this thing, viruses and

301
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:47,959
things were, was the area that a lot of people wanted to figure, figure things out.

302
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:56,560
But you know, that there are things can go wrong with the system, but, and I don't necessarily

303
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,479
know if there was any college degree, you know, doing it, but okay, coming back to what

304
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,479
was the question?

305
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,479
They were the new generation.

306
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,479
Yeah.

307
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,479
The new generation.

308
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:11,040
So basically you, from your transition on how you like ended up in, in, in, in this

309
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,439
field or gain this kind of expertise.

310
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:22,040
We can like definitely see the new generation, like in, in a way it's sexy to work in information

311
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,839
security or, or work as a, as a penetration tester or a security researcher.

312
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:35,699
But from, from my perspective, what I see is like this, this young generation or people

313
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:41,380
not having enough knowledge, fundamental knowledge of understanding, I don't know

314
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:47,500
how a TCP IP networking works or understanding how operation system works.

315
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:53,839
And they just want to like do the sexy stuff in terms of, of hacking and breaking stuff,

316
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:59,880
but not really understanding what are they like breaking and what is like in the layers

317
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,979
below running and why things are working that way.

318
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:06,780
And the things that takes time, the things that you need to spend more time on.

319
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,380
But I'm going to challenge you guys now.

320
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,500
So this could turn into like old people nagging, nagging about the younger generation, right?

321
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,819
But what if, what if, um, the, the layers that you guys mentioned so far have been around

322
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:31,900
so long that they are so mature and so, so protected and so, you know, all the bugs have

323
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,339
been found and they're so stable that those layers are not with flaws.

324
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:40,540
So today they're coming from very different angle.

325
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,140
They are, they're approaching from top down.

326
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Right.

327
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,780
So perhaps then in that case, you need a different kind of skills, which is a good news to hear,

328
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,780
right?

329
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,579
So that was, we haven't based our time, just still fixing the IP port, well, having said

330
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,619
that there was just a vulnerability identified in.

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,400
in implementation of one of the Linux distro just recently.

332
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Ping.

333
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,800
Ping ICMP protocol right now, 2023, right?

334
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,360
So it's not that all these layers are so very secure.

335
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,160
I mean, you shouldn't ask me for that.

336
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,320
But definitely there has been a huge improvement, right?

337
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,799
In all those layers, right?

338
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,040
And kind of you assume that, you know,

339
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,600
one of the best things, for example,

340
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
like these days you always assume the traffic

341
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,599
that comes from your browser to your API is secure.

342
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,799
It's on a secure channel.

343
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,160
You never think twice, but you go back some years ago,

344
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,480
that was not the case.

345
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,279
Actually, some of the findings that you may find

346
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,000
in the Pentest report was always about SSL.

347
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh, you're not using this certificate.

348
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,360
But kind of, sort of, maybe,

349
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,240
I don't want to give a percentage,

350
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,560
but that is kind of gone, which you're happy.

351
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
So kind of, we don't really need to report

352
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,720
on those sort of things.

353
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,439
We have definitely improvement

354
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,519
on some front-end frameworks, right?

355
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,000
Like some of the security issues

356
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,320
are really hard to get introduced,

357
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
which again, we're glad to see that.

358
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,559
So it's kind of by default,

359
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,160
some of these frameworks enforce some security controls

360
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,959
that if you really want to do something very bad,

361
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,919
there's like a function you can,

362
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,879
they don't limit you,

363
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,599
but the function is called dangerously something.

364
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,440
Yeah.

365
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,000
Something kind of gives you a hint.

366
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,959
You're doing something very fishy.

367
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,360
Which is great, but back in the days,

368
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,639
well, in JavaScript, you have eval.

369
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,120
Is eval dangerous or not?

370
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,959
Yeah.

371
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,120
I think eval should be renamed to something.

372
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,519
Don't call this function ever parameter.

373
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,239
So definitely was an improvement.

374
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,199
But again, coming back to that,

375
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:52,360
I feel those foundations are necessary.

376
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,599
If you don't know how say computer works,

377
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,400
what processes, how,

378
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,720
and then you want to quickly jump in,

379
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
like let's say, learning about Docker security,

380
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
container security,

381
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,519
but behind the scene is a process.

382
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,919
Behind the scene is a C group.

383
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,639
Behind the scene is a name space, right?

384
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:12,360
It's nothing different,

385
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,039
but without that foundation of like, let's say,

386
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm not saying you need to know the Linux kernel,

387
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,240
but without that foundation that what are these are,

388
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,360
just jumping in,

389
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,960
running in a scanner,

390
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,800
trying to find a security bug in a container,

391
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,039
not gonna take you far.

392
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,600
If you want to be a thinker in this area,

393
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,199
perhaps one of the really good quotes

394
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,679
I can mention here from one professor in Australia,

395
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,080
he said that in our industry,

396
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
we have so many technicians in security,

397
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,720
we just need more engineers,

398
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,839
like people who can come and think.

399
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,679
And to be, I feel to be that engineer,

400
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,600
you really need to understand how things work.

401
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,839
What is like, in your view,

402
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,160
like a big difference between, I don't know,

403
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,479
I will use the term hacker here,

404
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,440
but what's the big difference between a hacker

405
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,679
and senior software engineer?

406
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,160
Is there even a big difference?

407
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,759
And in what way can you like elaborate on this a bit?

408
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,160
So I find like engineers in general

409
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,559
more have this builder mindset.

410
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,880
The mindset of getting things working,

411
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,679
getting things efficient,

412
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,759
getting, get the, you know,

413
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,800
solve that defined problem.

414
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,440
But like someone who is on,

415
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,279
let's say in a hacker or security side

416
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,600
is more like a breaker mindset.

417
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,199
I don't know, I often make this example,

418
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,199
like to build a bridge,

419
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,240
it takes some skillset,

420
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,919
but to blow up that bridge in a controlled manner,

421
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,800
so it doesn't touch the buildings around,

422
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,639
that is different set of skillset.

423
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:50,320
Whereas the original builder may not necessarily have it.

424
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:54,399
I actually found this through the workshops that I ran,

425
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,360
that the person,

426
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,399
or some of students I had back in the days

427
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,600
that you find a super talented guy,

428
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,119
he seems to really good in programming,

429
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,479
you know, he doesn't even need any direction.

430
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,520
But I really think,

431
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,199
oh, that person should be great for, you know,

432
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,799
thinking about all these edge cases that,

433
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,720
rare cases that can happen to a software

434
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,040
that can result into a security issue,

435
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,079
but he's just not interested.

436
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,760
They're like, they don't find it attractive.

437
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,119
They don't find it cool.

438
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,359
They actually like to build things.

439
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,200
Yeah.

440
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,399
And it's, that makes sense.

441
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,519
And like, before jumping to the next section,

442
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,279
in this process, like in the beginning you said,

443
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,480
and that's also my experience,

444
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,480
like this InfoSec community worldwide is pretty open.

445
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,279
It's pretty like this knowledge sharing is always there.

446
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,959
Like in a way, like the open source community,

447
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:04,040
but even more like the way I see it,

448
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,440
even more,

449
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,359
friendly in a way.

450
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,359
And you're also the father of SecTalks.

451
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,000
You're the founder, right?

452
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,640
Father, father, founder, father figure.

453
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,320
And maybe you should like explain,

454
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,480
because basically you build sort of a community in,

455
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,920
let's call it your backyard and then like outgrow

456
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,399
the community, right?

457
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:32,239
Yeah.

458
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,640
Let's call it your backyard and then like outgrow

459
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,000
this community to copy paste it in different,

460
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,279
around Australia and abroad.

461
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,799
What is SecTalks about?

462
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,720
I think it has started with the whole thing that

463
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
you like to visit like-minded people in the industry.

464
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,359
And, you know, security,

465
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,079
although maybe it's a big topic now,

466
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,239
it doesn't have, I don't feel it even have

467
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:04,239
such a large community of people comparing with perhaps

468
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,480
software development community to some extent.

469
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,119
So it was always good to just, you know, sit around

470
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,359
and just given the nature of security,

471
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,119
there are things that people may not necessarily talk

472
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:19,799
about it online, but maybe in a setting, you know,

473
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,920
in some venue, they may actually talk about it.

474
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,920
And you may hear very interesting stories.

475
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:31,239
So I think, again, that was, again, a natural thing.

476
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,279
You kind of feel, oh, I actually like to visit.

477
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,320
At the time I was in Perth, in Western Australia,

478
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,600
there was some ad hoc events happening there.

479
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,279
And after a while, one of those events that we had,

480
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,559
that like was running for every month,

481
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,200
it suddenly stopped.

482
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,239
And then we just felt this void of, oh, actually,

483
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:55,720
you know, I want to really meet someone.

484
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,079
And then I was also working for a security consulting

485
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,000
business at the time.

486
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
And then I was like, hey, what if, you know,

487
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,959
we just try to run it here, ask around,

488
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,559
and that primarily started.

489
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,559
But the things I think we started from beginning,

490
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,119
I tried to advocate it was this whole idea

491
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,559
of the no bullshit.

492
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,559
Like, you know, you come here, more than welcome.

493
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,799
We would love to talk to you.

494
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,079
You can even give a talk, but keep the bullshit.

495
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,920
But this is sort of like, I would say,

496
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,920
we, the security people, we really don't want to hear

497
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,880
and see bullshit.

498
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,799
Because basically each security community,

499
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,799
or it's like this kind of local community going on,

500
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,600
like.

501
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,399
But like, can we be a bit more specific?

502
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,559
What do you mean, bullshit?

503
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,519
You mean, you don't want to hear, I don't know,

504
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,519
marketing pitches, like, you want to talk about,

505
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,239
I don't know, exploits, vulnerabilities,

506
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,440
how to protect your systems from it.

507
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,399
You want to have, you know, first raw access

508
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,399
to this kind of data.

509
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,160
Yeah, but to be hardcore technical.

510
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,880
To not like presenting the upper layer,

511
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,519
how this, what you built or what you're going to present

512
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,320
is off, is great and so on,

513
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,239
without discussing what is running above.

514
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,359
Yeah, exactly.

515
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,359
It's just, I think you look at when you're long enough

516
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
in security, you know, things are not secure.

517
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:53,520
Yeah.

518
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,640
And that's the reality of it.

519
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,599
You can't really say, yeah, even claim.

520
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,599
And we have, there are interesting stories

521
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,039
that CEO is going out and claiming such and such

522
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,520
database engine is secure.

523
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,640
And then there is a book is now written for that,

524
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,679
how to hack that database engine out there.

525
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,760
So you kind of, you see these things

526
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,039
and also as like a geek or a technical guy,

527
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,359
you know how things work and you know, okay,

528
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:19,159
under these condition and that certain assumptions,

529
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,440
yeah, maybe that thing is a secure,

530
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,520
but in reality it's not.

531
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,960
And you don't want to go somewhere,

532
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,640
just hear someone talking about that.

533
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,159
It's kind of want to attract those people

534
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,359
who have a genuine interest in the field,

535
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,640
not necessarily are opportunistic that they think,

536
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,760
well, I would say perhaps the time that

537
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,799
this whole thing started was not so much a big topic,

538
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:43,320
was more like, well, you just get together, have a chat.

539
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,599
So kind of trying to attract those, more those guys.

540
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,960
And the other thing I felt was important

541
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,840
is that this egoistic nature of,

542
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,719
when you feel you're a hacker or a security guy,

543
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,719
you feel you're so special that because, you know,

544
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:09,440
you find something that perhaps nobody in that team

545
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,119
would ever discover that.

546
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,599
And kind of, you have this feeling of, okay, all right.

547
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,200
So, you know, I'm very important,

548
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,880
but kind of, I actually didn't like it either.

549
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,159
I'm like, if you are a great hacker, you actually,

550
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,080
can you explain it to someone who doesn't have any clue?

551
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,919
Well, then that means you're a really good hacker.

552
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,760
I can sit here and talk about the, everything is broken.

553
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,719
This wifi is broken and that network is broken,

554
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,280
but that doesn't give-

555
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,520
It's not useful inside.

556
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,719
We know that it's already broken, yeah.

557
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,760
Yeah, just come and talk about it, yeah.

558
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,679
Okay.

559
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,039
May I ask this question?

560
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:47,880
Yeah, sure.

561
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,840
You come up as a really humble in this conversation,

562
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,359
but there is a SecTalks around the world.

563
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,320
There's around 10,000 members in this community

564
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,679
or something like that.

565
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:03,599
So in all major cities, these SecTalk events

566
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,960
appear on a monthly basis, if I understand correctly.

567
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,159
So audience out there, if you're interested,

568
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,640
make sure you find it out.

569
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
We'll put some links there, right?

570
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,919
Can I do that?

571
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:16,799
Yeah, but it's interesting

572
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,479
because this is one of those meetups

573
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,559
that it's not recorded, if I understand correctly.

574
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,159
Yeah, but there were some recorded meetups during COVID,

575
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,000
but then-

576
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,320
And in general, it's true that-

577
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,840
Generally, yeah, in person.

578
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,359
You know, you wanna meet people in 3D, you know,

579
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,719
you don't want-

580
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,280
And like, to some extent,

581
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,280
like those meetups also include capture the flag?

582
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,679
Maybe.

583
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,520
Yeah, so-

584
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,760
Maybe it's like for the audience to explain what this-

585
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,919
So you know, Perth is a city in Australia,

586
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,719
which, I mean, 1.4 million,

587
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,000
but it may fill that audit,

588
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,200
so there's a lot of people there.

589
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,679
But at the time, any of you who are a meetup organizer,

590
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,159
you know that it's really hard to find good content.

591
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,400
So the idea, and yeah, we play a game in security,

592
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,799
which I always advocate to anyone

593
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,000
who wants to start security,

594
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,760
to do it is capture the flag,

595
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,960
which the goal is, you know,

596
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,960
you hack into this simulated or virtual environment

597
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,479
to find a flag.

598
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,440
And a lot of people naturally has interest in that.

599
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,880
But one of the things you,

600
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,239
I mean, I often found was missing is that,

601
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:29,000
you know, these CTFs typically run as part of a conference

602
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,159
and you have lead hackers, you know,

603
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,159
they go and break things and find the flags

604
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,479
and get the trophy.

605
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:39,119
But you don't really hear that how they have done it,

606
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,159
like how they have achieved it,

607
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,640
which I felt that was a knowledge missing.

608
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,919
But guess what?

609
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:47,239
It was like one stone, two birds.

610
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,400
I was like, okay, how about we run a CTF,

611
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,440
we limit it only to 60 minutes,

612
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,520
and then let the people doing it on the day.

613
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,239
And then in the next session,

614
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,440
because it's very hard to find a good speaker,

615
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,239
the person who hacked it can come and talk about it.

616
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,080
And the kind of,

617
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,479
we kind of have this filler of the events happening.

618
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,719
That worked well for,

619
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,280
especially for the smaller communities we had.

620
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,880
So it's like a good starter.

621
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,080
And hopefully we don't end up, you know,

622
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,200
getting any vendor talks and things to do, it's crippling.

623
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,200
But do you think like nowadays the capture the flag contest

624
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,919
or like online hacking the boxes

625
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:30,919
or became more popular than like, I don't know,

626
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,799
10 years ago, 15 years ago?

627
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:33,640
Yeah, definitely.

628
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,960
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

629
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,520
It's not, my understanding is that

630
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,760
if this used to be like part of the conferences

631
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
organized to challenge people,

632
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,840
now it's becoming very competitive

633
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,960
and really big thing across the globe.

634
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,599
People are really learning

635
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,359
and preparing just for these things.

636
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,119
So as we discussed earlier,

637
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,599
we said that you need to learn these layers

638
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,200
to build your stack and learn all the things.

639
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,559
People are now optimizing for just these games,

640
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,919
if I understand correctly, right?

641
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:07,840
So they probably learn all the tricks

642
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,960
that are possible in these timeframes

643
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,320
or is there like elements

644
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,960
that you need to reinvent some new mechanics or?

645
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,919
Yeah, the way I saw like the good teams,

646
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,440
like they have their own tooling.

647
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,760
They prepared like how to like had some advantage

648
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:28,400
on how to compete.

649
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,200
Prior to coming to these challenges.

650
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,320
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,320
And a lot of actually some of the good hacking tooling

652
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,080
or security testing tool actually came out

653
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,960
of some of these CTFs,

654
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,719
specifically one quite interesting security issue,

655
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,599
which is known as severed site template injection or SSTI.

656
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,599
This bug was the demonstration of how bad this bug can get

657
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,599
or how this vulnerability can get.

658
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,799
So that was through one of the,

659
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:06,760
some of the CTFs and the write up one of these players had

660
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,799
and the kind of that expanded that,

661
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:11,640
whoa, this thing can go really seriously bad.

662
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,119
So, and then yeah, publishing those tools

663
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,159
and as Andrei said,

664
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,520
some of them actually have the Python libraries

665
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,239
even for how to do different things so quickly.

666
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,719
Can you give us a bit more example

667
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,440
on what's in this toolbox that they use?

668
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:38,799
I mean, let me rephrase the question.

669
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,400
Can you give us example of these challenges?

670
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,679
Like what would be, for example,

671
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,039
examples of a good assignment that will be part

672
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,400
of a capture the flag challenge?

673
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,359
Well, those are like the default ones of stenography,

674
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:57,840
like hiding the flag inside some kind of image.

675
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Then like very known are like also the PCAP.

676
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,599
So snapshot of network traffic and then inside like that,

677
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,520
there's a flag.

678
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,479
What else?

679
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:16,320
I mean, reverse engineering.

680
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,960
So you have the binary file and you need to figure out

681
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,359
what does that do?

682
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:23,840
I mean, you have a web application type security issues

683
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,119
that the goal is to hack into that web app

684
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,239
or web API and then exploit it.

685
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,960
And eventually you get perhaps a root access there

686
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,840
and you can read the text file, which is a flag there.

687
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,799
It's very-

688
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:42,400
Are these things like chained together

689
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,080
or is this like hacking to this webpage,

690
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,919
get the flag and then move to the next challenge?

691
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,760
Or do you have to like, do you change them together?

692
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Like get one flag here and then do something else

693
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,960
or is this, it really depends on-

694
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,280
I'd say it depends, but usually they're not chained.

695
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,159
Like basically you finish the puzzle

696
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,160
or solve the challenge, the new challenge opens.

697
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,280
It really depends.

698
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,920
Is there any help or any hints or anything like that?

699
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,439
Yeah, it's a penalty points for hints as well.

700
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,280
Penalty.

701
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,319
Penalty points so you get for soften to reveal the hint.

702
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,880
Now whether the quality of that hint will be good or not.

703
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,560
That's another topic, but you get some,

704
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,959
it's more like a competition.

705
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,719
So kind of you learn through the competition

706
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,000
and often actually it works.

707
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like I, back in the days, we built some CTF challenges

708
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,160
for some international conferences.

709
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,160
And I know for the fact that one of that very good CTF team

710
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:49,439
that they didn't touch cryptography type challenges.

711
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:52,880
They had no idea about different encryption

712
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,680
or decryption type algorithms,

713
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,800
but throughout that CTF period for that conference,

714
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,920
which normally runs two to three days,

715
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,239
they actually went and start learning about it,

716
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:07,439
reading articles and eventually solve that challenge,

717
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:10,040
which the guy was telling me that in a normal cases,

718
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,520
I wouldn't bother even to read about this.

719
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Kind of, I was like, okay,

720
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,400
but now because of this sense of competition

721
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
and like actually now I know,

722
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,599
like there's a lot of things I can go and check out for it.

723
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,599
And you think like being good at CTFs,

724
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,880
like sort of a good starting point in security career or?

725
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,040
I think you can immediately test

726
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,439
or compare your skillset to others.

727
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,839
It's very hands-on like interactive.

728
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:47,760
So if you talk about like the life cycle

729
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,119
of like a security issue,

730
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,040
I mean, the first thing is you need

731
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,479
to find the security issue, finding a vulnerability.

732
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:58,640
Okay, there are some perhaps techniques

733
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,599
you can follow to find that,

734
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,560
but then it comes the exploitation phase,

735
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,640
which I typically call it is at the most closer than art

736
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,560
because it depends,

737
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,479
like often when you are engaged by a customer

738
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,640
to do a security assessment,

739
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,680
you may find an interesting security issue,

740
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,560
but just to turn that and prove to them

741
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,719
that this is really bad,

742
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,640
it may take you the rest of the duration of the engagement

743
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,119
just to demonstrate one security issue

744
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,359
has a really major impact on the environment.

745
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:36,400
So I think someone who,

746
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,439
I feel when you go through that exploitation phase,

747
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,560
you actually learn quite a lot

748
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,160
and you really understand a lot of quirks.

749
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,160
Like when you are a security, well, security researcher,

750
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,400
we don't have the luxury of having a debugger

751
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,560
as like a software engineers

752
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,160
that you can just attach to the program,

753
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,239
figure out what's happened.

754
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:59,800
Like there is like nothing like that.

755
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,000
You kind of, a lot of times,

756
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,079
yeah, it's a lot of trial and error.

757
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,760
A lot of times there's a lack of tooling

758
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,959
even to interface with something.

759
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:11,719
So it's a lot of complexity involved in there.

760
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:12,560
So I think.

761
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,640
But like experience from like a sec docs

762
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,800
we run in Ljubljana,

763
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:25,400
like that few CTFs that we had,

764
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:31,040
it was interesting that like on the guys

765
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,359
who were leading on like highest on the scoreboard

766
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:36,439
were actually developers.

767
00:45:36,439 --> 00:45:39,640
So not people like dealing with security

768
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,040
or solving the CTFs.

769
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,199
There were like few guys that like really,

770
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:49,040
when the problem is presented

771
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,920
or the puzzle that was presented,

772
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,119
they start like really thinking outside of the box

773
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,439
because all other, let's say security people

774
00:45:57,439 --> 00:46:00,439
that working security were relying on tools,

775
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,599
relying on, okay,

776
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,680
which tool should I use to extract something out

777
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,000
in compared to the developer who was thinking,

778
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,880
okay, what am I seeing here?

779
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,000
How can I, so.

780
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,839
Exactly.

781
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
There have been so many cases like that,

782
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,239
that people who are completely new,

783
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,319
let's say to security,

784
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,719
they come to SecDocs

785
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,680
and then they are taught in a ladder work.

786
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,880
The other things like sometimes

787
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,040
we had actually a specific case in Sydney

788
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,199
that one of the top players a few years ago,

789
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,400
he actually didn't even know about all these toolings

790
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,239
that is available,

791
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,280
like some of these Python libraries that are available

792
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,280
just to make the reversing that super easy.

793
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,079
He was just building everything,

794
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,040
thinking about it, reasoning about it.

795
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,359
Me, I'm like that in these cases.

796
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,000
When he was presenting that

797
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,199
and then these like,

798
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:55,839
there's a lot of also students coming in.

799
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,400
They are looking at this kind of, wow,

800
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,760
like the algorithm that he built, for example,

801
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
to prove that, I don't know, to find the,

802
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,199
to crack the hash.

803
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:04,560
They're like, and they were telling him

804
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,640
after the talk that, hey, you know,

805
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,079
you just make a call to this library

806
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:08,920
that exactly.

807
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,760
Yeah, if you don't know what's in the toolbox,

808
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,680
you can use it, yeah, right.

809
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,880
Yeah, but on the other side,

810
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,239
like you also get,

811
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,199
like usually there are multiple ways

812
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,079
how to solve the puzzle.

813
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:27,640
And like it was a thing in Unix world,

814
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,479
like there are many ways to skin a cat,

815
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,280
like whoever won present the solution,

816
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,439
like then you can like start comparing

817
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,439
whether you were thinking the same

818
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:44,959
or using the same methods or different.

819
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:46,000
So, yeah.

820
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,359
My observation of one of these psych talks

821
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,160
was like, it was very interesting

822
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,880
because I like, I saw a couple of guys

823
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,839
that were programmers

824
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,719
because there is no like limit

825
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:58,920
what tools you can use or not use.

826
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:01,439
Somebody is writing something in Perl.

827
00:48:01,439 --> 00:48:02,439
Somebody just said,

828
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:04,560
I'm just gonna throw this code

829
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,439
that needs to be encrypted or decrypted

830
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:09,119
into spreadsheets or bash.

831
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,000
It doesn't really matter.

832
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,400
It's just whatever tools you use.

833
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,119
So that's very interesting.

834
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:17,040
I just remember there's an interesting story

835
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,760
how you two met, right?

836
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,599
Yeah.

837
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,760
You remember?

838
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,000
I caused more problems.

839
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:24,959
Yeah.

840
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,000
I just remember today and said to Otto

841
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,280
that it's funny because I think it's worth saying

842
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,319
how you two-

843
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:36,719
Obviously it's your fault, right?

844
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:37,560
So-

845
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,400
Yeah.

846
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,959
I mean, it's your fault for solving the challenge

847
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,599
and revealing the secret.

848
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,160
I don't remember everything,

849
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,920
but I know that, so we have the Slack

850
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,680
and you just dropped in the page

851
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,199
from Pedram's website.

852
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,599
And there's like a capture the flag

853
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,920
kind of a thing on his-

854
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,520
No, he was like hiring-

855
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,400
I didn't read that.

856
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,599
I just saw it's a capture the flag,

857
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,800
something with Docker.

858
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,319
So you didn't know what was it?

859
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,640
I didn't know.

860
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,880
There was just like this page

861
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,280
and Loki posted it and I was like,

862
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,880
okay, I'm gonna look, what's that?

863
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,479
Just play with him because it was,

864
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:21,119
I think it was dependent on Python.

865
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,439
I just wanna like play with it

866
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:25,119
so that I can like show off Python from him

867
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,359
because I know he tries to avoid programming

868
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,439
as much as possible.

869
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,119
And yeah, there was something with the Docker container.

870
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:35,719
I can't remember what it was,

871
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:38,000
but yeah, it had some cipher in there

872
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,839
and some environment keys.

873
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,119
And I just like, like you said,

874
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,800
I looked into how to blow up this bridge.

875
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,800
Yeah, and then you wrote a blog post on your site.

876
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

877
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:55,119
I wrote like, I didn't, yeah.

878
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:55,959
That's like-

879
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,800
And that's when you contacted him.

880
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,640
Yeah, that's yeah.

881
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,760
Hey, whatever here is a writer, I'm like-

882
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,800
Did you know what you saw? That was our career entrance.

883
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:12,760
Yeah, because what I did is like, when I was doing this, I wanted to just have a document

884
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,080
describing all the steps that I did.

885
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,040
So I wrote down everything and I was like, I needed something for my blog at the time.

886
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,719
I was like, okay, I'm going to write this down, right?

887
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,719
And then in the end, the last step was like, send email and then it was like, your email

888
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,320
and send the email and send the blog post attached to it.

889
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,560
And that was stupid and in hindsight, yeah, I know, I'm sorry for that.

890
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
I think I apologized.

891
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Why didn't you apologize?

892
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Then you put it public.

893
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,560
Yeah.

894
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,360
I put it public, yeah, that was a shitty thing to do.

895
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,400
And perhaps that could be a nice segue into discussion about hacking and ethics probably

896
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,400
and what you said, what's the term, disclosure.

897
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Full disclosure.

898
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,560
Full disclosure, 90 days and everything, yeah.

899
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:03,119
It just made it harder for other people to apply because that's the thing, you can't

900
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,239
necessarily stop people to write, write up about your challenges, right?

901
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:09,440
But we'll make a better challenge, the next challenge.

902
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,919
So Jan, you hope that they will read that right up.

903
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:14,239
Well, I didn't get, I didn't get the job.

904
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,000
So the next guy must probably be better than I am.

905
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,639
For me, like it was interesting because it was a job ad basically.

906
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:32,919
And I saw this as a very creative job ad because you need to like solve the puzzle to actually

907
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:36,400
know what, like how to contact you.

908
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,199
Well, you needed to know a lot of stuff.

909
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:43,360
You needed to know, of course, you needed to know what is Caesar cipher, I think it

910
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:49,519
was there, environment variables, Docker, missing things, Python code.

911
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:57,360
There was a lot of these very things that I saw in my professional career, how these

912
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,959
things work.

913
00:51:58,959 --> 00:51:59,959
And yeah.

914
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:06,800
So I imagine in your company, you're looking for people that have some solid engineering

915
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:15,440
background, but they also like are curious to extreme or something like, yeah.

916
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:24,600
Like maybe we could like cut here and enjoy the glass of water, I'll do commercials.

917
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,399
So Otto will now present the commercials.

918
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:34,160
So if you guys enjoy this podcast and if you want to keep enjoying it and it will really

919
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:41,800
help us if you join us and support us, there's a link below in the footnotes.

920
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,639
So yeah, join our Patreon supporters and it will mean a lot to us and we will be able

921
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:48,399
to make this wonderful content.

922
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:52,440
Oh, here you go.

923
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,440
So let's start the next section.

924
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,080
So what I wanted to talk about is application security.

925
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:13,520
So in terms of you now being on this defensive side where you educate developers and give

926
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:26,880
them this knowledge of how to apply security in, let's call it a life cycle of development

927
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,919
life cycle.

928
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:39,199
And where to start for application security from developer's perspective.

929
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:47,000
May I like kind of like expand his question, like software development cycle means that

930
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,399
there are different phases in the development of software.

931
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:54,320
So you have planning, designing, implementation, testing, deployment, and then some maintenance,

932
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
right?

933
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,399
You have all these steps.

934
00:53:56,919 --> 00:54:01,880
And traditionally what companies did is like they went through all these steps, released

935
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,520
the product, and then probably perhaps also hired some pen tester because company that

936
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,399
was trying to buy it or something wanted some audited or something like that.

937
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:17,279
But that's not how things should be done if I understand correctly.

938
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:20,399
And is that like a good intro to this section?

939
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:23,399
I'm prepared to apply it on all of this.

940
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:24,399
Yeah.

941
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:25,399
The earlier is better.

942
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:26,399
Yeah.

943
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:29,679
More like you can't really, it's a non-functional requirement, right?

944
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:36,160
This is one of those that can't really have a face for it, but it's kind of applies everywhere.

945
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:43,920
I mean, I'm trying to think about the question, like, is it more, you know, I think for one

946
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,440
of the things I found out after working with, I mean, one of the reasons I actually started

947
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:55,079
working more on a defensive side was more, was the problems that I always have this interest

948
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:57,959
that find the root cause where the issue really is.

949
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:03,399
Like, you know, you do code audit, secure code audit, and you do penetration testing

950
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:11,200
and you can see a trend of security issues that just keep appearing, keep appearing.

951
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,040
And one approach to that is like, yeah, they don't understand that there's more approach

952
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,079
of us versus them.

953
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:22,959
Like, you know, they're just, I don't know, dark dumb, these guys, they don't give a shit

954
00:55:22,959 --> 00:55:23,959
about security.

955
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:24,959
Okay.

956
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:25,959
Whatever.

957
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:29,079
And I'm going to just, you know, just do the same thing.

958
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:32,399
But the other approach for me, which was more interesting was like, why?

959
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:38,640
Like why this, because that security issue that normally you find in a environment or

960
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:47,119
a system, it's a, is an edge case that, well, I wish I, that, that program does.

961
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:54,000
So why it is not that interesting for those developers to, to, to pay attention to it.

962
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,799
So this, this was a part that I, it didn't easy with me that why they don't pay attention

963
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:06,040
to this, like why they don't really go after fixing it.

964
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:11,920
And, uh, well, I started exploring their, their field even more, like what is actually

965
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,519
happening in the whole software engineering industry, how the software is being built,

966
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,959
that building a software is, is one thing, but you know, keeping it online, the prod

967
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,359
is, is completely different thing, right?

968
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:28,839
So you then try to understand the, the limitation, the restrictions, and then you, sometimes

969
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:33,600
you have this understanding, Hey, a lot of those security recommendations that you give

970
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,239
is actually going to break the whole thing.

971
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,000
Like it is not applicable.

972
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,399
So parts of that is related to it, but, and parts of that is a lack of understanding and

973
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,480
awareness.

974
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,720
I feel actually security need to be redefined for a lot of engineers.

975
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,320
Like I found a lot of times we are, they are so biased toward that.

976
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,359
What security is, you know, you, you will, you will talk with developers from one company,

977
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:04,040
you will find that there are security for them is dependency scanning.

978
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:08,000
And for the other ones, Oh, man in the middle, man in the middle, if it happens, it's bad.

979
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It doesn't happen.

980
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
We are safe.

981
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,359
The other, or the other ones like phishing, the other one is, Oh yeah, we need to keep

982
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:15,359
our passwords long.

983
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,359
It's authentication.

984
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:22,279
And you kind of, you bias toward that and you feel that's the security, but versus Bell

985
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:26,440
security is old and above all those things.

986
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:34,440
So I think that's where my interest kind of started kind of going rather than being

987
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,839
a game of us versus them be security guys, we find bugs, you guys need to fix it.

988
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:46,399
Just trying to understand, trying to bridge this gap.

989
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:51,440
You know, one of the things I mentioned earlier that if this is a software engineering podcast,

990
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,079
because in the terminology, even we use in security industry is different from often

991
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:01,959
vulnerability, but by the end of the day is a bug, a defect, right?

992
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:05,000
So it can be a feature.

993
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:13,079
So if it's a design, if it's the design flow, then this is a feature, but it's like, one

994
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:14,760
is actually opportunity.

995
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,679
The other is a problem kind of thing.

996
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:20,299
It's kind of redefining that, right?

997
00:58:20,299 --> 00:58:25,140
So by the end of the day, in a lot of cases, if you think about security, vulnerability

998
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:32,179
is a runtime exception, but that kind of communicates better with engineers, but for us in security

999
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:35,739
main is a vulnerability, we call it.

1000
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:42,260
So I think even just bridging those gaps, trying to understand kind of the other side

1001
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:49,700
of the game, a little bit more, and then, well, asking them to help, because if you

1002
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:57,619
look at the, if I look at the history of some security issues that was really addressed,

1003
00:58:57,619 --> 00:59:02,299
you will see there was an engineering team that they embed this kind of security control

1004
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:04,820
within the framework.

1005
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:09,299
Like obvious example of it is, for example, a skill injection, right?

1006
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:15,619
A skill injection kind of it gone away in majority of the cases, not because suddenly

1007
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:22,539
we have another community of developers, but because the framework sees that you write

1008
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:27,580
the code in it, it just doesn't allow you that raw access to the query.

1009
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:35,799
So you're saying in a way there are, I don't know, frameworks or programming languages

1010
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:45,059
that are like safer for unskilled developers to produce safe code?

1011
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:55,260
I mean, like, is this what you're trying to say, or can you say, like, for instance, that

1012
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:04,580
there is a, I don't know, framework that is like a bit more like stupidity proof or how

1013
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,580
should I say?

1014
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,580
Stupid proof.

1015
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:15,419
There's definitely frameworks that sort of prevent someone to shoot in their legs.

1016
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:16,419
Yeah.

1017
01:00:16,419 --> 01:00:17,419
Definitely.

1018
01:00:17,419 --> 01:00:18,419
There are, there are there.

1019
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:22,859
For a subset of security issues, right?

1020
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:29,020
There are, I always make this example that if someone writes a PHP app and making it

1021
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:35,219
secure, I will hire that guy because it means he's damn good in security as well, versus

1022
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:39,539
a guy who writes the same application in ASP.NET, for example, because the framework

1023
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:44,539
itself does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of like, it doesn't even just make an example

1024
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:51,940
of, and the reason I know this is because in my team, we often, we create security challenges

1025
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,380
for software engineers, and then we need to convert that to multiple languages.

1026
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:02,940
And often it's really hard to convert it in one framework versus, or versus one language.

1027
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,260
It also exposes us that the maturity in a different, you know, communities of these

1028
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:14,099
languages and, yeah, some frameworks, like we can't even introduce that security bug

1029
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:16,460
in them just because the framework just...

1030
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:24,780
It means disabling so many default protection mechanisms that you really need to pay a lot

1031
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:28,859
of effort into disabling all these whistles and blows and fear.

1032
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:29,859
Exactly.

1033
01:01:29,859 --> 01:01:30,859
Yeah.

1034
01:01:30,859 --> 01:01:38,659
So in a way, like when, like this is sort of a, for developers, when like in this planning

1035
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:43,619
phase, what stack to choose or what platform to choose or what programming language to

1036
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:45,500
choose can also...

1037
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:51,340
Perhaps the question is, the first question in this planning phase is like discussing

1038
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,219
perhaps even with stakeholders and how secure should this stuff be?

1039
01:01:55,219 --> 01:02:01,020
Like, are you running on very personal data or is this just, you know, a random blog or,

1040
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,859
you know, I think I would start there, right?

1041
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:06,580
What does this thing need to do?

1042
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,619
What kind of data does it store?

1043
01:02:08,619 --> 01:02:10,700
You know, are there any regulations or...

1044
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,979
Usually it is the other way around.

1045
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:23,419
Usually the senior engineers like choose the sexiest, the hottest framework or programming

1046
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:29,419
language out there and because this is the something like everybody is working on and

1047
01:02:29,419 --> 01:02:30,580
that's the pick.

1048
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,299
That's the weapon of choice.

1049
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:37,340
So we're victims of hype-driven development.

1050
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,340
In a way.

1051
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,340
Yeah.

1052
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:47,140
I don't think you're going to get this answer.

1053
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:52,419
I mean, again, all these, you know, especially if these are old established frameworks, they

1054
01:02:52,419 --> 01:02:57,859
have special teams, they do additional security audits regularly.

1055
01:02:57,859 --> 01:03:05,140
So if you have these kinds of frameworks that are out there for a long time, I think probably

1056
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:11,260
people have looked at the codes, they did, you know, that part, you kind of like believe

1057
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,820
that that checks were done, right?

1058
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:21,340
With new stuff, you know, there's always opportunity to find something there that...

1059
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:27,580
But equally, like if you have very old code bases, if, you know, you have software that

1060
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:33,739
is written by a lot of engineers during a lot of different periods when, you know, company

1061
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:39,020
was small and then became big and you have poor, and that's probably the next question,

1062
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:44,380
security culture in the company, you know, people doing sloppy jobs.

1063
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:47,780
It's essentially a big attack surface, I guess.

1064
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:54,340
I don't know that, Otto, because I like to think that way, but then you look at some

1065
01:03:54,340 --> 01:04:00,940
of the trend of security ones that reported even this year in really old codes, the codes

1066
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:04,940
that are open source, the code that is out there, the code that has been audited and

1067
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:11,580
most likely being scanned by numerous applications, and still you find, well, like security issues

1068
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:15,020
there.

1069
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:20,059
On the other side, we actually have some people in security that they lost hope that, sorry,

1070
01:04:20,059 --> 01:04:24,900
we can't teach devs how to write this secure code, they just make it harder for them to

1071
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:30,739
build something, at least that will eventually result into in a more secure stage, is a mix

1072
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:36,820
of things that you will find, I mean, you kind of assume that the new frameworks may

1073
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:43,900
have more holes, but not necessarily, it could be a security issue related to a library that

1074
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:49,539
they are using, and there is a security bug there, and then it goes on.

1075
01:04:49,539 --> 01:04:55,580
But you know, today you don't use this framework, you also use third-party libraries, you also

1076
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:03,739
inject ads in your page through whatever, you know, people use, they install a lot of

1077
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:09,260
different things on their devices, so there's a lot of potential to...

1078
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:14,979
So you shouldn't limit yourself to only your part of the code, but the whole ecosystem,

1079
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:15,979
the whole system.

1080
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:21,340
But I think we still need to be like pragmatic, right, in the end of the day, developers do

1081
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,820
need to ship something in a reasonable amount of time.

1082
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,820
Sure.

1083
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:27,820
Yeah.

1084
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:34,140
The way I see it, like the simple exercise, like I think, like each developer team should

1085
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:41,020
do is threat modeling in terms of understanding what are the...

1086
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,780
Please explain this to our audience.

1087
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:57,820
So in a way of writing down or using a diagram way of how your application is working and

1088
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:09,020
how data is going through your application, where are like possibilities of sort of risk

1089
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:16,219
that could happen, and how are you going to prevent this from happening, and like it gives

1090
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:23,820
you a way to sort of do, in a way, risk management.

1091
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:32,979
But also this exercise is also good in a way to you figuring out what are your crown jewels.

1092
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:36,739
So basically, what are you actually going to protect?

1093
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:42,059
Because sometimes like there are people that are investing a lot of money in, I don't know,

1094
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:49,659
web application firewalls and protecting completely like things that are not that important.

1095
01:06:49,659 --> 01:06:56,419
But on the other hand, they might say have the like personal data unencrypted somewhere

1096
01:06:56,419 --> 01:07:01,979
and they're doing like maybe the backups that are also unencrypted and that, I don't know,

1097
01:07:01,979 --> 01:07:04,140
shipping that to S3 bucket.

1098
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,699
Is it enough to just write this down and make sure that everybody understands this or do

1099
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:11,300
you periodically then monitor these things?

1100
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,300
Of course.

1101
01:07:12,819 --> 01:07:20,180
In a way, you want to, like the way I see it, you want to like when doing a new feature

1102
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:27,979
to the application or product you're developing, you again do this threat modeling.

1103
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:34,099
Because in a way, you already create one and one of the new features, you will see how

1104
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:36,780
this affects the whole system.

1105
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,939
Yeah, I mean, threat modeling, definitely, I'll actually call it a rapid threat modeling,

1106
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:44,939
something that is more effective.

1107
01:07:44,939 --> 01:07:50,579
The problem I found is, again, it's hard to get devs to think about threats and it kind

1108
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:54,579
of comes back to the old conversation we had, builder and breaker mindset.

1109
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:59,099
Like people who are good in building something does not necessarily know how things can break

1110
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:01,540
and it's completely understandable.

1111
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:07,140
So it's kind of also you need to kind of empower them one more level that, okay, these are

1112
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,219
the possible things can go wrong regardless of what feature you're working on.

1113
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:15,579
You need to think about whether this could be applicable to the things because...

1114
01:08:15,579 --> 01:08:23,140
Are these things like, we now have these static code analyzers that read the code and spit

1115
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:30,500
out, I don't know, potential issues that are like wrong use of code or static code analyzers

1116
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,979
check the code, but they can also...

1117
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:37,060
You have similar tools to kind of like security testing as well.

1118
01:08:37,099 --> 01:08:42,099
Is that enough or we need to also build awareness and knowledge and developers?

1119
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:43,099
Everything.

1120
01:08:43,099 --> 01:08:44,099
Everything.

1121
01:08:44,099 --> 01:08:45,099
Throw everything at it.

1122
01:08:45,099 --> 01:08:48,739
Whatever you can do in a security, just do it.

1123
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:56,459
It's such a chaotic, unfortunate environment that I personally think, and I have examples

1124
01:08:56,459 --> 01:09:01,219
of that, that when devs are on board with the idea of the security is important, we

1125
01:09:01,219 --> 01:09:03,699
should take it seriously.

1126
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:08,099
You go miles away in terms of your security culture and maturity rather than if you want

1127
01:09:08,099 --> 01:09:12,540
the tool to tell you whether you're doing something good or not.

1128
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:16,540
Because oftentimes, I mean, I'm not talking about the false positive, false negatives

1129
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:21,300
and most likely you dealt with it a lot, but it's not going to change the culture.

1130
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,099
It's not going to change the understanding.

1131
01:09:23,099 --> 01:09:26,219
For me, the problem actually starts in the brain of that.

1132
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:29,540
I'm going to challenge you here on this.

1133
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:34,300
These organizations, responsibility starts from the top, right?

1134
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:42,160
So I need to sell your service and your services to my boss as engineer or engineering lead.

1135
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,260
How do you convince people from top down that security is so important that they're going

1136
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:54,060
to now invest into tools or education of their developers so that it becomes something that

1137
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,020
the company should care about?

1138
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,859
So how do you propagate that information from the top to the bottom?

1139
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:03,780
Do you need to convince people that, you know, we're going to lose a lot of money or we're

1140
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:08,819
going to have bad publicity or all of these things?

1141
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:11,619
I don't know.

1142
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:14,819
I don't even know someone who would know much.

1143
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:19,739
I mean, in reality, still, there is a lot of security budgets are being approved because

1144
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:22,219
of compliance requirement, because of some legislation.

1145
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:23,219
And that's true.

1146
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:28,380
You see the amount of security assessment done by organization and financial sectors.

1147
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:34,099
Well, the one reason may not be so much about leaking data is because of compliance.

1148
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:38,500
Of course, leaking data, financial thing is a serious thing.

1149
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:46,579
But I think still that has a great, you know, power to it.

1150
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:47,939
Like, yeah, there was a standard.

1151
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:48,939
How do you convince that guy?

1152
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:52,020
I don't know.

1153
01:10:52,020 --> 01:11:00,979
To be honest, like security is pretty hard to sell, like basically on one hand, you might

1154
01:11:00,979 --> 01:11:16,180
choose to do sort of like those scarcity and say what is like out there on the Internet

1155
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,579
and how you're going to be hacked and impounded.

1156
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:21,380
I actually want to say something.

1157
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:25,219
My job at the moment is not so much dealing with the people higher up.

1158
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:30,180
It's actually hard to convince the developer to think about security because that's for

1159
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,579
me is a bigger problem.

1160
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:41,979
How you make security is interesting and engaging for a software engineer.

1161
01:11:41,979 --> 01:11:50,819
Because by the end of the day, whatever security issue we have is a rare use case or edge case.

1162
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:55,619
And if you look at the backlog of what this dev guy is going to do is like this feature,

1163
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:59,339
that feature, but most of it is filled with lots of other bugs.

1164
01:11:59,339 --> 01:12:05,459
How would you make the old security bug being something on top of that, that it needs immediate

1165
01:12:05,459 --> 01:12:06,579
attention?

1166
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:08,780
So we're dealing with those priorities as well.

1167
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:15,979
I think that's the part for me is interesting to talk like, what are the things would make

1168
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:17,979
security interesting for engineers?

1169
01:12:17,979 --> 01:12:20,020
Because that's all my hope here.

1170
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,020
And what do you propose?

1171
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,140
How do you make it interesting?

1172
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:27,819
You gave me a fine.

1173
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:28,819
You want to start?

1174
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:31,459
No, no, no.

1175
01:12:31,459 --> 01:12:32,459
It's a good question.

1176
01:12:32,459 --> 01:12:34,619
That's a segue to the next.

1177
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:48,900
I still want to be here at Application Security and maybe start before going how to do this

1178
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:59,660
education purpose or do this education of developers.

1179
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:10,540
How to explain security to them, how to make them engage in this, like what he said, with

1180
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:21,819
gamification of this or showing real examples and showing the code or is like what usually

1181
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:29,180
or let's say usually is done, like there's an external pen test, like breaking down the

1182
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:36,939
code and just sending the report to R&D and saying this, everything you see on the report

1183
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:37,939
is broken.

1184
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:38,939
You need to fix it.

1185
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:39,939
What's the...

1186
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:43,739
Definitely, I can say things that doesn't work is top-down approach.

1187
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:47,819
Like if a manager said that you have to do security, that's not going to work, or you

1188
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:48,819
have to do this security.

1189
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:49,819
I mean, address that.

1190
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:55,060
That's not going to change anything in that dev's mindset that security is important.

1191
01:13:55,060 --> 01:14:01,939
But things kind of learning more about their worldview of what they would care, like I

1192
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:05,859
found every developer is interested in problem solving.

1193
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:09,500
They are interested and engaged in, well, make something better.

1194
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,819
Well, guess what?

1195
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:14,380
When you make a software secure, you have a better code quality.

1196
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:18,099
You may have an even better, more reliable application.

1197
01:14:18,099 --> 01:14:25,660
Kind of trying to highlight these angles more than it's just the edge case that, hey, no,

1198
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,380
actually your program does more than what it should.

1199
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,739
Well, for example, you just need to...

1200
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:36,900
You could just make an example of a calculator that needs to take two numbers and give you

1201
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,900
a result.

1202
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:41,780
Well, we can implement that in many different ways.

1203
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:49,060
When you show that a certain way of implementation of that calculator could also allow someone

1204
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:54,979
to inject additional code and execute code using your calculator, and kind of saying

1205
01:14:54,979 --> 01:14:58,739
that, but by the end of the day, you just wanted to build a calculator, why you just

1206
01:14:58,739 --> 01:14:59,979
don't make your software just...

1207
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,880
calculation. Don't worry about what else can happen, just that part. It actually makes their

1208
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:15,760
software to do that things even better. So that's what I find is interesting. Of course, the whole

1209
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,719
concept of gamification also is proven. I feel competition also, it's something that helps.

1210
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:34,240
If stay on this, what would be, I don't know, to maintain secure hygiene inside

1211
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,240
development lifecycle? What would be steps that...

1212
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,720
I think it's just everyone's job. I think, first of all, start thinking about this is

1213
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,160
that the security team should are a gatekeeper of our organization.

1214
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:59,759
Sure, sure. But what would be, I don't know, five, three top things that each company or each

1215
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:10,959
business that is focusing in development should invest effort, money, what to consider?

1216
01:16:11,919 --> 01:16:17,919
I mean, some of the key things there is a lot of things, but

1217
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:29,360
just this understanding that perhaps security is not a single team's job,

1218
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,279
and showing them a real example of that, an incident that actually happened,

1219
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:41,599
that proved the case that if security, if we're just relying on just an audit to come through,

1220
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:50,160
or things like that, how many things can be missed? You can't have your junior developers

1221
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:55,199
or even senior developers advocating about security, and then you have your tech leads

1222
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:00,320
and software architect that pushing for features that need to be released yesterday. That doesn't

1223
01:17:00,959 --> 01:17:09,279
work. You need to give your team a time to think twice about the code that they write,

1224
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:14,479
the design that they build, which kind of contradicts with the speed of a lot of businesses

1225
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:20,240
going this way. But sorry to say that is to make a software usable is one thing,

1226
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:24,720
but to make it secure is another thing. You can make a software that perfectly function,

1227
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:31,279
but it isn't secure. What will take you to go there? Well, one fact is just give your team more

1228
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:38,320
time. Because there are cases that I had, the team, the devs, they're really on board with the

1229
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,399
idea that I really like to do trade modeling. I really like to follow this secure design pattern

1230
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:51,199
to implement my code. But the thing is, I can't, because I'm not even given the time to do it.

1231
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,360
So I think that's a bigger problem to solve first. And then after that, once you have that

1232
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:07,440
established, then making devs more familiar with the ways that things are going to get

1233
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:14,240
exploited. And kind of making them more familiar with this breaker mindset that

1234
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:21,520
so they can start thinking intuitively about, well, what can go wrong? Rather than just thinking

1235
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,320
about what program should do, they should also think about what program should not do,

1236
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:34,000
which is again, the sky is the limit. I'm worried.

1237
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:40,720
It's a tough question. Should in the process of quality assurance,

1238
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,880
should also a security test be part of this? I think it's okay. Isn't it already there?

1239
01:18:49,839 --> 01:19:00,000
I don't know. Usually or not. Usually QA is focusing on usability and if the product is

1240
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:09,839
reaching some performance that is expected and so on, but usually the security is left out.

1241
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:20,399
Well, last time I was sort of a situation like the feature went through the Q&A.

1242
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:30,959
Everything was like great. And then on the bug bounty, it sort of found a huge security flaw.

1243
01:19:30,959 --> 01:19:37,839
And then like we sort of go back to Q&A and said, wasn't that tested? And they were like,

1244
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:44,640
well, that's not expected to be the input. Why would someone do that?

1245
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,320
Exactly. They were like questioning, why would somebody do that?

1246
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:54,320
So it's not essentially the QA's job is not to do security audit or

1247
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:00,320
look for that kind of loops. I mean, they can help. But again,

1248
01:20:01,519 --> 01:20:06,959
the way that we are, again, my knowledge of it is limited to, again, to those people who have,

1249
01:20:06,959 --> 01:20:15,519
I try, we try to train them as a QA to kind of look for security issues. But there are two things

1250
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:22,880
you reach there is like their skill level. That's one thing. And the second is the defined task of

1251
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:29,119
things that they have to do. Like often they may need to use the UI interface to interact with

1252
01:20:29,839 --> 01:20:34,559
their backend versus you may find actually, if you remove that UI, you just directly interact

1253
01:20:34,559 --> 01:20:40,239
with the API. You can find security issues there, but that's not even defined. That's not even their

1254
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:46,320
job because one of us said, their usability is actually more highlighted there than these

1255
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:53,359
security edge cases. So that's what I said, throw everything at it. It's just whatever you think is

1256
01:20:53,359 --> 01:21:00,160
suitable for your organization. I'm going to use this, throw everything at it.

1257
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:08,959
You have this beautiful product and a service as well, I imagine. It's called SecDim. So SecDocs

1258
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:16,480
is events, but SecDim is your company if I understand correctly. And what you guys do is

1259
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:24,160
very mix of the things that we described here, but you kind of like offer these things to companies.

1260
01:21:25,519 --> 01:21:29,440
But I will still invite you to explain to us what SecDim is and what you guys do.

1261
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:36,640
Yeah. So it pretty much started with workshops, running secure development workshops for

1262
01:21:38,959 --> 01:21:44,079
developers. We actually started right in the middle of COVID, the start of the COVID.

1263
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:44,720
Beautiful time.

1264
01:21:47,519 --> 01:21:55,200
And then it kind of started with that because I felt that's like a missing part. We do need to

1265
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:01,119
get more engineers involved to help us to solve some security problems. I'm not just talking about

1266
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,079
developers to be able to put a patch here and there. I'm talking about those more like fundamental

1267
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:12,399
solutions. Like can they put something in the compiler? Can they think about a popular third

1268
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:18,320
party library that won't disallow these things? So this is, I think, more on engineering side to

1269
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:25,760
solve that. So that's why I kind of, I reached out more on that. So the workshops, these are

1270
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,799
the things that we regularly run for companies privately. We do have also public workshops.

1271
01:22:30,799 --> 01:22:38,320
The focus is effectively how to build a defensive software from scratch. So rather

1272
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:44,320
than bombarding the engineers or devs with, oh, this security issue, that security bug,

1273
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:50,079
that vulnerability, is there anything else we can do that you kind of, when you start writing

1274
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:55,839
a software, you follow that, or some of those principles and can make your software relatively,

1275
01:22:55,839 --> 01:23:04,239
reliably secure. That's one thing. And as part of that, this platform came out, which,

1276
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:13,440
again, was outreach to the people to, hey, you want to try to see how a security bug

1277
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:22,880
can be addressed. Now, one thing I actually found, through experience, I found is missing is that,

1278
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,799
so when I started, you know, we talked about Capture the Flag. When I started

1279
01:23:27,519 --> 01:23:36,400
delivering my workshops a few years ago, it was to make developers more engaged in security,

1280
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:41,440
definitely I would include the CTF part that, hey, you know, it's the end of the workshop,

1281
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,640
just do a CTF, just hack some things. And, you know, someone at the end will be,

1282
01:23:45,919 --> 01:23:50,320
it was engaging, it was interesting. Perhaps they would learn a new security issue,

1283
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,039
but there was always this problem missing. By the end of the day, this person needs to go back and

1284
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:59,679
fix this, but we haven't even talked about that part. This is out of scope for security, right?

1285
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:05,520
You deal with that. I told you the bug, you figure out how to fix it. And that's how I felt where

1286
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,640
the problem is. Like, we may these days talk

1287
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:18,159
good about some of the security issues that we have normally in a security language, but we don't

1288
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:27,119
really talk so much about ways and bad ways of fixing it. So the idea of this platform I built

1289
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:32,880
was, well, we have Capture the Flag, how about we have thing called Fix the Flag? So you go to

1290
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:38,080
score... Sort of a reverse Capture the Flag. Reverse Capture the Flag. You, I even show you

1291
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:45,760
where is the security bug is, but you only get the score if you fix it in the right way. Now,

1292
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:52,000
originally, some of those, the ways that we were testing, if someone can fix the flag was

1293
01:24:52,559 --> 01:25:00,559
too restrictive. And to my, well, kind of, I learned that, well, no, this is a huge lack of

1294
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:06,080
understanding and awareness somewhere. So we needed to kind of relax that. But now it's

1295
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:12,239
interesting just to see how people actually think about a single problem, but they fix it in a

1296
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:23,280
completely different way. And obviously also learning how to, well, make something or write

1297
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:31,520
a better patch for something that I'm publishing. So in practical terms, you know, you log into

1298
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:37,599
the SegDim website, probably you can do this on your own, or you also offer workshop, as you said,

1299
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:45,760
you get like a zip file or a repository of a code that it has security vulnerability.

1300
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,000
And then you try to fix it and then you upload it and the tool will tell you if you actually

1301
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,799
solved the problem or not, right? That's the mechanics of this thing, right?

1302
01:25:56,799 --> 01:26:02,719
So the idea was exactly. So kind of you bring those security issues to the language that

1303
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:07,119
developers understand. So, and the tooling that the developers, they have, like, so you have

1304
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:13,520
Git, you have containers, you know, and translate to some of the security issues.

1305
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,080
So let's just call it, I don't know, the one that I talk a lot, new integer workflow,

1306
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:26,159
not necessarily in a text or a video recording of me talking, translate that to a test that

1307
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:32,000
developers will deal with it on a daily basis. And the goal of the challenge is that can you pass

1308
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,559
the test? Now, depending on the complexity of the challenge, you may being given the test,

1309
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:43,200
so you can clearly see what is the input, what is the expected output that as it gets more

1310
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,719
challenging, the tests are missing. Because the idea is that, well, the hacker will never give

1311
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,799
you their test, you have to figure that out yourself. Okay. That's an improvement then.

1312
01:26:53,359 --> 01:27:01,359
Okay. Okay. Okay. So, but also encouraging developers in very like a implicit way that

1313
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:05,359
maybe you want to think about writing these tests yourself for your program.

1314
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:11,919
You learn that if a program just deal with two numbers, right? There are these usability tests

1315
01:27:11,919 --> 01:27:17,200
that it has to always pass, but how about these other things that can result in a security issue?

1316
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:24,239
So, it's a kind of, they learn it by practicing and the other things that are getting the score

1317
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:30,479
and like getting their name on the ladder board is like more like cream on the top. But they're,

1318
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:37,359
yeah. I had to, maybe, please, please, please let me, please, and I'll let you. I found it

1319
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:45,039
very interesting. Like you don't just say, you know, this is integer overflow assignment or

1320
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:54,000
something. You have these kind of like practical stories, how a company got hacked or how literally

1321
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,919
millions or billions were lost because of this exploit, which means that there is a real world

1322
01:27:59,919 --> 01:28:05,359
connection of this security issue that you actually learn about. Can you tell us a bit

1323
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:07,679
more how do you design these things? That was interesting you mentioned,

1324
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,880
because that happened again throughout some of my workshops that I found. In security,

1325
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:17,280
we are not really great in naming something. We're actually really good in naming something

1326
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:22,400
really complex, like I don't know, cross-site request forgery or server-side request forgery.

1327
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:30,239
Yeah, but keep in mind that lately it's very popular when a new like exploit of something

1328
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:36,000
is found or new bug is found, we need to create a logo. We need to create a special site where

1329
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:44,799
CVE is published. So this is something that's becoming popular to name the attack or the bug.

1330
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:47,440
Hard bleed.

1331
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,000
Hard bleed.

1332
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,559
There was a changeover. It was a lot of, I mean, our industry got just lifted up and

1333
01:28:54,559 --> 01:28:59,919
become suddenly super popular. But yeah, just coming back to that again, our goal,

1334
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:04,479
my goal is to get more hopeful engineers on the security side. So whatever

1335
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:10,799
makes them to remember about this security issue. If I tell someone, hey, this is a

1336
01:29:10,799 --> 01:29:14,880
server-side request forgery bug, two months from today, they're going to forget about it.

1337
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:20,000
But if I say, hey, this is a bug that happened to X, Y, Z component resulted into that.

1338
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:27,440
Now having this interesting story, someone after like a few years ago, he did like a workshop,

1339
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:32,960
came to me and say, hey, you know, can you just help me figure these things part of the code out?

1340
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:39,599
I think this may have that GitHub bug. What do you mean GitHub bug? That bug, you know,

1341
01:29:39,599 --> 01:29:45,679
it was GitHub. He's talking about there was a major vulnerability in GitHub for mass assignment.

1342
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:51,359
We call it mass assignment, but that kind of tell me, okay, that seems to work. That kind of

1343
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,919
sticks in their mind. Yeah. And I think, yeah.

1344
01:29:55,919 --> 01:30:05,840
And like the process of you preparing these challenges, like you basically

1345
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:17,440
tailor this to based on the company that is like acquire your services and based on their stack

1346
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:25,599
or so, or based on your past experience of you being the code reviewer of auditing the code and

1347
01:30:25,599 --> 01:30:32,159
seeing what are the most common mistakes the developers do. I'll create a bunch of

1348
01:30:33,919 --> 01:30:42,080
examples or exercises for this kind of bugs. How is the process of what is relevant or what

1349
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:49,440
developers are working on? So there's like a different levels of content given the maturity

1350
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:56,400
of that organization. So there are kind of a group of security bugs that regardless of you

1351
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:03,440
writing Python or use Kubernetes, you need to be aware of them. So we make them tailored toward

1352
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:08,239
that organization that, Hey, okay, these are the things you have to follow. And then the next nice

1353
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:15,039
thing is that then the next step is because the whole platform has an open SDK, they can even

1354
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:20,400
contribute their own type of problems. And that will be presented in terms of challenge. So

1355
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:28,479
a lot of times it happens that we turn a security audit report into a challenge because oftentimes

1356
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:33,840
a security report comes in and then you get few people, you know, dealing with that, fixing the

1357
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:40,640
bug and that's it. And the whole knowledge is gone. What was it? But rather than we kind of

1358
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:44,880
want to make that more persistent for that organization, like you have new devs coming in,

1359
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:51,599
Hey, do you know we had this bug? Well, here's now a challenge for it. Can you try to solve it?

1360
01:31:51,599 --> 01:31:57,280
And the goal is to fix it. We simulate the same bug for them and they will kind of try to do it.

1361
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:07,280
That's primarily the focus is and the other part is more running a competition or game events for

1362
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:16,560
them. Like you want to dedicate time for the team to come in one day and start exploring some of

1363
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:22,000
these security issues. Can't just, you know, give them a link and go and do it on your own.

1364
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,000
Yeah, they probably did that already.

1365
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,400
Should we bring the ship to bring that ship in?

1366
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:36,400
Yeah. Yeah. I was like thinking maybe, maybe like from

1367
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:45,359
how, how, how long have you like done this kind of workshop of dealing with developers? So I'm

1368
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:51,599
thinking, thinking of like the track record of, of you running the workshops perhaps is like eight

1369
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,479
Running the workshops perhaps is like eight years.

1370
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:54,719
Okay.

1371
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:55,920
So I was running it in a different place.

1372
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:01,920
And, and in, in, in this eight years, like you still see what are the, the top three,

1373
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:10,400
like major flaws that developers are still like, or what is it called? Deadly sins in,

1374
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:15,920
in, in software development. What is, what is still, still out there? And, and I know

1375
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:25,680
if, if you, if you, if you track a tracker, this at all, I mean, it's.

1376
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,839
You can, you can see in his eyes, all the horrors.

1377
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:36,479
I mean, you mean, what are the, you're talking about what's still.

1378
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:37,760
Yeah. What is happening?

1379
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:44,079
Yeah. Of course. Like what kind of mistakes are, are, are developers still like making

1380
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:50,800
in terms of like, like example, like you, you presented the, the, the challenge yesterday.

1381
01:33:52,640 --> 01:34:00,560
For instance, the integer overflow that was like, like crucial in, in, in a way of understanding.

1382
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,959
Or what, what is still out there?

1383
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:13,119
Uh, well, I, I can say one of the, well, these quick fixes, like without really understanding

1384
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:18,719
what the root cause of the problem is trying to quickly put some, if a statement around the thing,

1385
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:24,400
we talked about Heartbleed. I do encourage you to go and look at the patch for the heart and don't

1386
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:29,359
be surprised to just see two, if a statement for that security bug. So kind of not really

1387
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:35,599
So kind of not really understanding, Hey, this security bug cannot be treated like other bugs

1388
01:34:35,599 --> 01:34:41,520
that you fix in your program. I think that's the thing I still feel is, is missing quite a lot.

1389
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,800
Like you can just put a couple of statements here and there just to patch things.

1390
01:34:47,839 --> 01:34:56,560
Um, one of the things that I'm keep talking about, it is all about, uh, I mean,

1391
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,119
it's just so many security issues. I don't know which one I pick.

1392
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,079
Name one, name one.

1393
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:13,920
Like, I mean, like some of the, like some of the things that is reappearing is like

1394
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,520
this whole concept of like, you know, front-end validation is a, is a joke.

1395
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:25,839
You need to do things on backend. I thought we solved this problem, but it's kind of coming back

1396
01:35:25,839 --> 01:35:31,439
and you still see, well, these things that just did the validation on front-end and the QA didn't

1397
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:36,479
pick it up because they use the UI to interact with the API. And modern web frameworks in the

1398
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:43,520
front-end are becoming more and more popular and everything is being done in front-end and,

1399
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:50,479
you know, whatever isn't back. A lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, the other thing you see a lot is a lot of

1400
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:56,079
what got information disclosure that API is just send too much information to the front-end library

1401
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:00,479
because the heavy lifting is done by front-end library. And you don't actually know, actually,

1402
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:05,280
if you observe just the traffic that comes in, it's just a too much content. I had one case that

1403
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:11,599
I could see even the password hashes of people. And I think that the security bugs, the one that

1404
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:16,719
I feel companies need to go after are those ones that are in the, their business logic,

1405
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:23,040
their semantic ones. They are the ones that get popped and get attacked. I think we are kind of

1406
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:27,520
relatively good on a low hanging fruit, the things that, you know, the scanners can pick up, but the

1407
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:33,199
ones that they are really deep inside the code and mostly related to the semantic of the code,

1408
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:42,160
they are the ones that, yeah, it's still, it's just still there. So maybe like to, to end this.

1409
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:48,640
We need to invite Pedram to some Slovenian beers now, probably.

1410
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,640
Do you enjoy Slovenian beer? Which one? Which one?

1411
01:36:56,959 --> 01:37:00,640
So maybe like, I don't know, words of wisdom from you.

1412
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:05,359
Last few words. Yeah. What, what would be like in terms,

1413
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:11,839
in terms of, I don't know, addressing developers, addressing the, the, the management,

1414
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:24,800
running the business. I think it's just get early, get security early in, like you get

1415
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:34,319
benefit of cost saving a lot, the earliest, the better. Like, so, and that's why I was really

1416
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:38,880
advocating for training because that's the earliest stage you can, you can get security in when you

1417
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:44,000
are, when that feature inception or like that scrum meeting that you have to talk about the

1418
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,400
feature, actually, that's the time you can start thinking about security really early on. And you

1419
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,680
can stop things to, to happen right there before, you know, you implementing the code and someone

1420
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,760
auditor comes in to do it. So I think you get security in as early as possible.

1421
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:04,959
Okay. So wise words. Will you say thank you to everybody or should I?

1422
01:38:04,959 --> 01:38:10,160
You should. Well, Pedram, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it. Andraž,

1423
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:17,199
thank you for, for this kind, kind words and leadership in this. And thank you,

1424
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:22,479
our listeners of Ugrodje and thanks to supporters. We have so many that I can name them. So

1425
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:29,520
I can say thank you Jan, Jan, Janč and Marko for supporting us. And I hope that you guys will give

1426
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:35,359
us some feedback, especially given that this is now in English and till next time. Thank you very

1427
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:41,599
much. Yeah. And we promise to like, maybe do another about security because we saw that security

1428
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:48,319
is quite popular, like in, in, in Discord. Yeah, there's tons of, yeah, we need to,

1429
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:59,040
we need to finish now. Thank you everybody. And thanks for sharing. Thank you. Bye.
