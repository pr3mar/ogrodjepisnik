1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Zdravstveno v Ugrodje, frameworku, Ugrodje v Sloveniji, imamo novi epizod Borderless.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ugrodje je slovenski tehnologični podkast, se spomagajte, da ga vidite. Zdaj imamo našega prijatelja, Nika Jacksona, principalna razvojačka HashiCorp. Zdravstveno v Ugrodje.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Zdravstveno.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Če bi povedal, kje smo sedaj, ker ni to naša običajna mesta, kjer naši rekord.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Zdaj ne bodo slišali kakšne treni, ki se običajno imajo ali kakšne običaje, ki se običajno običajo. Zdaj smo tukaj v Deovske dne, v Ljubljani.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Smo v Free, fakultetu informatika in komputerske znanje. Zdaj, je to zelo dobro mesto. Poznali smo, da ne završimo se v poklicu, da lahko poživimo nekaj zvokov v okolji.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Če slišali smo, da smo imeli podobne situacije v popolnem epizodu, tako da je to znova ustvarja.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Tako je. Naši tehničništi so resnično odlični, imajo nekaj čarobnega magiče, ne srečujem. Zdaj, razmišljajo vse zvokove v okolji, ali v bistvu tako več kot morajo.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Kako si, Nick?

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Zelo dobro sem. Vse dva tako dobro?

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Da, da. Zdaj smo vse skupaj, naša skupina je Andraš, jaz tudi Andraš, imamo tukaj veliko ljudi.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Če je nekaj, ki je nekaj kot Koto, je tukaj.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Da, da. Naš producer, z lepim smilom. Da, moramo priti?

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Zdaj smo tukaj na DevOp Days Ljubljana. Zdaj, današnji epizod bo bolj razgovarjal o kulturi DevOp.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Zdaj, prišli smo na prvi DevOp Days. V resnici, s svojo profesionalno kariero, HashiCorp in tako dalje. Kaj vidiš, ne vem, 10 let tukaj, v različnih različnih od tukaj?

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Zdaj, DevOp v tem času je bil začetek od vsega sistemnega predstavljenja, ampak je bil začetek boljših vključnosti. In mislim, da smo slišno prišli tukaj. Zdaj, to je bilo dloži čas, ampak gledam na mojo obdobje.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:29,000
začetek. Zdaj, gledam na mojo obdobje. Zdaj, gledam na moje obdobe. Zdaj, gledam na mojo obdobe.

18
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Zdaj, gledam na moje obdobje.

19
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Zdaj, gledam na moje obdobje

20
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Zdaj, gledam na moje obdobje

21
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Zdaj, gledam na moje obdobje

22
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Zdaj, gledam na moje obdobje

23
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Zdaj, gledam na moje obdobje

24
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Zdaj, možda će Andraš napisati svoju perspektivu.

25
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ja bih rekao ovako.

26
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Svaki htjele biti kao dobro kao velike ljudi.

27
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
A ako htjele biti kao dobro kao velike firme,

28
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
možda ako si mali ili start-up,

29
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
htjeli si raditi stvari poprije.

30
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ako htjeli si raditi stvari poprije,

31
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
trebate da se specijalizirate u tehnologijama.

32
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I stvar koju gledam je,

33
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
kada se pomeni o Kubernetesu,

34
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
to je odličan framework i tool,

35
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
ali potrebuješ super dedikaciju ljudi

36
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
da se ovo posluži,

37
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
osim ako govorimo o intermedijalnom nivlu ljudi

38
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
koji su možda 5 godina u svojoj karijeri.

39
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Kubernetes nije samo druga tehnologija.

40
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Trebaju da se ovo skupaju.

41
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I zatim začneš izgubiti ovaj kontakt

42
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
kada se pomeni,

43
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
da želimo provoditi značajnu valiju,

44
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
da ustvarimo pristopno, ne vem,

45
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
ansibolno pristopno,

46
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
ki bo delal vsega in vse bodo razumeli.

47
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Mislim, da je to vse skupaj možno

48
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ali samo za developerje.

49
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ampak ko se pomeni o tehnologijah,

50
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ki so zelo velike predstave,

51
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
in možda bi bilo to zelo kompleksno

52
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
za večinu predstav,

53
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
tako imaš tudi tako nezgodbo,

54
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ker se ljudje razvijajo,

55
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
ker je zelo zgodbo,

56
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
in je težko je predstaviti.

57
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In tako imaš to skupaj.

58
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Mislim, da ljudje imajo to občutje,

59
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
da se zgubijo ali se gledajo na socialne medije,

60
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
ko je to veliko,

61
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
in možda je to zelo prekompleksno za njih.

62
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ne vem, da li si podobno povzgošal.

63
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Ja, sem se spominjal, da je Kelsi Hightower

64
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
v tem, da je ustvarjal svojo meme,

65
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
kjer je bil tako, da se predstavlja

66
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
blog za Kubernetes.

67
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In mislim, da je to nekaj zgodbo.

68
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Mislim, da je Kubernetes v celi

69
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
vprašanje tega,

70
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
da moramo ustvarjati

71
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
najmanje instanske vprašanje

72
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
na različnih predstavah.

73
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In s tako vsega prihaja kompleksnost.

74
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Mislim, da je tako tako,

75
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
kako ti pomeniš, da ljudje se učijo.

76
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Seveda je zelo težko.

77
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ko sem začel svojo karieru,

78
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
sem prihajal pravih 30 let,

79
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ampak svojo prvi resnično del,

80
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
ko sem delal v Internetu,

81
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
sem ustvarjal svojo sredino za Formijo 1.

82
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
V tem času je to sredino

83
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
za globalno Formijo 1

84
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
na dva servira.

85
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Imeli smo Apache front-end,

86
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
ki je imel PHP,

87
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
in imeli smo Oracle server,

88
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ki je delal databas.

89
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Dva boxe z SunSolaris.

90
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
In v tem času so bilo tri ljudi

91
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
na Internetu,

92
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
in to ni bilo nekaj.

93
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
V tem času je bilo kompleksno,

94
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
kaj moraš naučiti kot aplikacija.

95
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Moral sem naučiti nekaj o Linuxu.

96
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Moral sem naučiti

97
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
nekaj o težkih okoljih,

98
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
kako se pravi Apache.

99
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Kaj je konfiguracija,

100
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
kako se odloži v aplikacijo

101
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
in kako se konfigura

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
plug-in za PHP.

103
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Moral sem razumeti PHP

104
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
in nekaj SQL.

105
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Nikoli nekaj težkih.

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Zdaj moram razumeti,

107
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
povedajmo,

108
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
da vedno delam v PHP.

109
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Moram razumeti mojo PHP.

110
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Moram razumeti Kubernetes,

111
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
ker moram razumeti,

112
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
kako se bo aplikacija odložila.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Moram razumeti

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
nadaljevanje strukture,

115
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
kaj se je delalo v Kube-klustru,

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
ker moram razumeti,

117
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
kako so node odložene,

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
če so v skupinah autoskela,

119
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
kako to povezuje z odloženjem

120
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
in kako to povezuje

121
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
z prihodnostjo aplikacije.

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Moram razumeti,

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
kako se je odložilo.

124
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Moram razumeti,

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
da smo včasih

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
prekompleksirali vse,

127
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
ko poživljamo

128
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
zelo nove tehnologije

129
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
in nove stvari

130
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
v naših stakovah.

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Prvič, ko sem gledal,

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
kako je

133
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
infrastruktura

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
stakovnega odloženja

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
izgledala.

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Je prosto.

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Včasih je zelo prosto

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
za stvari,

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
ki jo imajo potrebo.

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Če se to povezujete

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
s nekaj inego,

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
ki bo začel

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
ustvarjati arhitekturo,

144
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
bi rekel, da imamo

145
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
nekaj, ki je

146
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
kot Kubernetes,

147
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
imamo odloženje,

148
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
in v koncu,

149
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
kot je Andraž spomenul,

150
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
možda to ni,

151
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
ampak razumemo

152
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
vse.

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Počnemo

154
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
z lepimi tehnologijami,

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
lepo je imeti

156
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
možda vse potrebe,

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
ki ne bojo

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
poživljali,

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
ampak je to

160
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
nekaj,

161
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
ki se bo poživljali v koncu.

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Ne znam,

163
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
prvič,

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
mislim, da je

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
stakovna arhitektura

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
težka.

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Mislim, da je

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
ustvarjanje

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
sistema

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
po pravem

171
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
skladu

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
zelo težko.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
In potem imaš

174
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
kompleksnost v aplikaciji.

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Tako,

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
ne želim

177

592
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
what you've learned and practiced.

593
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,800
So maybe that also is kind of a driver on why we're using in some cases

594
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,840
inappropriate use of technology.

595
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,120
And maybe we need to like flip this as a business.

596
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,280
And then, you know, the reality is it shouldn't be about what you know.

597
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,680
It should be about the efficiency that you can drive within the organization.

598
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,639
Now, actually having a broad spectrum of knowledge helps you to understand that

599
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:28,600
maybe the most complex tool is not the right tool and actually the best solution

600
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,799
for the business, which derives the best value and efficiency is the simplest tool.

601
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,080
And avoiding the Kubernetes and going for just the, you know, we just need a VM.

602
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,000
So let's just create a VM.

603
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:46,919
So maybe, maybe we need to kind of think about, I think about that as well.

604
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,680
But, but I certainly think, like, you know, this yourselves, like if you, if

605
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,959
you saw a role and it was high tech, you might be more attracted to go for that.

606
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,599
It's probably higher salary as well, as opposed to if it was a high salary, but

607
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:08,559
low tech role, you know, so, so maybe we're on, we're our own worst enemies.

608
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,239
Yeah.

609
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:13,120
But on, on the other hand, you could, you could see like, especially, but what I

610
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,279
saw in, in, in last decade were like those, those jobs that have this fancy

611
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,800
descriptions, what kind of technology you'll be using, but in the end you're

612
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,879
like stuck with some legacy, like they maybe have something in a roadmap.

613
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,480
We want to be there, but you will need the working process, how to get there.

614
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,120
But you're basically stuck with some legacy technology.

615
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,559
I find those kinds of things the most interesting, like for me, I think the,

616
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,919
I'm really interested in, in that how to get from point A to point B.

617
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,000
So if somebody comes along and says, we have this rails application, it's a

618
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,400
monolith, it's just a rails app with a Postgres database, we have an aspiration

619
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,519
to grow the business, to add technology, which will ultimately lead to

620
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,040
developing all of these new services.

621
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,879
I think that's actually really interesting because then you sort of

622
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:09,520
think, well, how do you decompose this?

623
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,199
How do you start extracting components out of this?

624
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,000
What is the appropriate way to run this new architecture?

625
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,880
And you see it grow and you see it involve and hopefully with it, you see

626
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:27,679
the business grow and I think that's always been a focus that we shouldn't

627
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,759
forget that we were employed to help provide a sort of a service to provide

628
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:41,600
a value for an organization and so yeah, so maybe basically we just need more

629
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,039
businesses to like start giving us money based on if they're more successful,

630
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,520
they should pay us more, right?

631
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,360
That sounds fair, right?

632
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,679
I'm all for more money.

633
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,679
So less hype driven hiring.

634
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,720
Yeah, but I think in general, right?

635
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,199
Like I think if you look at DevOps and if you've spoken to certain business

636
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:08,160
leaders, they will use the term and they haven't really got an understanding

637
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,360
of what's going on, but they don't really get it, but even if that term is a

638
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,360
leverage to be able to drive a conversation in finance, to be able to drive

639
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:27,320
a conversation with a C-level somewhere, which increases funding for technology

640
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,639
or for whatever that the organization then needs to help it push forward,

641
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,600
then that's a good thing.

642
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:43,039
Like I've got no problem at all with that if somebody's kind of using that,

643
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,520
but because we all win in the end.

644
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,119
Yeah.

645
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,880
Do you think that maybe in the next few years we will...

646
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:59,199
In the recent years, there had been a lot of tooling regarding delivery and

647
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:01,520
how to ship something to production.

648
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:09,839
And I would say that back in the 2000s, there were, including me, a lot of

649
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,839
sysadmins that were happy with just like simple best scripts.

650
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,640
And we didn't really care much with coding back then.

651
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:24,279
Of course, at least I was less experienced, so you need to grow that skill of coding.

652
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,679
And now we are in a renaissance where there's a lot of new tools popping up.

653
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:36,559
And I compare that, and I know it's a weird comparison, a bit to the front end

654
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,440
world, when there was a period that there had been a lot of frameworks, but now we

655
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,799
are basically settled on the three major ones, kind of.

656
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,040
Of course, there are newer ones, but there's React, Vue.js, and Angular, and

657
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,920
they seem to be the options that big companies pick.

658
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,839
Do you think that maybe we will agree on some tooling in some departments so we

659
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,559
will be able to be more rational and then think back how to provide more value and

660
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,079
just not hack on new things?

661
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,839
I think it's a good question.

662
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:20,320
And I think until we get to a situation when the tooling is really suitable for

663
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,760
what we need in order to do our jobs, we're going to, I think, still have evolution.

664
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:35,200
I think there is a slow sort of standardization around sort of certain

665
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,399
tools, which I think is a good thing because then you have a sort of a, you

666
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:44,519
know, the knowledge sharing is kind of more focused, which is always good.

667
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:53,279
But I'm still not convinced that where we are right now, that the tools deliver

668
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,200
exactly what we need, and that's why we need to continually build things.

669
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,959
And again, like this is why I think that every organization has a platform

670
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:06,600
engineering team, because there isn't something that we can just pick up off

671
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,119
the shelf and that we can use.

672
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,200
And so I think there will be a consolidation.

673
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:19,399
I think it will kind of happen, but it seems like certainly from over the last

674
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:24,320
sort of five years, you know, from an architectural standpoint where we're not

675
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,440
slowing down, but we seem to be organizing our thought around the two predominant

676
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,440
patterns of like either the serverless pattern or the kind of the Kubernetes

677
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,359
or scheduler-based pattern, that doesn't seem to be, there's certainly nobody's

678
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,200
come up with a new, well, having said that, and I'm like, well, we're all going

679
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,480
to be probably writing serverless WASM functions running on Kubernetes,

680
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,600
obviously in the next five years.

681
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,200
So maybe we are about to shift again, but it does feel like we're starting to

682
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,519
consolidate our infrastructure patterns.

683
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,880
And then I think because of that, the tooling will then become standardized.

684
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,799
So I think it'll happen.

685
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:11,160
But I think there's always, whilst we're all building our own platforms,

686
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,200
there's always going to be custom tooling required because what I build

687
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,679
is not necessarily going to be useful for you or you or...

688
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:29,320
Yeah, but like we can simply, like basically your employers, so HashiCorp,

689
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,320
so basically was solving some of their own issues and create tools to figure

690
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,799
out those tools could benefit to a wide range of customers.

691
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:46,480
And I'm excited about that.

692
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,640
And like, so I don't know if any of the listeners haven't kind of got a full

693
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,600
background on that, but when Mitchell and Armand basically were working in a role

694
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,839
as DevOps engineers and they were deploying systems and they realized kind

695
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,519
of the forefront of cloud, that the tooling was, there was something missing basically.

696
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,320
Now this is just after Vagrant.

697
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,679
So they started to kind of think about this and started to build the tooling.

698
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,279
And then they realized that actually, hang on a minute, if this tooling is useful

699
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,679
for us, then it's probably useful for the wider market.

700
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:30,600
And then that was when they founded HashiCorp to actually start working on that full time.

701
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,679
And back then you were looking at sort of Vagrant and Terraform and Packer.

702
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,440
And then HashiCorp built the first version of Terraform Cloud, which was then called Atlas.

703
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,400
And we needed a secrets manager.

704
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,400
So there wasn't a secrets manager.

705
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,719
Internally, they were like, well, we need to build this secrets service.

706
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,200
So they built Vault.

707
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,440
And then after Vault had been built, which was specifically designed just for the first

708
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,359
version of Terraform Cloud, somebody was like, hang on a minute, that's actually really useful.

709
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,559
We should make that a tool for other people to use.

710
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,440
And I think having that ethos has been really, really useful.

711
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,039
So I hope that we'll see a lot more companies that do exactly the same thing.

712
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:20,080
You know, it might be some engineers who are working for an organization and they built

713
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,200
a really useful tool.

714
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,919
Then they go and they set up a startup and they can build that tool and work on it and

715
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,960
allow, you know, it solves the problem for everyone else.

716
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,719
I think that's a really nice way of developing software, rather than, you know, the kind

717
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:42,280
of the just sitting around thinking about what should we build.

718
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,239
When you've got an actual need, which is based on knowledge of the problem, I think you create

719
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,760
really, really good software.

720
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,239
And I think I'm hopeful we'll see a lot more of that.

721
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:04,919
We saw this sort of good practices in the past, like the company, like my top of my

722
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:11,919
mind right now is maybe like Netflix, open source, their Chaos Monkey project and so

723
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:12,919
on.

724
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:21,320
So basically each company is sort of a development in its own tooling for suiting their needs

725
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,119
and figure out, well, maybe somebody else is having similar problems.

726
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,119
Yeah.

727
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,119
Let's work on this.

728
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:35,520
And I see a lot of nice open source software or tools came out of that and sort of a community

729
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,640
growth out of that and people contributed to this.

730
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,200
So it seems like a lot's been going on in that sense.

731
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Yeah.

732
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,640
And I think like in general, that whole sort of change in the way that we share information

733
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,760
has been like huge from, I remember when I was at university and I was studying university,

734
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,239
I needed Linux.

735
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,559
And back in the day, you didn't have much of a modem, right?

736
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:09,919
But I had to, I bought a book, a textbook from a bookstore and it came with a CD of,

737
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,359
I think it was Suze.

738
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,239
And that was how I got access to Linux.

739
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,520
If I needed some software, I would generally have to pay for it.

740
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,840
So like I needed, I'm working on an application and the application needed to do some very

741
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,359
basic image manipulation.

742
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:35,520
Like I'm talking cropping and now I could have wrote that myself, but at the same time,

743
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
the internet didn't exist.

744
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,719
So like determining how, what is the specification of a JPEG, right?

745
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
What is the JPEG specification?

746
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,039
What's the file format?

747
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,840
The actual software frameworks at the time, certainly like ASP.net didn't have that capability

748
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,799
built in.

749
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:58,039
So it would be a huge amount of effort to try and even do something very, very simple,

750
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,960
like create a JPEG resizer.

751
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,960
And there was no free software to do this.

752
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,960
So you had to go and buy a library, which was great for the folks who were selling the

753
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,760
libraries, but it meant that everything just went really quite slow.

754
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,039
You know, you didn't have the ability to accumulate knowledge.

755
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:22,440
And then of course, when organizations, I think started to get and realize that we've

756
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,700
got this learning, we've consumed some learning from other people.

757
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,599
So let's put back into the industry and share our learning and creating a sort of an open

758
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,440
software model.

759
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,919
It's just benefiting absolutely everywhere because now we've got the access to the knowledge.

760
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:47,119
We obviously have access to the tools and to the organizations like Netflix, like for

761
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:55,719
Netflix to publish their Chaos Monkey is of zero competitive disadvantage to them as a

762
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,359
video platform.

763
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,760
And I think a lot of organizations are kind of recognizing that same thing.

764
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:05,919
And I think we're all benefiting hugely, hugely from that.

765
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,119
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

766
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:23,440
Like one thing that I really value about HashiCorp is whatever product was released, it was super

767
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,239
well engineered and designed.

768
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:37,760
And I think that a lot of solutions were also solving problems in the most smooth way that

769
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
you could solve it.

770
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,960
I remember maybe we should just mention a few products, because when I was a youngster,

771
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,200
I didn't realize that Vagrant was a HashiCorp product.

772
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,080
And then when there was the era where we were building gold images for virtual machines

773
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,239
in the cloud, there was this Packer.

774
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:08,159
And then after a while, I started focusing, you know, if there is a great director, you

775
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,719
see a movie and then you're like, OK, that's a great movie.

776
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,840
And then you see another movie and you're like, OK, that's also a great movie.

777
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,799
And then you're like, oh, but the director is the same, right?

778
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:17,299
Right.

779
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:25,460
And then I started being more focused on the company and whatever products they offer.

780
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,179
And for example, I was always confused.

781
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,580
I know that Nomad is here for a while.

782
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,419
It was here before containers arrived, I think.

783
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,460
Around about the same.

784
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:39,960
Yeah.

785
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:46,580
Both Nomad and Kubernetes were probably started around about exactly the same time.

786
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:56,020
So it was just post-Docker and when we were kind of starting to consume like Mesos, which

787
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:02,419
was the most popular scheduler at the time, and kind of wondering if there were other

788
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:08,580
options, certainly that was where Mitchell and Armon were thinking when they decided

789
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,739
to create Nomad.

790
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,700
And I'm pretty sure that's where like Joe Bader and all were thinking when they started

791
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,059
to think about Kubernetes.

792
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:24,179
Do you maybe have an idea why Nomad was not picked as much as maybe some different products

793
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:25,059
from HashiCorp?

794
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:26,979
I think it's...

795
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,059
Is it too simple?

796
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:29,940
No, I don't think so.

797
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,700
Like, I think it's an interesting one.

798
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,340
I mean, I suppose, I think one of the...

799
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:42,500
Well, so if we look at it in terms of timelines, I remember way back and we were talking about

800
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,820
replacing Mesos and we wanted to adopt something else.

801
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:53,380
Now, the first time I ever saw Armon, I was speaking at a conference in London and he

802
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,659
was speaking there talking about Nomad.

803
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:57,940
And so I went to...

804
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,179
I was a HashiCorp fan.

805
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:02,900
We were using a lot of their tools at Not On The High Street.

806
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,099
So I went to see this talk because I wanted to know what this new scheduler was.

807
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,419
And at the time it was just the initial alpha release.

808
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:11,539
It looked really interesting.

809
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,020
And Kubernetes at the time was...

810
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,299
There was this whole thing about, oh, you shouldn't be running it in production.

811
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:18,419
It's not ready for production.

812
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:21,219
And there were rough edges as there always are with software.

813
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:28,580
I think the thing that maybe HashiCorp had against it when...

814
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:34,419
And in terms of like, if you want to look at that as a race of some sort, was that the

815
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:38,099
team at HashiCorp that were working on Nomad probably back then were probably about two

816
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,059
or three people.

817
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:44,419
And then you have the entire organization and the weight of Google.

818
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:52,979
But I think the key thing around those two things is that folks gravitated to one solution.

819
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:56,020
Then you have sort of an ecosystem that spins up around that.

820
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,140
And then that accelerates that sort of drive.

821
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,340
I think Nomad never really got too much in that.

822
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,420
I still think it's a fabulous scheduler and it would probably be my primary choice because

823
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,020
I love the fact that it's so versatile.

824
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,939
And it is, I wouldn't say...

825
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,140
In some ways, it's easier to use.

826
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,260
In some ways, it's more complex.

827
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,859
I think there's pros and cons to everything.

828
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:25,859
But I think it was literally just a thing that people just sort of said, look, I just

829
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:27,300
want to run containers.

830
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,579
Then Kubernetes and then all of the...

831
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,540
If you Google how to run a container, you're going to get Kubernetes.

832
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,579
It's just a snowball.

833
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:37,939
I don't think Nomad is done by any real odds though.

834
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:42,420
I think Nomad's been there for probably about seven years now.

835
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,140
And I think keep your eyes on it because I think we're kind of working on some really

836
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,819
cool stuff and the versatility of having the capability to schedule multiple different

837
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:58,660
things, VMs, ECS tasks, if you want, Docker containers, raw binaries.

838
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,619
JAR files.

839
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,660
JAR files, of course.

840
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,060
I mean, if you're running Java, if you're like, do you really need to containerize your

841
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,939
Java applications?

842
00:43:05,939 --> 00:43:07,859
Well, if you're running kube, the answer is yes.

843
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,099
But the thing is you don't.

844
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:19,219
And yeah, so I think that versatility could actually be really interesting for when we

845
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:23,219
look at the post-container generation, which I don't think is very far away.

846
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:31,459
So, but yeah, I think it was literally just the, you know, it was appetite in the community.

847
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,180
People gravitated towards a particular product.

848
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,500
Still a lot of users use Nomad, don't get me wrong.

849
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,819
But of course, it's not as big as the sort of Kubernetes, but they do different things

850
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:43,619
in different ways.

851
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,180
I suppose it's whatever your choice is.

852
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:52,420
Is it like, based on what you're seeing, is there like the product of HashiCorp that is

853
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:58,500
like far more popular or saying, well, this is our most popular or most used product?

854
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,219
I know all of them are in the whole.

855
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:03,300
I mean, without a shadow of a doubt, Terraform.

856
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:11,219
I mean, I think literally without a shadow, I mean, even if you look at the simplest of

857
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:20,180
metrics around GitHub stars, it's far out, out sort of ways, any of the other tools.

858
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,939
I mean, I don't, like I was asking somebody for numbers on this the other day because

859
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:27,459
I've heard some things.

860
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,140
It's definitely in millions.

861
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
Like I've heard quotes of the 10 millions.

862
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:38,579
I think we've had, they just had a billion downloads of the Terraform AWS provider, which

863
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,500
is pretty, pretty crazy.

864
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,180
And you don't have to go too far.

865
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:48,260
It gets mentioned a lot.

866
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,540
I mean, when people are talking about things like provisioning infrastructure, creating

867
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,819
infrastructure, even deploying applications, it comes up a lot.

868
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:57,699
So it's definitely very, very popular.

869
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,219
And I like it as a tool as well.

870
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:04,020
I mean, I'm slightly biased, of course, but yeah, probably that.

871
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:08,099
In terms of like, what's the second most popular?

872
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:15,780
I mean, your console is still powering huge, huge, huge, huge, huge part of the internet.

873
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:21,540
There are some large, large numbers of console clusters running.

874
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,500
And at one point I, and please don't quote me on this, but I'm sure I read a statistic

875
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,699
that it was one of the most deployed applications to things like AWS, because it was like a

876
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,699
core part of people's microservices state.

877
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,979
Where that goes with Kubernetes, because obviously Kube has etcd built into it.

878
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,140
Will we see a shift?

879
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,060
Possibly, but at the same time, console has shifted.

880
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:50,500
You know, console has additional capabilities around sort of macro segmentation service

881
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,459
mesh capabilities to bring it into the new world.

882
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,500
So it's not gone.

883
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,619
And then there's Vault.

884
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:04,660
And Vault is, I think, I don't want to say like it is becoming a sort of an industry

885
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:12,579
standard for secrets management, but it's certainly one of the more mentioned tools

886
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:16,099
when people are looking for a secrets management solution.

887
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:22,579
I can add that you basically set some goals or some standards regarding Vault, because

888
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:27,140
I personally tried different, or let's say alternative products.

889
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,939
And in the end, they tried to have the same API or say API calls as you guys did.

890
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:39,459
So to have this transparency and being able to switch to something different.

891
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,140
Interesting.

892
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:49,219
I was thinking, I'm surprised that Vagrant is not among first three, because whenever

893
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:58,260
I joined any developer teams, I saw that like Vagrant is there.

894
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:05,300
Maybe they didn't know about it, but somehow some things are basically running in Vagrant.

895
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,540
I would, you know, I'm going to look up the numbers on this, but I know that Vagrant is

896
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,140
still wildly popular.

897
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,540
So, and as well for me, Vagrant was the first HashiCorp tool that I ever used.

898
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:25,060
At the time I was working at a UK supermarket and we were wanting to run functional tests

899
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,219
for our iOS application and our Android applications.

900
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:33,859
And this needed massive parallelization and we needed the capability of running a clean

901
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:35,060
room environment.

902
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,380
We didn't want to be installing software on top of software.

903
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:42,180
Now, specifically for Apple, and this is, you know, we're going back nearly 10 years

904
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:47,540
now, there was no way to kind of just virtualize an OS X instance.

905
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,979
You could spin up OS X on an OS X, I'm sorry, on an Apple machine using VMware.

906
00:47:54,099 --> 00:48:03,380
So what we did was we used Vagrant to basically spin up in these virtual machines on Apple

907
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,900
hardware, which was pre-configured.

908
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,699
Then we could run, use this to execute our functional tests.

909
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:12,339
And we were kind of orchestrating all of that with Jenkins.

910
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:13,859
And it worked great.

911
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:18,819
Like, you know, long before any of the sort of the, there was any sort of CI-based platforms

912
00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:19,380
to do this.

913
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:21,699
And that was my introduction to Vagrant.

914
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:27,140
So then I started to use it for building development machines.

915
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,819
But at the same time, I also discovered things like Docker.

916
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:37,380
And for me, like the, if I just needed a post-grid database, which I mostly did for my

917
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,180
my development work or something along those lines, spinning that up in Docker was incredibly

918
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:42,500
fast.

919
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:47,699
But Vagrant is hugely, hugely popular.

920
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:53,300
When I joined HashiCorp nearly seven years ago, and we were talking about my role as

921
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:59,780
a kind of an advocate and the tooling that, and I remember the sort of, Armand was kind

922
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,099
of saying, well, look, you know, Vagrant is not really something as we talk about as developer

923
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:11,140
advocates because the community is just so vast that it kind of is self-fulfilling, which

924
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:11,780
is incredible.

925
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,219
I mean, it's absolutely amazing.

926
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:17,060
So yeah, Vagrant, Vagrant is still pretty big.

927
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,339
Like, I don't know on the numbers, I don't know, but you're probably right.

928
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:24,739
There's a huge amount of Vagrant still going on around there.

929
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:27,780
I think if you don't use Docker for stuff, you're probably using Vagrant.

930
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:35,380
Before we go to the next question or next topic, I would like to thank our supporters

931
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,660
on Patreon that help us produce this.

932
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:46,020
So there is some cost with production of this podcast from audio to video.

933
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:52,180
So I would like to thank our Patreons and our two sponsors, two companies are sponsoring

934
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:58,500
this, or our supporters, and that's 3FS and Human Frog.

935
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,480
So, thank you for that.

936
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:12,200
Um, yeah, my question would be, I was, I was having a presentation earlier

937
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:20,719
today, um, at the conference and I was so surprised how Terraform really

938
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:29,000
got popular in our region, um, and how many people know it and how many

939
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,160
people now use it at work.

940
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,799
Um, and I think that that really changed in the last two years.

941
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:41,959
Um, because when I was picking it up, I was more of a lonely rider, super

942
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:48,840
excited, uh, so that I can, um, basically spare some bugs when I go

943
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,279
to lunch because I can destroy the whole, uh, deployment and then reapply

944
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,759
and my lean notes, uh, invoices were coming on 50 pages, uh, built for

945
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:06,239
every minute, two cents, and then just pages and pages of, of VMs.

946
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,080
Uh, and each, each line was just like two cents, two cents, two cents,

947
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,120
because I was creating and destroying, creating, complying and destroying.

948
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:22,080
Um, but I would still like you to explain to more junior folks what

949
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:27,160
Terraform is, and maybe I guess there are also some folks listening that

950
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,760
are not super into, um, infrastructure.

951
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,599
Uh, what is this tool?

952
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:38,360
So I think it, it basically allows you to define infrastructure in a declarative way.

953
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,599
So you can create a text file, which defines what a piece of infrastructure

954
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,360
might look like, a load balancer, a virtual machine, a network security

955
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,720
group, those types of things.

956
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:52,879
And you do that in, in a language, HCL, the HashiCorp configuration language,

957
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:57,839
which is, is kind of a, I always think of it as if, if, if Jason and Yaml

958
00:51:57,879 --> 00:52:01,519
had got together and had a child, HCL would be that child.

959
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,720
But it's a beautiful child.

960
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:04,519
It's a very, it's a very pretty child.

961
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:04,720
Yeah.

962
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,199
It's like, um, I'm trying to think of like, you know, Brad Pitt and who else?

963
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,960
Anyway, but, but by doing that, what, what you get is the

964
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,360
ability to define infrastructure.

965
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,360
Now, what I think is important about Terraform is, is not so much the

966
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,960
declaration, I think the declaration has been done before, but I think what's,

967
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,000
what's clever about Terraform is the fact that it uses a graph.

968
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,399
So it's graph based.

969
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,320
So you can basically say that the output, for example, from a virtual

970
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,759
machine, which might have the output of a, uh, a private IP address can

971
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:41,399
be the input into another resource.

972
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:43,320
So for example, a load balancer.

973
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,199
And because of that graph base, what it means is that when you do your,

974
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,759
your sort of your Terraform apply, Terraform works out the order in

975
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:53,199
which it needs to create resources.

976
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,520
So it knows that it can't create the load balancer until the

977
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,520
private IP is available, which means it needs to create the virtual machine first.

978
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:07,279
So it like that actually helps a lot because it means that you no longer need

979
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:12,919
to kind of have those exceptions or, um, or things the, the other benefit is where

980
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,279
you can parallelize things to say you're creating 30 virtual machines.

981
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,160
You don't need to do them in sequential order.

982
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:24,039
Terraform can basically go, well, I'm going to create 30 at once,

983
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,600
which, which reduces the time.

984
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,240
So I think those are the, for me, those things that were like

985
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,479
brilliant when I started using it.

986
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,119
I think where I appreciate it moving forward as well is the feedback

987
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,279
loop that Terraform gives me.

988
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:39,919
So it will tell me what has changed.

989
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:44,240
And I think that, that again is, is kind of the difference of when they

990
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,360
were building the tool out the thing, right?

991
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:46,600
Okay.

992
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,279
Things needed to be graph based because we needed this, this dependency, but

993
00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:54,279
we also need to give feedback because we want to understand what has changed.

994
00:53:54,279 --> 00:53:59,039
I don't want to just wipe out my infrastructure every time I do an apply.

995
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:01,479
I don't want to kind of do this additive update.

996
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:06,520
I want to, I want to be very prescriptive on, on, um, those changes, what's changed

997
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,880
and understanding what's changed, which, which helps you to not make mistakes,

998
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:14,399
which is always a, a benefit.

999
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:19,799
And I think for those reasons is why it's been very, very popular for me as well.

1000
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,040
Like, I think it's the accessibility.

1001
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,600
So like I, Terraform is the tool that led me to apply for a job at HashiCorp.

1002
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:29,559
Even though I was using Vagrant, I was using console at the

1003
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:31,480
time, uh, and some Packer, I think.

1004
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:38,559
But I was working as a developer and I wanted to deploy an application service.

1005
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:42,679
So I went to see our DevOps team and I'm like, look, I want to deploy this, this

1006
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,119
service, it was actually a Lambda and the team were like, well, we know nothing

1007
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:51,440
about Lambda, but we had a good DevOps culture, so they're like, look, if, if

1008
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,440
you can figure this out and you can help us understand what's going on here and

1009
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,000
you can do it in a way that kind of adheres to our principles, which is

1010
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,920
everything must be version control and CICG driven, then we will support

1011
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,559
you on, on, on whatever you want to do.

1012
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,760
And I thought that's brilliant.

1013
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:09,959
Right.

1014
00:55:10,279 --> 00:55:12,320
So I went away and I looked at a number of different tools.

1015
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,239
They were using Ansible.

1016
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,440
I couldn't figure out Ansible.

1017
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,880
I mean, it, um, you know, I was, I'm kind of looking at a very, I'd used

1018
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,600
Chef before and I kind of got Chef, but at the same time, when I'm doing my

1019
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,440
research, I came across this thing called Terraform and, and I'm like immediately

1020
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,480
Terraform had the capability for me to deploy this Lambda.

1021
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,600
And I figured it out literally in a, um, in an evening when I was just sitting on

1022
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,279
the sofa working, uh, watching TV with my wife and that was, you know, it just

1023
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:41,880
resonated.

1024
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,480
So then I took that back to, to the team and they're like, well, we don't use

1025
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,640
Terraform, we use Ansible.

1026
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,119
But again, we had this agreement.

1027
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,760
It was like, well, if it's simple enough, we can understand it and you understand

1028
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,720
it and you're happy, then we can come to a compromise.

1029
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,880
And that, that for me, when I was actually looking through that Terraform

1030
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,399
documentation and working through that role, and at the time I was, I wasn't so

1031
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:06,600
happy in my current role.

1032
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,920
It was, there were organizational challenges, which, which was like sad

1033
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,119
because I loved the team and I loved the work, but there was a little link at the

1034
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,160
bottom of the Terraform documentation, which is like, come work at HashiCorp.

1035
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,679
And I remember sitting and complaining to my wife and she said, look, why don't

1036
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:22,559
you just go find a new job?

1037
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:25,119
And I saw this link at the bottom of the Terraform documentation because I've

1038
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,799
been working on how to deploy my Lambda and I clicked on it and there was a role

1039
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,000
for a developer advocate based in the US.

1040
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,760
So I filled in the form and I sent off an email and I said, Hey, look, I live in

1041
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,200
London, but I can move to the US or can you possibly move the rule to, to London?

1042
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,279
Well, seven years later, I'm, I'm still there, but I'm very fond of Terraform.

1043
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:47,200
Yeah.

1044
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:54,880
Maybe I can add a bit like, I knew about Terraform and then I tried it

1045
00:56:54,959 --> 00:57:03,000
out and I don't know, that was yeah, a few years back and I really upped my game.

1046
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,119
So I would say like, if you're interested in infrastructure,

1047
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,160
you really need to learn it.

1048
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:19,839
And for me as a independent consultant, I need to try out a lot of stuff.

1049
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:28,000
So I don't move somewhere and I don't, I don't get super familiarized into AWS,

1050
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,119
into specific services that a company might use.

1051
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:42,760
So I want to maintain a broad knowledge of everything that is there, but I also

1052
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,799
want to dive in so much that I can deliver.

1053
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:55,480
And for me having, so Terraform comes with providers, which implement

1054
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:02,920
different cloud providers, and the documentation of all the resources in

1055
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:11,119
Terraform are kind of documented in a standard way because they just document

1056
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,799
the resources themselves.

1057
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:20,480
And for me nowadays, it's so much easier to try out different clouds, just like

1058
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,600
move around, just like use DigitalOcean, use Vultr, use Linode for my smaller

1059
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,239
companies, and then all the three big clouds for other customers.

1060
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,799
And it really, really helped me out.

1061
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,960
And I also didn't have this bad feeling, you know, when I came to the office and

1062
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,320
then I click around the dashboard the whole day, right?

1063
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,239
And then I was like, cool, this is well, kind of expensive, right?

1064
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,520
It will cost me probably, I don't know, 40 euros a day, but I don't want to delete

1065
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,880
everything right now because tomorrow morning I will have to do the same drill.

1066
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:59,239
And if you're clicking through a UI to do that, then you might

1067
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:01,000
not be able to reproduce it.

1068
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:03,080
And I think this is a key thing as well.

1069
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,880
Like when people are saying like, well, why should we bother using infrastructure

1070
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,559
as code, I can click a button to create my Kubernetes cluster, I can click some

1071
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:12,880
more buttons to set up the load balancer and the security rules and stuff like that.

1072
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:14,080
And that's great.

1073
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,440
But what if somebody comes in and deletes your project?

1074
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:25,080
And it was like to my buddy, Eric and I, we did a, we were doing a talk on

1075
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:30,520
Terraform for DigitalOcean a few years back, and the premise was all about using

1076
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,960
Terraform to provision DigitalOcean clusters.

1077
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,679
And so we're setting all of this up and we built everything up in Terraform.

1078
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:40,760
And Eric said, Hey, can you, we had a couple of clusters.

1079
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,599
He's like, can you delete this, this cluster?

1080
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,520
So I went into the UI and I just clicked a button and I just, I deleted the wrong

1081
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,119
cluster, so I actually wiped out our main infrastructure cluster and like, and I'm

1082
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:59,080
like, um, yeah, Eric, I've just deleted the production infrastructure and he's

1083
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,400
like, well, that was stupid.

1084
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,440
And I'm like, well, yeah.

1085
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:02,400
Well, what do you expect?

1086
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:07,039
Anyway, the, but this was kind of going into the talk and then I'm like, but hang

1087
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,440
on though, we've already defined this with Terraform, so Terraform apply.

1088
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:16,280
Five minutes later, it was all back up, you know, and, and this was, it was kind

1089
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,320
of in some ways like, you know, we were doing this talk about why you should use

1090
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,880
infrastructure as code and I'd actually proven the point by doing the thing that

1091
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,679
I was trying to say you shouldn't ever do.

1092
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,159
Yeah.

1093
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,679
And, um, and that was, that was amazing.

1094
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,359
The ability to basically always reproduce what you've, you've created just by

1095
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,960
running this, this, um, this one command, this Terraform apply or tear it down

1096
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,880
again, being able to remove everything so you can save money because it's not just

1097
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,359
production infrastructure that we've got.

1098
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,960
We've got test environments, thousands of dev environments, thousands of test

1099
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,400
environments, prod, pre-prod, like depending on the size of the organization,

1100
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,640
a lot of, a lot of things.

1101
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,119
If you can define that declaratively and you can be a hundred percent certain,

1102
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,599
nigh on a hundred percent certain that when you do Terraform apply, you get

1103
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,559
exactly what you had the last time.

1104
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:11,960
Then with safety, you can tear stuff down and you can start saving,

1105
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,960
saving money and saving resources.

1106
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,039
But it also helps with experimentation.

1107
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:20,559
And I think this is like core to the ethos of where HashiCorp are thinking

1108
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,640
with things like Terraform and things like Packer about the, you might've

1109
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,479
heard the term cattle, not pets.

1110
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:29,640
I, um, I think it's, it's cool, right?

1111
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,440
It's like, so rather than having this additive process where you install

1112
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,440
software on top of software, what you do is you create something brand new,

1113
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,679
which has that combination stack and you throw the old stuff away.

1114
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:44,719
And the reason for that is that it's reproducible.

1115
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,559
It's not always reproducible to recreate the layers.

1116
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,559
Um, if, if you've done that as in a sort of a layered approach, because

1117
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,200
software packages change, um, software packages may be unavailable.

1118
01:01:58,239 --> 01:01:59,719
There may be an outage.

1119
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,760
Like what happens if there's an outage on apt and you don't have like a, you

1120
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,159
know, a, a sort of a cache when you're trying to draw, deploy some production

1121
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:10,719
infrastructure in the middle of an outage or you're in trouble.

1122
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:11,559
Yeah.

1123
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,479
But, but if you take the kind of the declarative approach with Packer and

1124
01:02:14,479 --> 01:02:19,159
you've got these baked images, then it doesn't remove the risk.

1125
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:24,640
It reduces the, the kind of the risk and increases, um, speed as well.

1126
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,640
So I think it's a great tool.

1127
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,280
Like I'm, uh, I, I completely agree.

1128
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:37,919
And I'll ask the, like for the audience or the, the, the, the, the, let's say

1129
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:45,520
CIS admins who are the companies that are not yet using Terraform or not at, um,

1130
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:47,919
trying to define their infrastructure as code.

1131
01:02:48,919 --> 01:02:54,280
Uh, there's this question of how to introduce Terraform once you

1132
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,000
already have something deployed.

1133
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,119
So once like the production is already there.

1134
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,719
So this is like the most common use case, what to do, because Terraform

1135
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,280
is great for greenfield deployment for deploying something new for

1136
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:07,760
starting from scratch.

1137
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,359
Awesome.

1138
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah.

1139
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:13,799
What to do in cases when like there's so much legacy in production.

1140
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,880
Well, how to introduce, you have any, any bits and tricks, how to,

1141
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,520
how to, um, do this kind of shift?

1142
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:22,960
Yeah.

1143
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,080
So it, I mean, it's always been possible to Terraformify.

1144
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:27,799
Is that, I probably created a thing.

1145
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:29,479
Like if marketing are watching, I'm sorry.

1146
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,320
Um, but Terraformify is now a thing.

1147
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:36,599
Um, it has always been possible to turn existing infrastructure into

1148
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,159
Terraform because there's always been the, the import command.

1149
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:43,119
The problem that's always been with the import command is it would

1150
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,799
just bring in the state.

1151
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:49,239
So for folks who are not familiar with Terraform, you've got this

1152
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:54,599
concept of state, which defines what exists and then your Terraform

1153
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:56,239
configuration is what will be.

1154
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:01,520
Now, when you've got an existing resource, you need

1155
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,440
configuration and you need state.

1156
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,000
So the import command would just create the state, which meant you then had to

1157
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,119
go and write the, you know, you had to go and write the, the HCL for each of

1158
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,000
those things, which matched the state.

1159
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,679
And it was, I mean, it was possible.

1160
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:20,000
I mean, you could automate it in some aspects, but it was, it was time-consuming.

1161
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,919
It was a bit of a, it was a bit of a chore and there was tooling.

1162
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,400
Um, I think it was Terraform, it was going to be like a Google project, which,

1163
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,520
which could kind of do with some of this stuff, but what we did in the last

1164
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,880
release of, um, Terraform, which just came out this summer is we've

1165
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,679
updated the, the import command.

1166
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:44,559
So now you can actually define an import stanza, point it to an

1167
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,200
existing resource in your cloud.

1168
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:49,919
And what Terraform will do is it will both import the state and

1169
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,640
it will generate the HCL for you.

1170
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:57,679
So you, you know, you can take even large existing pieces of infrastructure

1171
01:04:58,039 --> 01:04:59,559
and start kind of pulling them in.

1172
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:03,080
So you can start managing them with, with Terraform, which, which

1173
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,239
I think is a good step forward.

1174
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:06,239
And again, this isn't an early stage feature.

1175
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:07,919
It was only, only this summer.

1176
01:05:07,919 --> 01:05:09,799
And there's a lot more to do with that.

1177
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:13,400
And, and of course people like to modularize things.

1178
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,799
So it, it's not going to figure all of that out for you, but it, it's

1179
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,719
definitely better than having to like hand, hand roll all of this stuff.

1180
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,080
So I think you can do it.

1181
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,760
Um, and I think there's, I think it's worth doing, but, but I think

1182
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,640
like, should you, should you do everything?

1183
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:33,520
I mean, as an exercise that could be expensive.

1184
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,400
So maybe what you've got to look at is what is changing all of the time?

1185
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,760
Like, so if for example, you've got 20 servers and only one of them changes,

1186
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,760
maybe just the important thing is just to Terraform that one, that one server.

1187
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,400
Uh, it doesn't have to be an exercise where it's all or nothing, but, but I

1188
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,400
definitely think there is a benefit that wherever there is change that you, if

1189
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:01,520
you manage that change with Terraform, you are reducing your, your risk, um,

1190
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,320
because of the, the, the knowledge you get from the, the change diffs.

1191
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,840
Um, but again, that, that reproducibility, that consistency, the, the ability to

1192
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,559
recreate something, if somebody goes into your production and clicks the big red

1193
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:21,200
button and then just blindly copies the delete thing into the box, and then

1194
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:24,039
realizes that that was actually the wrong account that they've done it in.

1195
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:25,200
And they've just deleted the production.

1196
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,119
That's a great disaster recovery exercise.

1197
01:06:29,479 --> 01:06:30,359
That's how we learn.

1198
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:31,760
I mean, right.

1199
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:32,080
Yeah.

1200
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,039
If, if, if you did your homework, right.

1201
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:39,080
And, uh, the, the, the Terraform, uh, like it's, it's written correctly.

1202
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:41,559
Like this is one way to, to actually test it.

1203
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,080
Yeah.

1204
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,559
And I think that's the nice thing, right?

1205
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:47,359
Like, so when you, you, you have this common workflow, the there's so many

1206
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,719
Terraform will work with multiple clouds.

1207
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,159
It doesn't like, if you can know how to, the resource standard for

1208
01:06:55,159 --> 01:07:00,159
defining virtual machine in AWS is different to the one in GCP.

1209
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:01,919
And in Azure and in DigitalOcean.

1210
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,359
Subtle differences because each of those clouds have got different

1211
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,079
features and capabilities, but the thing is around the workflow.

1212
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:13,160
If you understand the workflow, if you understand how Terraform plan, how it

1213
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,400
apply works, how destroy works, how you define resources and you can create

1214
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,560
variables and modularization and, and then the, the, the kind of the

1215
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,680
workflow of automating that.

1216
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,560
So using Terraform within multiple environments, um, and doing automated

1217
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,479
deploys, when you get good at that, what it means is that you can, your

1218
01:07:33,479 --> 01:07:37,160
disaster recovery is potentially getting tested every time you do a build.

1219
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:43,040
So if you do a build to dev, you're also kind of testing the Terraform code,

1220
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,640
which is going to deploy your products.

1221
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,479
And so you'll, you'll catch things that maybe I'm using a, an out of date

1222
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:52,400
schema, or maybe there's a configuration problem.

1223
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:59,479
Um, so it, I think it, it just massively reduces the, your risk and gives you

1224
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:04,199
this, this, this great capability to, to recover in the incident that something

1225
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:08,599
does happen, um, which, which got to be a good thing.

1226
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:10,359
Yeah.

1227
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:10,599
Yeah.

1228
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:11,079
You're right.

1229
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:18,000
Recently, there have been a lot of news about Terraform and a license change.

1230
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:18,319
Yeah.

1231
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:23,000
Um, and yeah, we just want to ask you what's the fuss all about.

1232
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,239
I mean, I think, I think folks are, so there's been the change.

1233
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:31,040
So the change has been that we've, we've, we've relicensed Terraform

1234
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:37,040
core to a BSL license so that that BSL license has certain restrictions on use.

1235
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:41,839
Now the, without kind of going right into the terms of the, the kind of the legal

1236
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:49,640
side of things that the terms of, of kind of the restrictions are that for 99.999999%

1237
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,040
of people who were using Terraform, they can continue to do so.

1238
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,640
And they continue to use it for free without any implications on the license.

1239
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,800
What the, the license change was, was kind of is really where it really starts

1240
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:10,239
restriction is if, for example, say you're building a Terraform cloud, then

1241
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,479
that, that the, the license then starts coming into a force.

1242
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,319
So, because you're in, you're creating a service using Terraform, which is in

1243
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,640
competition to one of, one of HashiCorp's services.

1244
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,479
Now, again, I just want to kind of say that that's not necessarily a, a sort of

1245
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:31,000
a, a pure black or white thing, because we do have the capabilities around license

1246
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,520
exemption.

1247
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,479
So if you're, you know, say for example, you're just, you've got an internal

1248
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:40,640
platform, which is using Terraform and you're, maybe there's a gray area of it.

1249
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,479
You're in a competing business with HashiCorp.

1250
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,680
Can you still use Terraform?

1251
01:09:43,959 --> 01:09:47,959
I mean, I think the answer is probably yes, but in the, the, the licensing folks

1252
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:53,319
will, will, will sort of, will help you out, clarify that.

1253
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,239
So I think a lot of folks were like, well, why did we do it?

1254
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,839
Is this not Megarevil Corp?

1255
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,520
Are we, are we kind of like, you know, are we, are we going

1256
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,920
against the spirit of, of open source?

1257
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:09,640
And, and I think the key thing is that the code is still open now.

1258
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,160
So it is technically always going to be open.

1259
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:18,640
If you want, you can fork Terraform and prior to the, the sort of the BSL

1260
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,119
license change, you can do what you want with, with that code.

1261
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:23,040
It's still the, I think it was MPL or whatever.

1262
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:29,119
So that, and the, the future code will always be publicly available,

1263
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,839
obviously with the, the BSL license.

1264
01:10:30,839 --> 01:10:34,560
So as we add new features to Terraform, that code will be completely

1265
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,880
transparent and available inside of the, the, the, the public repo.

1266
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:43,839
And I can, I just want to add as well, it is sort of vault,

1267
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,439
nomad, console, et cetera.

1268
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:50,680
Now, what we haven't changed on a licensing perspective are

1269
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,160
things like the providers.

1270
01:10:53,839 --> 01:10:59,079
Because the providers are in most instances, not, not actually our code.

1271
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:02,599
So, so for example, the folks at DigitalOcean build their own provider,

1272
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,719
Google contribute to their own providers, as do Microsoft, as do sort of Amazon.

1273
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,400
That, that license hasn't, hasn't changed.

1274
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,439
Like why did we do it?

1275
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,400
I think that's the key thing.

1276
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,599
Like, why would you do this?

1277
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:23,959
I mean, the, the thing is that with, HashiCorp invests and has invested over

1278
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:29,079
the sort of the last sort of 10 years, quite a large amount of money into, into

1279
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:34,359
Terraform, obviously Terraform would nowhere near be as, as, as popular as it

1280
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:39,239
is, if it hadn't been for, for wonderful sort of community contribution, but we

1281
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:46,920
have a huge number of sort of engineers and product engineers, you know, a huge

1282
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,239
amount of support that goes into that.

1283
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:54,000
Which way that we made money from Terraform as a, as an entity, I mean,

1284
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,359
we're, you know, we're a company that was through Terraform, Terraform cloud.

1285
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,000
And the, the kind of, I think the drive around the change is to kind of protect

1286
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,760
that investment, because if we can do that, what it means is we can keep those

1287
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,599
engineers because we don't, you know, we want to keep the engineers and we want

1288
01:12:12,599 --> 01:12:13,920
to keep innovating on Terraform.

1289
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,599
We want to keep putting that knowledge in, we want to keep it as a, as an amazing

1290
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:22,560
tool that most of the community can use, use for free.

1291
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,079
And, and I think that was kind of the, you know, that's the, the, the primary

1292
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:29,520
sort of motive behind the change.

1293
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,760
It's, it's not that we're kind of moving this as a precursor to one day, it's

1294
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,319
just going to be like, Hey, we're going to stop using Terraform and everybody's

1295
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:38,760
being like hoodwinked and you're now going to have to pay us mega dollars to,

1296
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:39,680
to rebuild.

1297
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:41,479
No, no, no, no, not in the slightest.

1298
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,680
It's, it's literally just, we're just trying to protect that investment.

1299
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:49,599
99.999999% of people you have, nothing's changed.

1300
01:12:50,280 --> 01:13:00,199
Um, and the main argument that I like saw from the community is like, this is so

1301
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:09,040
widely defined that like, it's, it's not black and white and it's hard to say.

1302
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:16,079
Uh, and I think this is the, the, why, why everybody in everybody active in, in,

1303
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:22,239
in communities is, is, is sort of a safe now that like HashiCorp is now the evil

1304
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:22,640
corp.

1305
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,439
Yeah.

1306
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:26,800
I mean, I think, you know, we, I, I, I'll be honest with you.

1307
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,079
I think we, you know, we weren't the first people to, to do this.

1308
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:30,599
Um, sure.

1309
01:13:30,599 --> 01:13:34,119
It's been a number of companies who've, who've relicensed open source to protect

1310
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,079
their investments.

1311
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,760
And I, we probably won't be the last either.

1312
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:41,719
I think if, if anything, if there's criticism that we've, we've maybe not

1313
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:45,760
managed the, the information on, on the change, then, you know, we'll, we'll take

1314
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,400
that and, and see if we can do a better job around that.

1315
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,079
I think it is complex because it is quite a, like, I mean, even if you read something

1316
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:58,479
like the NPL or a GPL license, they are, for me, I'm not a legal person.

1317
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,280
It's, it's a, it's a complicated document.

1318
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:08,640
So maybe that is, um, that, that can be confusing that you look at this wall of

1319
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:16,680
text, but, but ultimately the, the, let's say the key thing is that if you're not in

1320
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,040
an organization, which is directly competing against any of HashiCorp

1321
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,520
services, you're unaffected.

1322
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,319
If you're unsure, then I think it's licensing at hashicorp.com.

1323
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:31,800
You can sort of get you in touch with, with somebody, or if you're coming to

1324
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:36,959
HashiConf, we're going to have, um, folks there who will be able to help with

1325
01:14:36,959 --> 01:14:38,959
licensing queries and things like that.

1326
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:42,719
We're more than happy to, to sort of clarify those.

1327
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,079
And I would like to bet that like most of the time it's going to be, you know, you're

1328
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:46,520
fine.

1329
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:51,400
Um, and, and it's certainly nothing we wanted to do deliberately.

1330
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,040
You know, we, we, we didn't want to cause any upset.

1331
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:59,640
It wasn't, um, and I, uh, any, anything sort of malicious or anything like that.

1332
01:14:59,640 --> 01:14:59,800
We.

1333
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,320
We're really just trying to protect the investment so that we can keep

1334
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:10,340
investing and keep, um, keep, keep, keep expanding Terraform's capabilities

1335
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,680
and, and, um, make it a even better and better product and something we can

1336
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,080
use for the next decade as well.

1337
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:24,200
Um, I know if you can maybe like comment now that the community now

1338
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,360
opened, uh, open TF or open TOFU.

1339
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:33,799
Uh, so basically it's a, it's a, it's a fork of, of previous, previous

1340
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,880
version of, of, of Terraform.

1341
01:15:35,919 --> 01:15:38,080
Um, I don't know.

1342
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:38,639
Yeah.

1343
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,720
What, what could we expect?

1344
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,480
Because we, we definitely saw this in, in, in the past.

1345
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:45,000
Yeah.

1346
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:54,320
Um, and, uh, in the end, this kind of fighting, it's not like, it's not good.

1347
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,000
No, of course it doesn't bring any, any, any

1348
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,680
progress.

1349
01:15:58,599 --> 01:16:03,400
No, I mean, so I think, I mean, that was, that was perfectly a legitimate thing.

1350
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,879
And, um, so open TOFU exists.

1351
01:16:06,919 --> 01:16:12,239
Um, it was created by, uh, a few organizations who were obviously

1352
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:17,160
affected by the license, but who also felt strongly about the license change

1353
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,239
and wanted to, to keep things on a, uh, an MPL license.

1354
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,320
Now what that they're, they're obviously doing there, they've created the fork.

1355
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,199
They will then create a distribution, um, and a registry and all of those

1356
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:36,000
sorts of things, which, um, are in line with, with the sort of the license.

1357
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,720
I don't know what the future will hold.

1358
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,199
It, um, it's, it's difficult to kind of, to say like, will one win out?

1359
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:49,720
Will we end up with, with the sort of the, like Jenkins Hudson or something

1360
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,279
along those lines, I just don't know.

1361
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:57,080
Like all I can say is that as an organization, HashiCorp is 1000%

1362
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,919
committed to creating Terraform as the best tool that we can offer the industry

1363
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:07,720
to be able to create the best support and services, um, around it.

1364
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:11,160
And, and that we're going to sort of continue to do that.

1365
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:17,320
Does it mean that sort of, um, providers will kind of dry up and disappear then?

1366
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,679
You know, I mean, very possibly, right.

1367
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:22,360
Some, some, some, some people might determine that they're no longer wants

1368
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,199
to, to create a provider for Terraform.

1369
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,279
Some people might say they don't want to create a provider for OpenTofu.

1370
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,559
Some people might end up creating both and having to support the two.

1371
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:37,160
So it's, um, I guess, you know, we just, it's, it's early days.

1372
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:41,600
Like, I mean, we, we just have to wait and see, wait and see how

1373
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,039
things, um, wait and things pan out.

1374
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,839
But as I say, all I can say is as a HashiCorp representative, we are

1375
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:54,119
committed to keeping Terraform free for, for the vast majority of people

1376
01:17:54,119 --> 01:18:01,119
were committed to creating the best tool that it can be and, um, yeah,

1377
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,360
like we, you know, we genuinely love the community and everything that

1378
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,360
they've done to support that.

1379
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,559
And, um, if anybody feels aggrieved by the things that we've done and I, you

1380
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:13,600
know, I can apologize personally from that, but, but it is, you know, it's,

1381
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,919
it's a thing we want to, we want to keep things to be able to protect.

1382
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,440
And so we can keep it pushed forward.

1383
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:24,839
I don't know what else I can say around those things.

1384
01:18:24,839 --> 01:18:27,279
I think it's, yeah, I couldn't, I can understand that.

1385
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:33,720
Like even company needs to do some trade-offs and, and, and, and like it

1386
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,559
can't be like win for everyone.

1387
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,080
Yeah.

1388
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,160
Um, but in that sense, I completely understand you.

1389
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:48,520
Um, and, um, I, I can also imagine like the, the fuss on the other side, but, but still.

1390
01:18:48,919 --> 01:18:49,279
Yeah.

1391
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:51,199
And I, and I, I understand that as well.

1392
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:56,119
I mean, I'm, I am an open source user as well, but like for me and, and I, and I'll

1393
01:18:56,119 --> 01:19:00,000
be honest with you, like, and I'm talking on a personal level here, not, um, sort

1394
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,639
of ignore the H on my shirt, but when, when we made this sort of change and I sat

1395
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:09,600
down and I'm sort of in my head trying to rationalize, well, what does open source

1396
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,520
actually mean, mean to me?

1397
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:16,760
And, and I thought about this and like, and to be honest, I started looking

1398
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,079
and I'm like, I very rarely actually look at the license.

1399
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:24,799
The key thing for me was the ability to benefit from somebody else's learning.

1400
01:19:24,839 --> 01:19:27,279
The, the ability to, to not have to reinvent the wheel.

1401
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:32,519
I mean, back to my JPEG example, like not having to do that every time.

1402
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:38,880
And as a, as somebody who has an open source project, spend a large amount

1403
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:43,359
of my own personal time working on, I mean, we've been sort of thinking, well,

1404
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:50,760
you know, is, is the NPL license really, is it, is it, is it work for me as an

1405
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:51,359
individual?

1406
01:19:51,839 --> 01:19:56,959
Um, but, but in general, like the, the thing for me that's most important is

1407
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,959
that the, the source code still exists.

1408
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,279
I can still see what's going on.

1409
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:01,440
I can still learn from it.

1410
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:09,559
Um, and I can still consume something, uh, which was always being intended

1411
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:14,359
that we wanted to create something, which was, uh, you know, free, free to

1412
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:17,279
use, which benefits the community as a whole.

1413
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,320
So, yeah, I don't know what, like, what do you think?

1414
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:20,640
I mean, you got opinions.

1415
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,239
What, what?

1416
01:20:25,839 --> 01:20:31,839
I'm, I'm, I'm sort of a looking like looking from the distance because yeah,

1417
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:36,519
like I said, we saw that with like Mongo, we saw that with Elasticsearch.

1418
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:44,040
Um, and I was never in a way affected.

1419
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:51,200
So like me as a, as a, as a consultant or me as a working for, for a company,

1420
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:56,279
but again, it, it really, in the end difference, whether this company is

1421
01:20:56,279 --> 01:21:02,519
actually like selling this, this product or what, what's building like reselling

1422
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:10,839
this, um, forward, um, and yeah, we saw that like, I, I, in a way I understand

1423
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:15,839
both sides, like the way you explain it now, I completely get it.

1424
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:22,040
Um, it, and I also understand the other side saying that like things are not

1425
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:29,119
like defined, um, the way that's like, there could be like exceptions or like,

1426
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,839
and so on and, and, and I, yeah.

1427
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:35,799
And I think that's like, if, if I've got criticism around that, then I

1428
01:21:35,799 --> 01:21:39,160
criticize the lawyers and I think it's, I think it's, you know, I think it's

1429
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,480
fair to, to be, to, to have a kind of a, an inherent hatred of lawyers.

1430
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:47,000
I think that they're generally kind of, if we want, we all want to

1431
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,600
kind of agree on one thing, but no, I mean, the, the legal document is, and

1432
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,880
it is a kind of a legal documents.

1433
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:59,640
It's obviously a contractor license is, is difficult and it's, it, what we've

1434
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:06,119
tried to do is make sure that the, the vast majority can continue as normal

1435
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:12,040
using Terraform as they always have, but have that clause in there, which, which

1436
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:19,320
kind of, um, stops, uh, stops folks from kind of like leveraging all of that

1437
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:24,920
hard work for, and which, which again, affects us to, to kind of invest in

1438
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:29,839
Terraform and with always, when you end up with that sort of thing, it, it, it

1439
01:22:29,839 --> 01:22:31,040
always becomes complex.

1440
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,600
It's not, cause it's difficult to say who is a competitor, who isn't, you

1441
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,359
can't really define that in the license.

1442
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:42,040
But again, to kind of reiterate those things, like, I think if, if you think

1443
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:46,040
that you, you're not sure, if you are not sure that you're competing with

1444
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,559
HashiCorp, I think realistically, you're probably not.

1445
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:53,320
And licensing at HashiCorp will, will be able to clarify that for you.

1446
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,200
And I think they'll sort of, you can give you sort of written, um,

1447
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,959
confirmation that you're, there's no sort of, uh, infringement of licensing.

1448
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:07,359
Um, so I, um, and I hope that as I say, there's time, it's only been what, a

1449
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:13,239
month or so that we'll, we'll get a little bit more sort of, um, used to,

1450
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
to kind of dealing with things.

1451
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,519
But, um, yeah, like honestly, if you, if there's anybody who has any, any sort

1452
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:26,959
of concerns, reach out to me, I'm more than happy to, to, to, to chat, to, to

1453
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,079
kind of, um, put you in touch with people.

1454
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:34,080
If you want to speak to, uh, some, some of the sort of, or get a sort of legal

1455
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,760
answer from, from HashiCorp's team, then we can arrange all of those sorts of things.

1456
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:40,640
Awesome.

1457
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:41,200
Awesome.

1458
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,679
Uh, let's go to more relaxed topics.

1459
01:23:44,799 --> 01:23:47,799
What do you do like to disconnect from all the technology?

1460
01:23:47,799 --> 01:23:49,679
Do you have like any hobbies?

1461
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah.

1462
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,719
So I, I like, well, so firstly I, I do like sport.

1463
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:59,799
So I, um, I swim ultra, um, uh, well, marathon distance and

1464
01:23:59,799 --> 01:24:01,880
ultra marathon distance swimming.

1465
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:06,679
So basically anything, well, marathon distance in swimming is 10 K and above.

1466
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:14,479
Um, so I'll, I do, I do a lot of that, which is, I find very meditative.

1467
01:24:14,559 --> 01:24:19,280
I mean, if you've, um, I don't know if anybody swims or if you've, if you've

1468
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:24,280
ever swum sort of lap swimming, it's, it's very, you know, meditative, especially

1469
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,919
when, uh, if you're swimming front crawl and you've just kind of face in the water.

1470
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:35,719
I find that, um, when you're swimming like between what could be four to six,

1471
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:38,960
seven hours, um, it's very, very relaxing.

1472
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,239
So I, and I enjoy floating around in water as well.

1473
01:24:41,239 --> 01:24:43,039
So there's, um, I do that.

1474
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,000
I do like video games.

1475
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:51,400
Um, I've, I kind of started falling into the slippery slope of sim racing

1476
01:24:51,599 --> 01:24:57,799
recently, um, which I started playing Gran Turismo 7, uh, in VR too.

1477
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,479
And I enjoyed that very much.

1478
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,840
And then all of a sudden the steering wheel appeals in my house.

1479
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,799
And then before you know it, there's a, a, a seat and, uh, yeah,

1480
01:25:06,799 --> 01:25:08,119
that's, that's been a slippery slope.

1481
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:13,520
And recently I've been getting into iRacing, uh, which I'm, I'm quite enjoying.

1482
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,559
But, uh, I also like, you know, other video games.

1483
01:25:16,599 --> 01:25:20,679
Um, I've been playing Starfield, Baldur's Gate 3.

1484
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,400
Um, yeah.

1485
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,960
And, well, and then of course I do a lot of writing, so I'm still working on my,

1486
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,440
my second book, which I'll hopefully get finished soon.

1487
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:36,200
Uh, I'm going to start a new, uh, YouTube channel with, uh, Ivan, who's

1488
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,080
hosting here today at DevOps Days.

1489
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,679
It'll be on a called, uh, doing DevOps where we, we want to kind of get some

1490
01:25:43,559 --> 01:25:46,760
education, uh, put some education back.

1491
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,719
And so the concept is that, that Ivan, uh, has, has learned a lot across his

1492
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:58,440
career and we want to be able to kind of put that back into, to helping people

1493
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,200
who were in the same position as he was when he, when he first began.

1494
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,840
And it's always, I enjoy doing stuff like that as well.

1495
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,520
It's fun.

1496
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:06,679
I enjoy helping people.

1497
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,919
So yeah, pretty much, pretty much.

1498
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:10,799
Walk my dog.

1499
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,320
Um, I'm trying to think.

1500
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:15,679
Eating ice cream.

1501
01:26:18,599 --> 01:26:21,520
There are some nice ice cream shops in the center of Ljubljana.

1502
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:22,640
We can give you a list.

1503
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:25,280
I'm hoping, yeah, later on today we'll maybe check something out.

1504
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,640
Uh, awesome.

1505
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:33,000
But, but since you, since you, since you started like, um, passing on like to, to,

1506
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,479
to, to, to, to, to newbies, uh, into this world.

1507
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:46,000
So for our audience, since there are a lot of like, um, engineers who are now

1508
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,719
at the beginning of their career.

1509
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,599
So I don't know, what would it be your advice where to start if they are interested

1510
01:26:53,599 --> 01:26:59,000
in, in exploring the, the, the DevOps culture and so on, what, what to, what

1511
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,440
would be the, the, the tools to start learning the, the, the, the, the, the

1512
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,840
things that, that, that should they focus on?

1513
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:10,359
Well, I mean, I think you, you absolutely can't go wrong with Terraform and whether

1514
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:14,200
you kind of, um, you know, you, you look at that as the Terraform, OpenTofu,

1515
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,760
whatever, like there is a, as a tool and as a methodology, I think it's something

1516
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,679
as a, that's, that's kind of here to stay, I hope.

1517
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,000
Um, so I think that's definitely something to look at.

1518
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:29,119
I think learning cloud is really hard.

1519
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:33,880
Like I, I have, um, I spend a lot of time working between a number of different

1520
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:38,440
sort of clouds, depending on what I'm trying to sort of show.

1521
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:42,640
So I think having, doing say like your, your GCP AWS or Azure kind of

1522
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,799
certification is always worthwhile because you can get a lot of value out

1523
01:27:46,799 --> 01:27:50,599
of how best to sort of leverage, leverage cloud.

1524
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:55,440
Um, I think folks like DigitalOcean are exceptional as well, like, because

1525
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,359
it's very, it's very accessible and you don't always need this huge amount of

1526
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:04,159
complexity and DO does, um, a very good cloud at a very good price.

1527
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:09,359
Um, so I think, you know, looking at something like that, one thing I will

1528
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,719
say is that I think one of the things that helped me the most when I was

1529
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:18,200
learning was that by teaching that helped me accelerate my own learning.

1530
01:28:18,599 --> 01:28:23,280
And, and I will always say to people that, you know, you, you may not know

1531
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,599
as much as the expert, but I can guarantee you that if you know something,

1532
01:28:26,599 --> 01:28:28,559
you know more than somebody else.

1533
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:35,880
So by passing that back and by, by kind of having this culture of, of sharing

1534
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,479
your knowledge, you're reinforcing that knowledge, but you're also kind of

1535
01:28:39,919 --> 01:28:43,719
helping, helping others who they can then can turn, can, can help you.

1536
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:47,239
And then that, that, that really helps drive things.

1537
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:51,640
So folks like yourself, I'm always incredibly appreciative of, and, um,

1538
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:56,159
thank you so much for, for running the podcast and helping get information out

1539
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:56,440
there.

1540
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,280
Um, YouTube is incredible.

1541
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,880
I mean, I, gosh, I wish it existed when, when I was starting.

1542
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,760
No, the paper books, right?

1543
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:05,239
Oh yeah.

1544
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:10,359
Like, I mean, I, you know, I, yeah, but I have, I have like issues with like

1545
01:29:10,599 --> 01:29:15,359
YouTube, like I was sort of, uh, like getting knowledge from, from books or

1546
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,479
webpages, like you can like scan to the point where, where you need it, the,

1547
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:23,960
the, the information because scanning to the video is, is, is problematic.

1548
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:24,520
Yeah.

1549
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:26,080
I'm, I'm, you know, I'm with you there.

1550
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:31,919
So I think now video seems to be the de facto standard around how

1551
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,880
information is, is produced.

1552
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,640
And so for example, I'm going to, so I'm going to give you a lightning talk later

1553
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:42,440
on today, and one of the things around the lightning talk is a slide every 15

1554
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,520
seconds, there's a capability in Google slides where you can set it to auto

1555
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,719
advance every 15 seconds.

1556
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:53,400
I could not figure out where this was, so I Googled it and there was a video and

1557
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,760
it was a three minute video, which told me to click on three options.

1558
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:03,719
So I think video is maybe not always the most appropriate source.

1559
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,479
As I say, like I'm, um, I've, I've written one book, which published about

1560
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,039
five years ago, I'm working on my second one.

1561
01:30:11,599 --> 01:30:13,320
Um, I do like video.

1562
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,239
I enjoy creating video and I quite enjoy watching video.

1563
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,320
Um, but I, I do worry at the same time that we're not writing enough blog posts

1564
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:27,640
anymore and the advantage of something like a blog post is it's very easy to

1565
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,599
index, so it's, it's very immediate.

1566
01:30:29,599 --> 01:30:34,200
If you want to look for a very specific thing, if that can be indexable through,

1567
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:37,840
through the Google search and just pop up in the search box, you can achieve

1568
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,840
something very, very quickly.

1569
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:43,599
Whereas if you get a video, which has that information somewhere inside it,

1570
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:46,200
it can be a little bit slower.

1571
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:51,400
So, but some people hate reading, like, you know, some people have difficulties

1572
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,200
with, um, with, with, with sort of following, um, printed text.

1573
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:01,200
So having a, the, the medium of video is also very accessible at the same time,

1574
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,039
which I think is, it's also a very good thing.

1575
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,880
It's like, oh, I think maybe we've got pros and cons.

1576
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:07,559
Awesome.

1577
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,679
Uh, I think it's time for us to wrap up.

1578
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:11,219
Yeah.

1579
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,880
Uh, Nick, thank you very much for your time.

01:31:13,919 --> 01:31:16,119
