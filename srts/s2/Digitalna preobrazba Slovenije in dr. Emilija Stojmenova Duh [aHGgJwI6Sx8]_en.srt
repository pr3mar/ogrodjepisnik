1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We've got a message for you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We've got a message for you.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then our glorious jingle comes out,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which we've collected from a hundred archives.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Jingle!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Janic, greetings and welcome to a new episode of Grodje.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's 26 episodes, in numbers.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I have to say that it's already been a year,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and we've been on stage for a year.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We've come a long way since we started

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
filming this on a test set,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because we have a whole team of people behind us

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
who help us keep this thing on a high level.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Today we have a special guest

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
with whom we will try to describe where we travel as a country.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We will try to talk about the challenges on this journey,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
how we will overcome these challenges,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and a lot of things we have in common that interest us.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now we will try to keep the tone very positive,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and try to have an engineering aspect.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Parallaxed.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Parallaxed, yes.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What else can I say?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We will be hosting this time in Maribor,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
at the 3FS company.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We will put a link below, so check out this company.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I would like to thank you for hosting us.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I forgot something at the beginning.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let me introduce you to the guest.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Today is a very special day.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Special.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Will you talk?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, I will.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This fact will bring you closer.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I would also like to thank our special guest,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
researcher Dr. Emili Stojmenov-Duh,

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Minister of Digital Transformation.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She has a doctorate from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
at the University of Maribor.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Before her doctorate, she worked at the company Iskrtel,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and then she started working at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
at the University of Ljubljana.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Last year, she was a professor at the Faculty of Information

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and Communication Technology.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Dr. Stojmenov-Duh is the first graduate professor

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She was also the first president of IEEE

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Women in Engineering Slovenia.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
In January 2024, she was appointed

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Minister of Digital Transformation.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As an author and co-author,

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
she has signed numerous scientific and academic publications

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in the field of digital transformation.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Welcome. Thank you for having us.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you very much.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can I correct something?

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, definitely.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I am not the first graduate professor

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering,

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but at the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think we already copied it.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, of course, we are a bit lazy.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, we didn't copy it from Tech Overflow,

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
but we did a little research,

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and we didn't write it in CHPT,

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
so thank you for that.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Without CHPT, but we have a lot of people

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
who are concerned that we don't present guests well,

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
so we could add that aspect on our own.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We were hoping for quick fixes, but we don't like that.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The professor in me always has to look for a way to fix it.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is that a mistake by the guests?

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, I don't think it's a mistake,

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
but I didn't want to make a mistake by accident.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll leave it to the workers.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We have a lot of topics,

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so let's start with...

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Quite simply.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You lead the Ministry for Digital Transformation.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What is Digital Transformation?

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What is Digital Transformation?

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a bunch of things.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
As I understand it,

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it's the use of new digital technologies

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to create new processes,

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
either through user or consumer experiences,

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
or through the way companies and organizations work.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
On the one hand, it can be used for something new,

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
or to adapt existing processes

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to the way we use existing technologies.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Quite simply.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We use technologies for real processes,

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
not just technologies.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We're not just talking about technologies,

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we're also talking about processes,

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
we're also talking about educating people,

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
mindset,

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
culture,

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
resources,

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and strategies.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When we were preparing for this episode,

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
we had a very interesting experience.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
First, we asked our audience

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
what their difficulties are,

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and what they ask us.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, it's a bit broader.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We asked people what they think.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They gave very interesting feedback,

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
perhaps in the spirit of our time.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They also talked about the lack of understanding

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
of the Ministry.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I went to pick up the digital strategy,

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know, 66 pages,

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
with the attachments,

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
with the documents.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's hear from you.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What is the Ministry?

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What are the basic...

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What is your job?

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It was a soft question,

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
because I saw people...

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
People have a lot of expectations.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Some people don't understand,

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
because the Ministry was created anew,

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the Minister of Forestry was already established,

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
or you already had a place in the Ministry.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But people just don't know

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
what to expect from the Ministry.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But as soon as you started,

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you got a lot of feedback.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This shows that this area is very important

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in our everyday life,

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and also in our everyday work.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Digital transformation,

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
digital technologies

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
came with the new Ministry,

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
with the new service.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But they are part of our life.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In the past, every Ministry

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
dealt with this area on its own.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They dealt with the economy,

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
they dealt with the Ministry of Labor,

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
they dealt with the Ministry of Family Affairs,

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
they balanced certain aspects,

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
education,

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know if you know,

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
but the Broadband Internet for Support

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
was at the Ministry of Agriculture.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And everything we did

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
was given to an organ,

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
a Ministry that will look at all these things

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
closely, and the Ministry

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
is still covering them for its aspects.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Only here, our Ministry

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
has a close strategy,

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that's why we prepared this strategy,

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to show what the goal is,

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
what the vision of Slovenia is in this area.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And even when we finance

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
certain projects,

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
we will not prepare to finance

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the same areas on agriculture,

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
on infrastructure,

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
on trade,

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
but somehow these things are connected.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Interoperability is also

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
very modern,

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
but what is it about?

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's about having the data

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
in one place, not having to bring it 20 times,

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
every different resource,

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
every different organization,

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
but to have it inside,

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and to manage it, because it already exists.

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's why the Ministry

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
was created.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ok.

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I will try again,

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
again, I want to be

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
positive, but...

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I prepared,

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
when we were preparing,

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I prepared your social channels,

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Instagram, Facebook,

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and so on,

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and tomorrow I see

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
a picture of you,

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
with the image of older people,

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I think in Velenje,

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and I thought, ok, great,

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
then in a couple of hours we will prepare

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
a certificate, and then it's

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a shitstorm,

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and then you see

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
all this

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
thunder,

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
is this your dignity?

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Is it, I repeat,

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
is it still the dignity of the Ministry?

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Will you

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
direct them through these things?

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Is this a digital transformation?

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I mean, this is about hygiene,

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
just hygiene, that you have

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
proper maintenance of certificates.

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Before you were talking

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
about digital transformation, I added

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
a mindset, that it is necessary

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to change the mindset, and just as

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
we have to make sure that our personal

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
certificate does not go wrong,

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
or that we properly provide

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
a driver's license, we also have to

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
properly provide a certificate.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is our role here?

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Our role is to inform

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
all these organizations,

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
to teach them,

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that this is a part of basic hygiene.

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It is not our fault that

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the IPES certificate went wrong,

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
because

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
when we realized that this

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
problem had arisen, we could not

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
start calling IPES, our partners,

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
to do this job.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We saw that IPES was not the only one,

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
but at least some other organization.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What did we do on the basis of this?

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We prepared a letter,

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and we sent it to everyone,

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and we will not conclude here.

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We have a lot to do at our Ministry,

235
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because we warn other organizations.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For example, another such

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
problem is the electronic signature.

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Again, we sent a letter,

239
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
we organize meetings,

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
because the rest of our resource

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
is not only the Ministry, but also

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
agencies and everything that falls

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
from the internal sector.

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We want to tell them that

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the electronic signature

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
according to Slovenian and European

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
legislation is equally valuable

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
to the personal signature.

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Our role as a Ministry is

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to inform, to teach others,

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and we all have to

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
enter the mindset of digital transformation.

253
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And this is our role,

254
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
which we have and see.

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Now we both come from

256
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the industry,

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and we are assigned to

258
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
VPM of Engineering,

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
CTO,

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
CEO,

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and I am most curious about

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
how the Ministry is composed.

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Is it for various departments,

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
directors, how does it all work?

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can tell you how we are organized,

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
if you are interested.

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We have four directorates

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
within the Ministry.

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is the Directorate for Digital Society.

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is where the information society

271
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is more involved, where competencies fall,

272
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
then new modern technologies,

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Artificial Intelligence, block editing,

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and so on.

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Then we have the Directorate for Digital

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and Financial Economy.

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is where you get to know

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the E-governance,

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
then there is the electronic

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
personal certificate, certificates,

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and the general portal

282
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
is on this directorate.

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Then we have the Directorate for Infrastructure.

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Here are the supervisors,

285
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
because we have the entire public administration,

286
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the public sector, H-Com network

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
is in our Ministry,

288
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and the Directorate for Supporting Users,

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
which is the ECC center,

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
we get a lot of compliments from users

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that they are very satisfied.

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
In addition, we also have

293
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the Service for International

294
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and European Affairs,

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
we have our own Secretariat,

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
the Legal Service, and all the staff

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that you know in the companies.

298
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So that's how we are somehow organized.

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The directorates have directors,

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
then there are sectors within

301
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the individual directorate,

302
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and that's it.

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Too simple.

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's how you

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
logically know everything.

306
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I just saw

307
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
that you also have

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
an organ in the Directorate of Inspection.

309
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Exactly.

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I wrote to you,

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
many of us

312
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
in the community

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
some time ago

314
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
received

315
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
an e-mail that

316
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
we need to go to...

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
To look for accessibility.

318
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Accessibility.

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And then we realized

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that there is also an organ in the station.

321
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I also saw that.

322
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I just wanted to add that.

323
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it is very important

324
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that we are proud of the organ.

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I didn't want to forget it,

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
but because the inspectorate must be independent.

327
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And they also warn us

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
when we make mistakes.

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If someone does it in the directorate,

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
we also get a finger.

331
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But if, for example,

332
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
we don't give an additional explanation,

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the inspector calls us like that.

334
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Why did this happen?

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
On the one hand,

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
there was a shared opinion in the public.

337
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Some said, what do you need from us?

338
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you owe us with this?

339
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We only have an additional part.

340
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
On the other hand, we got a full compliment.

341
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Someone finally went crazy.

342
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Because the law exists.

343
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But if the law exists and we don't enforce it,

344
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
we haven't done anything with it.

345
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I am sure that we have

346
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
to thank the main inspector.

347
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because our intention was not

348
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
to go to prison.

349
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Our intention was to warn,

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to see what is going on.

351
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
To talk to everyone,

352
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
to explain.

353
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And people also understand it.

354
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Again, it's about informing.

355
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
To know that we have to

356
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
pay attention to public access.

357
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because we always say that we want to be in the spotlight.

358
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
In the last episode,

359
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
it was with the

360
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
private expert from Australia.

361
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
A hacker who helps people

362
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
become more

363
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
safe in the organization.

364
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
To protect them in some way.

365
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We asked him

366
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
a question like

367
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
how do you get

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
in the organization this knowledge

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that something is important

370
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and that companies strategically decide

371
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
to change certain things.

372
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I said

373
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
very simply.

374
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If there are no

375
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
legal requirements

376
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that companies

377
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
have to meet,

378
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
certain strategies

379
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
are not paid

380
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
to invest in it.

381
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We both know

382
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that security

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
is in the last place.

384
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Accessibility does not come

385
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
when we develop

386
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
some commercial solutions.

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Unless those solutions are intended

388
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
for some groups

389
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
where it is very important.

390
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It is understandable that

391
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
we take care and the contrast

392
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
of the text on the back

393
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
or all other things is not important.

394
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But all these standards have existed

395
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
for a long time.

396
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I am not among the youngest,

397
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but I graduated

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
from this field.

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We have been talking about it for many years.

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We just don't always

401
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
think about creating new

402
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
websites or new mobile applications.

403
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
We are people

404
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
who see worse

405
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and we need to be careful.

406
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
When we publish on social networks

407
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
for someone

408
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
they don't see the personality

409
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that we want

410
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to share

411
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
or to come to them.

412
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
From this point of view,

413
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
exactly through the inspectorate,

414
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
through the laws,

415
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we can get them to use

416
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
in practice.

417
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Now we are being listened to

418
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
by engineers and engineers of the future.

419
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Future engineers and engineers

420
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and all the people

421
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
who are interested in these things.

422
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I believe that

423
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
it is good to have an overflow

424
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
of knowledge and information

425
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
on a higher level,

426
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
so that you can look for this connection.

427
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I am interested in what you expect

428
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
from engineers and engineers

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
to our audience.

430
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What I would like

431
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
is

432
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
even if it is a constructive

433
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
criticism,

434
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
even if it is a warning

435
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
that we have overlooked something

436
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
or that we are working on something.

437
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What is happening today,

438
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't want to generalize,

439
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we get a lot of

440
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
foreign engineers and engineers

441
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
of non-governmental organizations

442
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
who have proposals

443
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
to do something.

444
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
One thing is impossible

445
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
due to various reasons.

446
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
One thing is impossible

447
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
right now,

448
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
but we will start thinking about it.

449
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The worst thing is

450
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that we don't know

451
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
why we need the Ministry of Digital Transformation.

452
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It was useful for us.

453
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
On the other hand,

454
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I have to praise

455
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the investigators in this example.

456
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
When something happened,

457
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
they sent us a message

458
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
to check what can be done

459
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
in this area.

460
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It helped us.

461
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We checked what we could do.

462
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Not only investigators,

463
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but also government organizations

464
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and other organizations.

465
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They were very welcome

466
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
with their proposals.

467
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We absolutely accept criticism,

468
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
but we have to be constructive.

469
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Now,

470
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
before we started

471
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
preparing for this episode,

472
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
the Minister of Digital Transformation

473
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
explained to us

474
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
that we have

475
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
some public services,

476
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
which will be digitized.

477
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
On the other hand,

478
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
we started thinking

479
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and the investigators also asked

480
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
what engineers can expect

481
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
from this ministry.

482
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
One of the things

483
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
is the digitization

484
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
of the economy.

485
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What are the things

486
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that can be expected

487
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
from our employees

488
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
or from the Ministry?

489
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Engineers are probably

490
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
also entrepreneurs.

491
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What we are doing

492
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
is that we want

493
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
all the public services

494
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
to be digitally free.

495
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You don't have to

496
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
go to different offices,

497
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
but you can do

498
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
whatever you want.

499
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
A lot of this is already free.

500
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
According to the strategy

501
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
of digital public services,

502
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
we want all the key services

503
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
connected to the enterprise

504
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to be digitally free,

505
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and our teams are working

506
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
in this area.

507
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
All the engineers

508
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
who develop digital solutions

509
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
probably want their employees

510
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
to know how to use them.

511
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Our wish

512
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
is not only to use

513
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
digital services

514
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
in the public sector,

515
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
but also in the private sector.

516
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is not just a wish,

517
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
but a reality.

518
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
A lot of these services

519
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
are already being used

520
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
in the private sector,

521
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
for authentication,

522
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
for security authentication.

523
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You don't have to develop

524
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
your own solutions,

525
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
but the state already offers them.

526
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So maybe not everything

527
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
is direct,

528
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
but it can also be indirect.

529
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
For example, in five years,

530
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
if I want to go to the gym,

531
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I won't need a gym and gymnasium,

532
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I will have my own digital gymnasium.

533
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I hope it will be like in five years.

534
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I wanted to ask you

535
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
when you said

536
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
that you want more connectivity

537
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
with the employees,

538
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
even though I took the strategy

539
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
a bit to the right and a bit to the left,

540
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
a lot of these systems

541
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
are siloed information.

542
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If you want one thing,

543
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
you have one evidence,

544
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
then you have a book,

545
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
then you have a system.

546
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
These things are distributed.

547
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I am interested in what you do

548
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
in the real estate in this area.

549
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
How will you prepare

550
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Interpobility in this context?

551
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You said it today,

552
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
you posted a picture on Twitter

553
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
to choose our digital strategy,

554
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
which is great.

555
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Otherwise, the digital strategy has 40 pages.

556
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There are 66 pages because of the attachment.

557
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I wanted a very short

558
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and very specific document.

559
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And there you probably also prepared

560
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
that we will have

561
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
ministers as a strategic witness,

562
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
in addition to representatives

563
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
of businesses,

564
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
non-governmental organizations,

565
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
talk organizations and so on.

566
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And that means

567
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
that they will support

568
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
projects for digital transformation.

569
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And if they sit at the same table,

570
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
then they know what is happening.

571
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Here we are talking strategically.

572
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
On the other hand, we also have

573
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
an operational group, these are directors

574
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
of various ministries,

575
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and when they develop solutions,

576
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
they talk to each other.

577
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
For example, last week,

578
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
we met with colleagues from the Ministry

579
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
for Internal Affairs and the Ministry

580
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
for Infrastructure on the topic

581
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
of mobile train stations.

582
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And in this way,

583
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
they come to this transition,

584
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
because for the longest time,

585
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
they did not know who

586
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
what will start, what is developing.

587
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And here, for example, we have a great experience

588
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
with the Ministry of Health,

589
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
now you probably noticed

590
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
that it is renewed,

591
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and here with our colleagues

592
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
who are participating,

593
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in this way, then

594
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
we have a lot of energy,

595
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
which we have again demonstrated

596
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
how important it is in our strategy

597
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Digital Slovenia.

598
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is my favorite topic, notes.

599
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Because you are the only one

600
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
without a note, maybe you too.

601
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But let's go to the next question,

602
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
somehow related to the strategy

603
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Digital Slovenia 2030.

604
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Now I can ask

605
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
some questions,

606
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
you can introduce them to us,

607
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
you probably already know,

608
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
As I said,

609
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
it was extremely important for us

610
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
that this strategy is short

611
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and clear document,

612
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and that we do not go to some blablabla

613
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
talk, but to know exactly

614
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
what are the priorities,

615
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
what goals do we have,

616
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and from this strategy then follows

617
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the action plan, which is already being prepared,

618
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and in the action plan we will precisely say

619
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
financial resources,

620
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and who is responsible for what.

621
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So here we only have a strategy,

622
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and from this to determine responsibilities,

623
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
then we did not anticipate

624
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
how far we would go.

625
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Some compliments,

626
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I as a member of non-governmental

627
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
organizations, of course, choose a lot of strategies,

628
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and one compliment

629
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that is,

630
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
in this strategy,

631
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I like the main

632
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
summaries,

633
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the current situation,

634
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
then some milestone

635
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
2025,

636
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
then 2030,

637
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and as we say at home,

638
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
we are from the company Tenso,

639
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
some KPI, which can be easily

640
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
validated and see

641
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
how we progress in this strategy.

642
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I would always like,

643
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
we have already discussed this,

644
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
but I would always like to know

645
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
for our audience,

646
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
what are the main areas

647
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that are now the most important

648
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
until 2030?

649
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
KPI, because I am also an engineer,

650
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and therefore it is also

651
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
very important for me to measure

652
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
whether we have achieved something successful or not.

653
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So the key to digital transformation

654
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
starts with infrastructure.

655
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Gigabit infrastructure,

656
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
both fixed and mobile networks.

657
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We want up to 20-30

658
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
gigabit infrastructure for all

659
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
businesses in the country, regardless of geographical location.

660
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Mobile internet

661
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
equally, 5G,

662
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
so that we have everything covered,

663
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
all the places, all the support,

664
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
all the roads.

665
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Why roads? Because of autonomous driving.

666
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Then the next category

667
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
is digital inclusion,

668
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and here with digital inclusion

669
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
we are not only talking about digital competencies,

670
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but we are also talking about

671
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
that everyone can

672
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
transport that gigabit

673
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
infrastructure, even

674
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
economically.

675
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Then they also need equipment

676
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
to be able to use those tables.

677
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and not last but not least, digital knowledge and competences,

678
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
to enable all 80% of residents to have all basic competences,

679
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
to be able to use various devices that we have at our disposal,

680
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
both from the public sector and from the private sector.

681
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The next category is digital transformation of the economy.

682
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The strategy of digital transformation of the economy

683
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
was made at the Ministry of Economy before,

684
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and given that it is a crown strategy,

685
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
here we include the main KPIs,

686
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
it is important for us that, for example,

687
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
most companies use cloud storage,

688
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
that they use one of these new technologies,

689
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and we are aware that we cannot do everything,

690
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
but that at least some of these new technologies.

691
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The next thing we have is a smart society,

692
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
5.0, tax economy,

693
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
which means a lot to us here,

694
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
which means open data,

695
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
re-use of data,

696
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
also foreign companies for various innovations,

697
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and of course we cannot do without information security.

698
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Information security is part of the strategy

699
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
that was prepared at the URSS,

700
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
that is the Council of the Republic of Slovenia for Information Security,

701
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
but here, in the crown strategy,

702
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
we take these key gifts.

703
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't know where this fits in,

704
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but you talked about the tax...

705
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't know, growth of the tax...

706
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And the economy.

707
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And the economy.

708
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The OPSI portal,

709
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I think it also fits under your wings.

710
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
From this we saw a bunch of interesting projects,

711
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and opportunities,

712
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and it is a very nice project.

713
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I wonder how you will continue with open data,

714
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
is it a European direction,

715
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
does Europe want us to have data at will,

716
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
or is it a Slovenian unit?

717
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
No, we don't have to take credit for it.

718
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I will go back a bit,

719
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and I will ask you this way.

720
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Probably some European strategy

721
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
will have an impact on how you designed the strategy

722
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Digital Slovenia 2030,

723
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and probably Europe will also give some funds

724
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
through this strategy in this project, right?

725
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It is about the European Digital Decade program.

726
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And there are sources,

727
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
which are knowledge and competence,

728
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
economy, infrastructure,

729
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
digital public services,

730
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I forgot to mention one of the categories,

731
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and in our strategy we also looked at

732
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the characteristics we have in our country,

733
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
we added horizontal principles,

734
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
which are extremely important for us,

735
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
open, inclusive, free internet,

736
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
democratic society,

737
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
open code solutions,

738
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and so on,

739
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and also, which is extremely important,

740
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
digital and green transformation.

741
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So we draw from European documents and strategies,

742
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and we apply them to the environment we have at home.

743
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Why do we draw from European documents?

744
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because we want to go to the interstate.

745
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Our digital declaration was already used

746
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
abroad in Europe,

747
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it is accessible,

748
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and even this year,

749
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
you will be able to use it in one of your neighboring countries,

750
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't know, you will go to the sea in Croatia,

751
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and you will, for example,

752
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
get an e-mail at the hospital

753
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
in the Croatian Museum of Health.

754
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So we don't have to be alone here,

755
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
but we also have to look at

756
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
what is happening in Europe.

757
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Now, as far as funds are concerned,

758
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
of course, just this week,

759
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the European Commission also announced a new program,

760
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the Digital Europe program,

761
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
which is a huge amount of money,

762
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and one of the problems we are facing in Slovenia

763
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
is that Slovenian companies

764
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
use their opportunities too little,

765
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
they don't apply for contracts.

766
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Today, in Maribor, we have, for example,

767
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I don't know if I can say this,

768
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Tico Pro, which supports companies

769
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
when applying for contracts,

770
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
but they are not the only ones,

771
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
there are others too,

772
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and the company simply does not make the effort

773
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to apply for a contract and receive funds,

774
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
sometimes they bring the funds we have at home,

775
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
sometimes we have them ready,

776
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
sometimes we have them in the form of a cohesion,

777
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
sometimes we also have them in the form of an account,

778
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
sometimes in the form of a draft

779
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
for protection and resistance,

780
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
but there is also a huge amount of money at will.

781
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I mean, the companies probably don't apply

782
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
because it's an additional job

783
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
to prepare all the documentation needed,

784
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and it's also a risk.

785
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Are you going to sign them?

786
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
There are others who will pay hundreds

787
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
to prepare it for you, right?

788
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Or are you investing in people

789
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
who will learn it?

790
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
From my own experience,

791
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
because I started it before at the faculty,

792
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
it really is an investment in people,

793
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
but this investment will return to you very quickly.

794
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That means, yes,

795
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
a larger Slovenian company,

796
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
which has these lines,

797
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
but they also have to think about

798
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
having project leaders for European companies.

799
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The question is, does it have to be a large company?

800
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'll tell you from experience.

801
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's a very demanding job.

802
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's a very demanding job.

803
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's a very demanding job.

804
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's a very demanding job,

805
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
let's put it that way.

806
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But as the minister said,

807
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
from my experience,

808
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
if I, as a company,

809
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
applied for the same job,

810
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I would probably hire a specialist

811
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
because there is a gap

812
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
between communication.

813
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You're not a specialist.

814
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You're not a specialist.

815
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But I believe that

816
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
if you had more human resources

817
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
or someone in the company

818
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
who would be extremely interested in it,

819
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
which is difficult in our IT companies,

820
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
it would definitely pay off.

821
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
it would definitely pay off.

822
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's not a bauble,

823
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but it's a kind of experience.

824
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I would also ask that.

825
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
A lot of people were asking

826
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
about the digital strategy.

827
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
about the digital strategy.

828
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
These are strategies

829
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
that will take more years

830
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to become a reality.

831
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The previous strategy was Slovenia 2.20.

832
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The previous strategy was Slovenia 2.20.

833
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I believe that in that strategy

834
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
33-50% of the work was done.

835
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
33-50% of the work was done.

836
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A lot of our listeners

837
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
are interested

838
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
in whether we will survive

839
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
the politics

840
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
that is inside.

841
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Are we really tied to it?

842
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Are we really tied to it?

843
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't see much difference

844
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't see much difference

845
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
from what we have seen here.

846
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't see much difference

847
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
from what we have seen here.

848
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I hope that we will survive

849
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and that we will go

850
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
with some corrections.

851
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
We also have similar challenges.

852
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Wherever we go to work,

853
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
there is a strategy

854
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and we hope that it doesn't change

855
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and we hope that it doesn't change

856
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
when things get better.

857
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
These strategies are not just

858
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
because we wanted to write

859
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
a strategy.

860
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Almost all European funds

861
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
are dependent on how

862
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
the state prepares the documents.

863
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
This has nothing to do

864
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
with the current local politics.

865
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This has nothing to do

866
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
with the current local politics.

867
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
To prevent what happened

868
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
to Digital Slovenia 2.20

869
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
to prevent what happened

870
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to Digital Slovenia 2.20

871
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and to prevent the strategic

872
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and operational group

873
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that will work on it

874
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and will prepare

875
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
whether the guidelines are fulfilled

876
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
or not.

877
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I don't worry about that.

878
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't worry about that.

879
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's very different.

880
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's very different.

881
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Don't be afraid.

882
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Don't be afraid.

883
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
If you can,

884
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
take the document.

885
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's great.

886
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It has nice graphics

887
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It has nice graphics

888
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and everything is highlighted.

889
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and everything is highlighted.

890
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
We will now talk

891
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
about the main areas

892
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
through a conversation.

893
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,000

894
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
through a conversation.

895
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I would like to go first.

896
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I would like to go first.

897
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
We will return to

898
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
digital strategy

899
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
through a conversation.

900
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I would like to go first.

901
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
People are asking

902
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
people are asking

903
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
whether the user experience

904
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
in public services

905
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
in public services

906
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
is not good enough.

907
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
People are asking

908
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
whether there are

909
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
some specific problems

910
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that some friends

911
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that you don't like.

912
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
How can we constructively

913
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
fix this?

914
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
We thought

915
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
that we should look at

916
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
a state-approved

917
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
law and a process.

918
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
For example,

919
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
we should prepare

920
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
a beer, pay a beer market

921
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and then what happens

922
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
we have a paper form

923
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
that we digitalize

924
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
so we make the same

925
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
document in a nice

926
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
HTML form

927
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and then we fill in

928
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
everything and click submit.

929
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And now

930
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the question is

931
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
do we understand that all citizens

932
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
can't

933
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and want to be

934
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
able to solve

935
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
the problem

936
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
digitally with certificates.

937
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's why we have to think

938
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
that there are also old school ways

939
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
but I'm interested

940
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
if you think that a law

941
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
should be more digital first

942
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
like in web development

943
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
we call it mobile first.

944
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We developed a website

945
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
for mobile computers

946
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and now we mainly design for mobile

947
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and then we look back at

948
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
how it is on desktop.

949
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you think that some steps

950
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
or suggestions

951
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
should be made

952
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
more digital

953
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
to make the law more

954
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
digital first

955
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
so that people

956
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
don't have to worry about

957
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the fallback?

958
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We are working on that.

959
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Maybe we started with

960
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
digital first

961
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
which means

962
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
electronic signature

963
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
which doesn't mean

964
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that they scan documents

965
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and then send them to us.

966
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Here we are talking about

967
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
digitization,

968
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
digitalization

969
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and digital transformation.

970
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
When it comes to

971
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
changing the whole culture

972
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
or organization.

973
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Here at the Ministry

974
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
we are working on

975
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
digital first

976
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
because we still have

977
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
50% of the population

978
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
that doesn't have basic digital skills

979
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and we can't automatically exclude them.

980
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But we are trying

981
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
to increase

982
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
their advantages

983
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
or whatever.

984
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
All the laws

985
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
that are adopted by the government

986
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
of the Republic of Slovenia

987
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
are usually based on

988
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
inter-resource collaboration

989
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and our Ministry

990
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
always offers suggestions

991
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
on what should be done

992
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
in the field of digital transformation.

993
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
When are these suggestions

994
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
accepted?

995
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Trust me, we always give them.

996
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Just as you are excited

997
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
about the new technologies

998
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
we have the same

999
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
at the Ministry of Employment.

1000
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They are preparing trends

1001
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and we also want

1002
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
what you want in the economy

1003
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
we also want that in the Public Administration.

1004
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Now that we are

1005
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
at the Ministry of Employment

1006
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
we can have a glass of water

1007
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
before we go to the Ministry of Employment.

1008
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We are in Maribor

1009
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and we will have a glass of water.

1010
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
We will drink it later.

1011
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Aren't you a student here?

1012
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
No, I was a student.

1013
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Phew, if you say so.

1014
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Now, we are a bit past

1015
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
the Ministry of Employment

1016
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
announcement

1017
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
about digital transformation.

1018
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
PR was concluded

1019
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
but it is definitely

1020
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
worth accepting.

1021
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I love accepting

1022
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
when I pick up something

1023
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
on the market.

1024
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Plus what technologies

1025
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
are being used.

1026
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I recommend it to all listeners.

1027
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
In the coming years

1028
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
there are

1029
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
ambitious projects ahead of you.

1030
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What kind of people are you looking for

1031
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and how will you attract them?

1032
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We already have 29 quotas

1033
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
in the field of

1034
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
digital transformation.

1035
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
In addition,

1036
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
at the Directorate for

1037
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
IT

1038
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and also at the Directorate for

1039
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Digital Solutions and Tax

1040
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Economy, which is the most

1041
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
hardcore of IT,

1042
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
a lot of employees

1043
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
will retire in the coming years.

1044
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Here we see

1045
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
a big problem of how we will

1046
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
get staff, especially because

1047
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
in the public sector we have a paid system

1048
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and at the moment

1049
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
in the private sector

1050
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
the situation is as it is.

1051
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But this is not

1052
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
a challenge only for

1053
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
our ministry, this is a challenge

1054
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
for the entire government,

1055
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
the state if we can say so,

1056
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and we also talk about it at the government.

1057
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We are looking for

1058
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
various solutions.

1059
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Now, how we will get

1060
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
these staff, we will

1061
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
try to impress young people.

1062
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Also for interesting

1063
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
projects, because

1064
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
it is not always the artists

1065
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
who encourage you to work.

1066
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
If it were so, I would never

1067
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
work in the public sector.

1068
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Then

1069
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
we will also

1070
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
be able to get as a society

1071
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
to be able to import

1072
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
some staff,

1073
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
because

1074
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
as a state we have them, but

1075
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
what do we eat if we have them?

1076
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yes, now

1077
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
as a person who was

1078
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
not a governor

1079
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
for a few years,

1080
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
these projects

1081
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
have always been

1082
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
we are a state,

1083
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
we all pay

1084
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
with these taxes a little

1085
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and so that we can

1086
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
use this money

1087
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and spend it

1088
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
in a

1089
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
logical way to

1090
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
work on projects.

1091
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
When we build something new,

1092
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
it is a project.

1093
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But

1094
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
often in some

1095
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
information systems,

1096
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
yes, we can

1097
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
build it, but information systems

1098
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
are a living system.

1099
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It requires maintenance,

1100
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
for which we can get a job.

1101
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
There are also security challenges,

1102
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
because technology is changing

1103
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and every year

1104
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the security aspect is

1105
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
more challenging.

1106
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And now

1107
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the question is

1108
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
how to ensure

1109
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
that these systems will be safe

1110
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
in the future?

1111
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
How do we get

1112
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
a staff for a project,

1113
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
which is maybe 5 years old,

1114
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
to be able to maintain it?

1115
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
In companies we often ask

1116
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
how we will maintain the staff.

1117
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Is it more complicated

1118
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
because there are projects?

1119
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
There are not only projects,

1120
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
because if there were projects,

1121
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
we would not be able to maintain

1122
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
the network and take care

1123
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
of all the security aspects

1124
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
within the public sector.

1125
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So with us, especially

1126
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
at the Directorate for Informatics,

1127
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
there is a lot of maintenance,

1128
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
security, every application.

1129
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
When it comes to the network,

1130
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
it must be tested

1131
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
to avoid problems,

1132
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
as we mentioned in the past.

1133
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
On the one hand,

1134
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
we have regular employees,

1135
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
on the other hand,

1136
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
because we do not have to attract them,

1137
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
we have a number of employers

1138
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
with whom we cooperate.

1139
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
In our case,

1140
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
it is not so much about project work,

1141
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
but in the area of infrastructure,

1142
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
if we are talking about monitoring

1143
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and data centers,

1144
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
these are not projects,

1145
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
we are more concerned

1146
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
with the employees.

1147
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
When we were investigating,

1148
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
you had 20-30 votes

1149
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
for the secretary.

1150
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Undersecretary.

1151
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Undersecretary, yes.

1152
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I think there was

1153
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
a certain number of votes,

1154
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
up to 26-27.

1155
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That is because you were

1156
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
looking at the period

1157
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
when the drawings for

1158
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
protection and resistance were opened,

1159
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and it is the financing period

1160
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
of these projects.

1161
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But I mentioned earlier

1162
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that a lot of employees

1163
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
are also retired now.

1164
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Logically, you can not be employed

1165
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
more often if you are retired.

1166
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
No, they should be replaced.

1167
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But you probably looked

1168
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
at the time we gave

1169
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
for the new project.

1170
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because we saw

1171
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
the date

1172
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
26, and we wondered

1173
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
why would anyone

1174
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
want to commit,

1175
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
if they know that

1176
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
they are paying lower prices

1177
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
in the industry,

1178
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and the projects will lose

1179
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
these people in the industry

1180
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
because of these skills.

1181
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But of course we did not know

1182
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
what to do now.

1183
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It would be interesting

1184
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
if we could go

1185
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
to those attacks

1186
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and hacking,

1187
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
what is happening now.

1188
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It is probably a consequence

1189
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
of these systems

1190
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
that are attacked

1191
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
for protection and solution.

1192
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
These systems are probably

1193
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
already old.

1194
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I will make an assumption.

1195
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
We probably also have

1196
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the problem that, as we said before,

1197
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
people are retired.

1198
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We will probably also be able to

1199
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
retire some systems and make new ones.

1200
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It is true for very different systems.

1201
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Different bodies

1202
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
are responsible for different things.

1203
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
For example,

1204
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
URSIL has a special department

1205
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
for information security.

1206
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
At the Ministry of Digital Transformation

1207
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
we have a department for security testing

1208
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
of applications that we install

1209
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
inside the Hacom network.

1210
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
We have great equipment

1211
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
and great technology

1212
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and we did not have

1213
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
any critical attacks

1214
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
in this case.

1215
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Many times it is also

1216
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
a human factor.

1217
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
At the Ministry of Security and Solution

1218
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
the technology was not problematic

1219
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
but the human factor was problematic.

1220
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It is not that obvious.

1221
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yes, yes.

1222
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It is probably the same

1223
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
challenges as we discussed before.

1224
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You also have

1225
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
people who will be detained.

1226
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Logically, you have to upgrade

1227
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
their knowledge.

1228
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
They also have to remain digitally written

1229
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
and they need time.

1230
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I certainly understand that.

1231
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
As part of

1232
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
this software

1233
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
we received another question.

1234
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
This question was

1235
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
asked by Today.

1236
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Do you think

1237
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
that the software

1238
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
should be financed

1239
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
with public money also open-source?

1240
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Open-source means

1241
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
that the user gets

1242
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
the source code

1243
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and the public

1244
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
is also interested.

1245
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Can you give another example?

1246
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yes, for example

1247
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
a typical school example

1248
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
is a software

1249
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that has

1250
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
a value of

1251
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
21%

1252
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and we decide to

1253
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
increase or decrease

1254
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
it to 20%.

1255
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
If we are not the owners

1256
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
of the software

1257
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
code,

1258
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
the former user

1259
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
has a better

1260
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
access position because

1261
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
no one can judge

1262
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
how complicated it is.

1263
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Of course, if we have

1264
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
a super-trivial source code,

1265
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
it is always easier

1266
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
to upgrade

1267
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
or change the source code.

1268
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
If you are the owner,

1269
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
you can choose

1270
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
the source code

1271
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
and you don't become

1272
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
an old public orderer.

1273
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
There are also

1274
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
good examples of practice.

1275
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
For example, in a healthy state

1276
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
the application is open-source.

1277
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
This is what we had

1278
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
for the tracking.

1279
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
This is a good example of practice.

1280
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We decided to

1281
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
put the code on GitHub

1282
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
because it is open-source.

1283
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I am interested in your opinion.

1284
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I think that

1285
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
we should order

1286
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
a software in public money

1287
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
so that the state can own it.

1288
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Not only do I think about it,

1289
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
but I also support it.

1290
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I am also a state secretary.

1291
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
If you were aware,

1292
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
we presented a computer

1293
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
composition

1294
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
with a novel law

1295
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
called MIRO

1296
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
which is a mechanism

1297
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
for processing computer equipment.

1298
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
The software

1299
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
will be open-source.

1300
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
This is

1301
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
an example.

1302
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Now the order will also go

1303
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
to public money.

1304
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
We also talked a lot about

1305
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
networking of government organizations

1306
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
and we are looking for ways

1307
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
to make it all open-source.

1308
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I absolutely support it.

1309
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Great.

1310
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Let's conclude.

1311
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Open-source is this.

1312
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It is easier to say more

1313
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
about the state of health.

1314
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I will tell you what the example was.

1315
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Now

1316
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I will tell you

1317
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
what the example was.

1318
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The German government sent

1319
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
SAP and Deutsche Telekom

1320
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
to develop the CoronaWarn app for Germany

1321
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
as an open-source software.

1322
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Deutsche Telekom has prepared

1323
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
a mobile technology,

1324
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
stable management

1325
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and application management.

1326
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
SAP was responsible

1327
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
for the development of the app

1328
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and its core platform.

1329
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
What all the

1330
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
employees did

1331
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
was open-source

1332
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and published.

1333
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Slovenia took the code

1334
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and made some modifications

1335
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
relevant to our space.

1336
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
This is an example.

1337
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
This is what we were aiming for.

1338
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
There are

1339
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
different variations

1340
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
of the term

1341
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
open-source.

1342
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I will go into this.

1343
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
What do we have here?

1344
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yes.

1345
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Why are you posing like this?

1346
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
This is my

1347
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
home area.

1348
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Open-source means

1349
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
that you get the code as a manual.

1350
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
There is also a term

1351
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
open-source, which means

1352
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
that it is publicly available

1353
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
to a wider audience.

1354
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Lately, this term is fading away.

1355
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
We think that it is

1356
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
publicly available.

1357
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
These are the details.

1358
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
For me personally,

1359
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
the most important thing is

1360
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that only the ministry

1361
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
which gave the order

1362
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
has the code.

1363
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I am happy that

1364
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
we will be able to build a bridge

1365
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
where the state can

1366
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
draw a bridge.

1367
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Absolutely.

1368
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I can not imagine

1369
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
how it will work.

1370
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You will be

1371
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
bitten by a large snake.

1372
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We are all engineers here, but it is clear to us that in Europe and in Slovenia we are good engineers, I believe in it, I think we have a lot of talent, we have a good company, but we don't have that many unicorn companies.

1373
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't think it is necessary now, but it is nice that there are some players with more capitalization in our region, in Europe and maybe also in Slovenia.

1374
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Unicorns are a billion-dollar company. What do you think is the main reason why we don't have more unicorns in Europe?

1375
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Again, there are many reasons. One is the fragmentation of the market. If we look at the United States, it is a much bigger market than if we look at China.

1376
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
On the other hand, in Europe we have very small markets.

1377
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The second reason is, as I also had the opportunity to find out how investors function, American investors, if they see a potential opportunity for someone to succeed, invest in this company.

1378
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
In our country, investment is short-lived, when someone has something to show. And here is the problem.

1379
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Another problem is the way we think. In the United States, it doesn't matter if you make a mistake a hundred times, you learned something new from it.

1380
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:59,000
In our country, if you make a mistake, and I'm not just talking about Slovenia, everything is similar in Austria and Germany, if you make a mistake, then it's the end of the story and you don't dare to try again.

1381
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And this is already observed in classrooms. I see it in students. We don't go to those iterations. It doesn't matter if you don't succeed for the first time, let's try again.

1382
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm not that expert on unicorns. I also explain.

1383
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You have to hope. We are also recording this podcast. We are doing a lot of things in Czech. I hope we will try.

1384
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
We also recorded an hour of the podcast without hitting the microphone. That's how it happens.

1385
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But now everyone will hit it. We learned something.

1386
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Actually, this question about unicorns was a more toned-down question with some additional value added.

1387
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We also saw that in your strategy. All our colleagues think that we give a high added value, but this high added value is, in fact, deductible.

1388
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:16,000
We are interested if you think what to do in this space, because we got a lot of questions from entrepreneurs who have more employees.

1389
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:29,000
The problem is that when people do SIN, I don't know, SP, and go to work directly for Tuino, it's a different scene if you have a bunch of employees.

1390
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm also interested if you are preparing any changes, if you have any plans.

1391
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Will this help us make more unicorns?

1392
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Back to the question.

1393
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I know this question. Everyone knows that it is for the Ministry of Finance and not for the Ministry of Digital Transformation.

1394
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
We have our opinion and we will share it when we come to the mid-resource assembly.

1395
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's not just about the Ministry of Finance, but it's about the decision-makers.

1396
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Why is this question important? I know it's a difficult question.

1397
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And I have to answer it politically.

1398
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yes, but why is it important? When we talked about the staff, in the same pool, you catch the staff from the Ministry,

1399
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
who catches them in the company, and then people make decisions.

1400
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
In the end, you live on the same card, you put it on the account. That's why this question was important.

1401
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Maybe you will also learn from this my way of thinking, as I said before,

1402
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that motivation is not always self-paying.

1403
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But there are also other mechanisms how you can motivate a person to work somewhere or not.

1404
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
OK.

1405
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You are so fucked up with the next question.

1406
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Why are you so fucked up with the next question? Have you already survived it?

1407
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
No, no, not at all. I don't have such a good memory.

1408
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I mean, this next question is more about the neutral Internet.

1409
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Again, we got this question from people, because it's a real question.

1410
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Maybe you would like to go on the Internet a bit more,

1411
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and talk a bit about the toxic environment in which we work.

1412
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Maybe you can tell us something about it.

1413
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Anyway, we got this question.

1414
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
We have been using the Internet for about 30 years.

1415
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
We all want a neutral Internet, which means less surveillance,

1416
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
we are more anonymous.

1417
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Shortly after that, we talked about e-privacy.

1418
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We would also like less online bullying, hate speech, and disinformation.

1419
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Now, big corporations, which are present in our country,

1420
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
and people use them through social networks,

1421
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:34,000
give a huge amount of resources, money, and human manpower

1422
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
to reduce the amount of non-privileged people on the Internet.

1423
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
As part of this neutral Internet, less information, disinformation,

1424
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
we are most interested in seeing the role of the state,

1425
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and maybe even your ministry, in creating a safe,

1426
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
acceptable, healthy Internet.

1427
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I can only react this way.

1428
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
E-privacy does not threaten our anonymity.

1429
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Due to the fact that there is a certain reputation

1430
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
that e-privacy will follow us far from it,

1431
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
nothing changes.

1432
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It is just a means of authentication for those

1433
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
who have a decent view of your data.

1434
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Let's just clear that up.

1435
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
No, no, no, it's clear.

1436
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
We often meet with this balance between technophobia,

1437
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
when people are afraid of new things,

1438
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and when they lose everything,

1439
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
and they need to be provided with benefits

1440
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
provided by technology.

1441
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So, that comment is spot on.

1442
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Great.

1443
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Absolutely.

1444
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Our principle is that the Internet can be free,

1445
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
open, independent.

1446
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
At the same time, we have a principle that everything

1447
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
that is illegal in the real world,

1448
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
can also be illegal on the Internet.

1449
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
If there is a breach in the Internet,

1450
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
it is only on the basis of the decision of the court,

1451
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
for example, when human rights are threatened,

1452
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
consumer rights, when democracy is threatened,

1453
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and so on.

1454
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So, there must be an order for legislation.

1455
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And that is exactly the role of the Ministry.

1456
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
To have carefully prepared legislation,

1457
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
that everything that is illegal in the real world

1458
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
can also be on the basis of the decision of the court.

1459
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
At the moment, we are working on the transfer,

1460
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
or implementation of the Act on Digital Services,

1461
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
which can be implemented by the end of February 2024,

1462
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
in our legal order.

1463
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Here, of course, these large platforms will also be included.

1464
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
There will also be a hate speech,

1465
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
or illegal, and not only illegal,

1466
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
but also legal, and still harmful,

1467
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
because there is a difference between them.

1468
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
What is this Act, can you introduce it a little?

1469
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
The Act on Digital Services deals with the fact

1470
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
that everything that is illegal on the Internet

1471
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
can be in the real world.

1472
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It is a European directive,

1473
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
which all member states must implement

1474
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
in their legal order.

1475
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
The key thing is that each member state

1476
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
will have a so-called national coordinator,

1477
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
which must be independent.

1478
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Regardless of who is in power,

1479
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
it must be independent.

1480
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And it will name so-called data-trusted flaggers.

1481
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I will not try to translate it into Slovenian now.

1482
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
For example, if there is a hate speech,

1483
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
or disinformation,

1484
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
then these data-trusted flaggers

1485
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
will communicate directly

1486
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
with the Very Large Online Platform,

1487
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
with 19 member states,

1488
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, and so on.

1489
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And they will have to remove these personalities.

1490
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So, there will be no need,

1491
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
for example, I am an old man,

1492
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
to use hate speech as a punitive action.

1493
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And what can I do?

1494
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I report it to the police,

1495
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
the police proceeds with the procedure,

1496
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
goes to the court,

1497
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
for example, I have been waiting for about a year,

1498
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and when I get it from the court,

1499
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
the platform can remove this personality.

1500
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
As soon as we have implemented it,

1501
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
then I report it to the data-trusted flagger,

1502
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
the data-trusted flagger goes to the platform,

1503
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and the platform must remove this personality.

1504
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
In other words,

1505
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
the technical execution of this whole investigation

1506
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
will then be simplified.

1507
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I mean, one of the tasks

1508
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
that we also see,

1509
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
as you mentioned, with hate speech,

1510
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
when we talked on those media,

1511
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and I don't know, here in the team,

1512
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
we have people who are inclusive,

1513
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
all together,

1514
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
someone will be able to determine

1515
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
whether they are bots,

1516
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
whether they are real in themselves,

1517
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
or, I don't know,

1518
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
it seems that people think

1519
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
that they are really anonymous,

1520
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
and that they can say anything,

1521
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
that technology enables them

1522
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
some degree of anonymity,

1523
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
but,

1524
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
would this act somehow help

1525
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
to de-anonymize, if that makes sense?

1526
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Because I see that people write everything

1527
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
because they think they are anonymous, or what?

1528
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yes, we already have this debate

1529
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
within the government,

1530
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
various ministries that deal with this,

1531
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
we are already looking for

1532
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
how to implement this question

1533
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
all over the world, not just in Europe,

1534
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
New Zealand and Australia

1535
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
are already working on this area,

1536
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and we will try to find

1537
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
an optimal solution,

1538
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
because on the one hand,

1539
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
it seems very simple,

1540
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
if you register for an electronic personal statement,

1541
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
you identify yourself, and then you don't have

1542
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
this anonymity, but on the other hand,

1543
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
we still don't solve it, and you will have more problems.

1544
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And we need to find a way

1545
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
to protect the freedom of speech,

1546
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
and at the same time,

1547
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
to take care of a culture

1548
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
of behavior and communication

1549
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
even on social networks.

1550
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I mean, whatever,

1551
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
in this area,

1552
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
it has certainly come in handy.

1553
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I think that

1554
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
people know too little

1555
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
about what is happening on these networks,

1556
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
until they are victims themselves

1557
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
from various creative beginnings.

1558
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Especially among young people, I see that

1559
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
they are still less aware

1560
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
of what is happening,

1561
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
what are the incidents,

1562
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and then there are big problems.

1563
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And maybe in this spirit,

1564
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I would continue this debate

1565
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
about digital literacy,

1566
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
because I think

1567
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
it is somehow connected.

1568
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I mean, how to be

1569
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
digitally literate

1570
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
in 2023,

1571
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
or in the future,

1572
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
somehow that could also be

1573
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
part of this curriculum,

1574
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
to be aware,

1575
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
to have some awareness of what you will hear

1576
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
in the digital space,

1577
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
so that these incidents will be there,

1578
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
maybe forever,

1579
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
maybe they will disappear,

1580
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
maybe they will be forever,

1581
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
but that they also have the characteristics

1582
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
of the things you hear in the digital space,

1583
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
can have real-world consequences,

1584
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
in the real world.

1585
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And it seems to me that

1586
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
from this perspective,

1587
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I think we assume

1588
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
that young people,

1589
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
because they are young,

1590
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
automatically digital first,

1591
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
they are already literate,

1592
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
they already know the technology.

1593
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
They are not literate.

1594
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
That's why I will continue.

1595
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And so it is.

1596
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
If we know how to use phones

1597
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and the most popular applications,

1598
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
maybe that is not enough today.

1599
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
If we have learned over time,

1600
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
in our generation,

1601
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
the word and the calculator

1602
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
are not enough

1603
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
for a digitally literate person.

1604
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Maybe we can turn

1605
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
a little differently.

1606
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
What are some of the skills

1607
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
that young people could learn,

1608
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
in your opinion?

1609
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Maybe we will be able to learn again,

1610
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I hope we will be able to learn

1611
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
what a computer is,

1612
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
also the concept of a

1613
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
file system,

1614
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
windows like that.

1615
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
These are some things

1616
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
that only we could learn,

1617
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
maybe the younger generation, but not more.

1618
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Especially those who grew up with a phone.

1619
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Yes, I'm interested.

1620
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
How are you?

1621
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
How did you start?

1622
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Because we talked about Heatspeak,

1623
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
and you started digital literacy.

1624
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I can continue.

1625
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I like it.

1626
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I have two daughters and a son.

1627
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
What skills do you think

1628
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
would be smart to learn

1629
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
in the coming years?

1630
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
How old are they?

1631
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Two and eight.

1632
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I also have eight sons.

1633
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And the best thing

1634
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
we are dealing with now

1635
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
is whether it is true or not,

1636
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
what he sees on YouTube.

1637
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
So we currently have fake news

1638
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and disinformation.

1639
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Because there was a time when he was

1640
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
completely scared that there would be a world war.

1641
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Because on YouTube it says

1642
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
that on October 26,

1643
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and we had

1644
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
a whole mess made up

1645
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
where we would hide,

1646
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
and we started to learn

1647
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
that not everything someone says on YouTube

1648
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
also holds ideals.

1649
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Which beliefs are negligible, which are not negligible.

1650
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So that's

1651
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
where we started.

1652
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And with digital literacy,

1653
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
until now,

1654
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
when I went to school,

1655
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
we programmed.

1656
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But at that time there were no social networks,

1657
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
there was no all of that.

1658
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Now, digital knowledge

1659
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
and competence are exactly determined.

1660
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Information and additional literacy,

1661
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
because that also falls,

1662
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
either it is for fake news

1663
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
or for disinformation.

1664
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Then we have the use of new technologies

1665
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
for communication

1666
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and cooperation.

1667
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
If we say that young digital writers

1668
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
are right, how many of them,

1669
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
how many students always wanted

1670
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
the whole class to prepare notes

1671
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
in digital tools.

1672
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Because I notice that in our ministry,

1673
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
almost everyone did not know how to use

1674
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
documents for joint creation of a document,

1675
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
which is something else.

1676
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
The next category here is

1677
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
the creation of new personalities.

1678
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Also what we do today is part of digital literacy.

1679
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
We don't just talk about PowerPoint,

1680
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
but you can also shoot something

1681
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
to present your work.

1682
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Then there is

1683
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
security at the meeting

1684
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
and solving problems

1685
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
with new technologies,

1686
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
which then comes to programming,

1687
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
artificial intelligence and so on.

1688
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Now, depending on the age,

1689
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
there should not be

1690
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
a special subject

1691
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
that we will call

1692
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
digital literacy or digitization

1693
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
or whatever, but you are

1694
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
one of those people who can

1695
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
get involved in already existing subjects.

1696
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Or rather, you have to get involved

1697
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
in already existing subjects.

1698
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
There are a lot of questions

1699
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
that will probably be

1700
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
on the learning system itself,

1701
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
how we will prepare the class,

1702
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
how we will teach the class

1703
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and motivate the teachers

1704
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
to take this time,

1705
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
a little older.

1706
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
We also have to

1707
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
attract teachers

1708
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
first,

1709
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
because we think

1710
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
they will see

1711
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
what kind of skills

1712
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
there are in this area.

1713
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
First, we have to

1714
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
introduce these technologies to the teachers,

1715
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
to avoid

1716
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
technophobia,

1717
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
because some teachers think

1718
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
that with new technologies

1719
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
it will no longer be necessary for them to be present.

1720
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Apart from that,

1721
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
we will need

1722
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
the best teachers

1723
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
for new technologies.

1724
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And it is also necessary

1725
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
for faculties where teachers are being educated

1726
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
to be included in the curriculum,

1727
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
to know how to work

1728
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
with these new technologies.

1729
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And this will not happen today,

1730
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
in the morning. And now, on the one hand,

1731
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
we are also working on the Ministry,

1732
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
we are performing informal

1733
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
education and training,

1734
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
but again, this will not be enough.

1735
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It will be necessary to do everything together

1736
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
even more formally.

1737
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Can I ask a purely practical question?

1738
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
For example,

1739
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
what happened to you?

1740
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You are in a larger organization,

1741
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
a decision comes from above,

1742
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
now you will use some XY software.

1743
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
From tomorrow on,

1744
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
maybe education, maybe not,

1745
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
maybe all-relevant education,

1746
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and from that time on,

1747
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
you will use this software,

1748
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
because we have decided so.

1749
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Do you have any advice?

1750
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Because experience

1751
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and research

1752
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
says that people

1753
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
learn from changes.

1754
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And people need to

1755
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
change,

1756
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
give, pack,

1757
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and tell them

1758
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
why we do it.

1759
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And I'm also interested

1760
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
how you actually

1761
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
try to sell these changes

1762
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
to people at the end of the day.

1763
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Because if Andraž doesn't know

1764
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
what the advantage of this software is,

1765
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
he probably won't want to use it.

1766
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And you just said

1767
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
your question.

1768
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
We can never say

1769
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
we will do it because I said so,

1770
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
but we have to say

1771
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
what the advantage is.

1772
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And also with teachers,

1773
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
we will not use

1774
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
new software in Python

1775
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
because he is a minister

1776
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
or president of the government

1777
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
or director of the Institute for Education,

1778
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
but because

1779
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
students will get such skills

1780
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
and your work will be more successful,

1781
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
your work will be easier.

1782
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You have to tell people

1783
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
what's in it for me.

1784
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
After all, we all come out of it

1785
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
that we want to get something,

1786
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
some benefit.

1787
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I myself worked on projects for smart education.

1788
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And when we

1789
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
offered new technologies,

1790
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
the Internet of Things

1791
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
to farmers,

1792
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
we didn't say because we want green education

1793
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and digital education

1794
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
for children.

1795
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I don't know if there will be costs

1796
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
because you will know

1797
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
easier whether it has come to some disease.

1798
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
We told them

1799
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
what benefits they will have

1800
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
from using

1801
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
new technologies.

1802
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
No, if it were Deops,

1803
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
or if it were that tooling monster,

1804
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
then I would know how much

1805
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I have to give money in time.

1806
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
We will simply

1807
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
distribute where we can

1808
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
profit,

1809
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
so we don't have to look

1810
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
at the code anymore.

1811
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
We have two consequences.

1812
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
One, if we can automate it,

1813
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Linter will fix it.

1814
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
We can ask one more question.

1815
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
We were talking about

1816
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
some tools.

1817
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
What is it now

1818
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
when we see this commercial breakthrough

1819
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
of the next generation of artificial intelligence

1820
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
with large language models,

1821
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
chat prompts?

1822
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It seems that a lot of people

1823
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
and let's leave those

1824
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
who are driving,

1825
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
but a lot of people

1826
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
have a little

1827
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
delay, or rather

1828
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
a technophobia that

1829
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
this technology can

1830
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
automate a lot of my work.

1831
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
If I am satisfied

1832
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
that we are using it now, then I will be absolutely satisfied.

1833
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
This means that we will be able

1834
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
to quickly learn

1835
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
what to do with this technology,

1836
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
how to use it.

1837
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Or use it.

1838
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I would like to hear that.

1839
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
What do you see in this space?

1840
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
How will we use it?

1841
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
We have to be so smart

1842
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and use this technology

1843
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
to help us,

1844
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
so that we can be even better.

1845
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
If I, as a researcher,

1846
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
now this technology helps me

1847
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
to get here,

1848
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
it means that I can go from here

1849
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
forward,

1850
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
save my time

1851
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
so that I can work

1852
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
even better.

1853
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Everyone who has used

1854
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
chat with GPT is currently the best.

1855
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Not everything he does is true.

1856
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
If you know this area,

1857
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
it can save you

1858
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
a lot of initial work.

1859
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
But from here on,

1860
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
you can see how good or bad you are.

1861
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I see this as an additional

1862
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
tool.

1863
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
We have to communicate

1864
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
with each other.

1865
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
In some way,

1866
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
we will need some kind of

1867
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
regulation.

1868
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I am aiming for fake videos.

1869
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
In the EU,

1870
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
everyone is thinking about it.

1871
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Artificial intelligence,

1872
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
but

1873
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
personally,

1874
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I don't care about technology.

1875
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I care about people.

1876
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Because I don't trust

1877
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
people to remember

1878
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
for what purpose

1879
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
they will use this technology.

1880
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That's why we need regulation.

1881
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Through history, we have found

1882
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
a lot of people who use technology

1883
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
for other good things.

1884
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
This is probably

1885
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
the question of artificial intelligence.

1886
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Will it help us

1887
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
to regulate

1888
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
these things

1889
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
so that we won't do...

1890
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yes, on the one hand...

1891
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Can it be legalized?

1892
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's very difficult.

1893
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Because laws are

1894
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
very slow

1895
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
processes.

1896
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And it's true.

1897
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
When you work with laws, you have to think about everything.

1898
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
On the other hand, we are talking about

1899
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
technologies that develop extremely fast.

1900
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
What do we want for regulation?

1901
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
For regulation, we want

1902
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
to maximize the benefits.

1903
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
On the other hand,

1904
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
to reduce the risks.

1905
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Artificial intelligence is a technology

1906
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
that is developing.

1907
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
We don't know yet what benefits

1908
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
it will bring us.

1909
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
We don't know all the risks.

1910
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
If we work with laws,

1911
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
then it's even worse.

1912
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Because the process is slow.

1913
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
What do we need to start talking about?

1914
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
We have a huge debate

1915
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
about the United Nations

1916
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and about the world of Europe.

1917
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
They are our news.

1918
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
We need to start

1919
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
about ethics by design

1920
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
in artificial intelligence.

1921
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
We need to agree

1922
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
to have a consensus

1923
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
about the rules we will use

1924
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
when creating new technologies.

1925
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So that we don't come to the point

1926
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
of regulation.

1927
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
regulation as we would like it to be.

1928
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
What I notice globally,

1929
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
what is happening is that maybe

1930
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
some countries will regulate less

1931
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
just because they will come faster to some breakthroughs.

1932
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But here we have to ask ourselves what we want.

1933
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Because some countries will do that.

1934
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Some countries, at the end,

1935
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
use these technologies, for example,

1936
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
mostly for monitoring their existence.

1937
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Do we want that? I personally do not want that.

1938
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Some countries are going exclusively for commercialization

1939
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
and are probably more successful.

1940
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
The goal of Europe is still to establish

1941
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
human rights, consumer rights,

1942
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
the protection of personal data in advance.

1943
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And I personally think that is right.

1944
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
That is, we all want

1945
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
that it will be used less,

1946
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
as we said, face recognition,

1947
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
connection of some...

1948
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
We are reducing the possibility of hacking of technology.

1949
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Okay.

1950
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Now it's going to be hard.

1951
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
It was the most interesting.

1952
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
In the last segment, we prepared a few questions

1953
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
more about you.

1954
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
We studied your questions first.

1955
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
We started with the ministry.

1956
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
And we were like, okay,

1957
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
you are a minister, you have a great role.

1958
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So we said, okay,

1959
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
we will have more of these fake topics at the end.

1960
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Now, in your career, you have done

1961
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
a lot of research, academic work.

1962
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
That is, health, smart cities,

1963
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
socialization, support.

1964
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
How and why did you jump from

1965
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
some academic research world

1966
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
to politics?

1967
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
When I started working at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering,

1968
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I was using a tool,

1969
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
a psychological tool,

1970
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
which tells you what your profile is, what it means to you.

1971
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And all the psychological tests I took

1972
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
showed that impact means the most to me.

1973
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And where you can make the biggest impact,

1974
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
if you can look at it that way,

1975
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
is in politics, in creating real politicians.

1976
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And maybe just from that word,

1977
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
because I was doing everything in the economy,

1978
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I started my career in the economy,

1979
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
a beautiful experience.

1980
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And I would also like all colleagues in universities and faculties

1981
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
to work in a large international field,

1982
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
because there were different sectors, special development,

1983
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
special marketing, where I learned that

1984
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
if you work in the same field, you speak a different language

1985
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
and you can learn to talk to your colleagues.

1986
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Then I worked at a university,

1987
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
which is again a different world, a research work,

1988
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
a teaching work, you also make a huge impact,

1989
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
if you can see it that way.

1990
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Then I started working on European projects,

1991
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
this change, experience, knowledge.

1992
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And that's when I first touched on policymaking,

1993
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
because we talked a lot about policymaking

1994
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
through Interac Europe,

1995
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
and I saw what effect you can actually achieve

1996
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
with that work.

1997
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
This policymaking,

1998
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
you mentioned it many times in previous interviews,

1999
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
what is the main difference between a policymaker

2000
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
and a politician?

2001
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
A policymaker doesn't have to be a member of a political party

2002
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
to establish a policy.

2003
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
A politician often doesn't deal

2004
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
so much with establishing a policy,

2005
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
but with making an agenda.

2006
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So you see yourself more as an engineer than a policymaker?

2007
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yes.

2008
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Now,

2009
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
when we were preparing this podcast,

2010
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
we tried to put together a bunch of questions

2011
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
that maybe some of you couldn't predict.

2012
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Let's say,

2013
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Interac or CGPT,

2014
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
that means they're not copy-pastes

2015
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
from Digital Slovenia 2030,

2016
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
because it's a bit different,

2017
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
because we're not professional journalists.

2018
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
What are you talking about?

2019
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
It's a good thing we have,

2020
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
maybe we had more time as professional journalists

2021
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
to think about these questions.

2022
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Tomorrow we don't have to write new columns.

2023
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Now, we were wondering,

2024
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
OK, we don't have to ask you

2025
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
questions that would activate

2026
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
a bunch of Twitter bots,

2027
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
let's put it that way.

2028
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
How do you look at this communication

2029
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
through social media?

2030
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
For example...

2031
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I don't look at the questions I would ask.

2032
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It would be like this.

2033
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Because someone doesn't like how I write.

2034
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Someone would get stuck in what I'm wearing today.

2035
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
These are people

2036
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
who don't have anything smart.

2037
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I also get e-mails

2038
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
asking where I came from.

2039
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But someone won't like it

2040
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and will ask me where I got my Slavic clothes from.

2041
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I just let it go.

2042
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I don't even choose those comments anymore.

2043
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I decided to ignore

2044
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
the comments of certain journalists.

2045
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
The worst thing for me

2046
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
is that you have children.

2047
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I don't know how,

2048
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
but somehow these comments come to my child.

2049
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And my child has to think

2050
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
about what to write about his mother.

2051
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
That's the worst and the hardest.

2052
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Yes.

2053
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It feels like a war zone.

2054
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
That's the word.

2055
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Even when we were preparing for this,

2056
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
we really tried to focus on ourselves.

2057
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And now we know

2058
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
that we will definitely get some messages back.

2059
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
But we tried to get that personality.

2060
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Because it seems important to us.

2061
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
For everyone.

2062
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
For everyone.

2063
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And we didn't like those parts.

2064
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I think we will be able to think strategically.

2065
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
We will hold on if we want to make breakthroughs.

2066
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yes.

2067
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
You can also build a filter

2068
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
so that what is written there

2069
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
doesn't have a daily state in the real world.

2070
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And vice versa.

2071
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I would like to talk about

2072
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
your online presence.

2073
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
In Grodje we are working

2074
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
through trial and error.

2075
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
There are three important segments in Grodje.

2076
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
First we start with pre-preparation.

2077
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Who will host?

2078
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Then we have recording.

2079
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Post-production and everything else.

2080
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And the third part

2081
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
where we need to pack the personality

2082
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and give it a nice picture

2083
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
and sell it to our audience.

2084
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So that they can consume it.

2085
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
All those parts are extremely important.

2086
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And if we do all the production

2087
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
and marketing

2088
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and if we don't pack the personality

2089
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
and if we don't work on it

2090
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and if we will do it and if we did it

2091
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
then it's too soon to say goodbye.

2092
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
We have learned that it's very important

2093
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
to tell people what you do

2094
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and communicate with them.

2095
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And my question is

2096
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
how do you balance that focus?

2097
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Because if you don't tell people what you do

2098
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
then they won't know.

2099
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I agree.

2100
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And it's often in this problem

2101
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
because we already have a lot in Slovenia.

2102
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
We already exist in Slovenia.

2103
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
But people don't know that it exists.

2104
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Even in our ministry

2105
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
where all digital content is free

2106
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and everyone can use it.

2107
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And we are looking for new ways

2108
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
how to present it to people.

2109
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
You have a similar problem

2110
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
of seeking attention

2111
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
because you need to tell people

2112
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
what you do.

2113
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
You need to get people's attention

2114
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
so that they will know about it.

2115
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So that it doesn't look like propaganda.

2116
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
That was one of the questions

2117
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
or the guidelines for this episode.

2118
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I hope there won't be another PR.

2119
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I hope we managed to break it

2120
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
and get to the last important questions.

2121
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
These are short ones.

2122
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
These are a bunch of short questions.

2123
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
We said that this is not purely PR.

2124
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
What would two engineers ask you

2125
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
if you weren't a journalist?

2126
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Which operating system do you like

2127
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
the most for daily use?

2128
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
That's a typical question.

2129
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I can say that I use MacOS and Windows

2130
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
every day.

2131
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Which is your favorite

2132
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
programming language and tool?

2133
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
That's a common question.

2134
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
You can probably answer it yourself.

2135
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It's not necessary.

2136
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Why do I like Java the most?

2137
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
It was the first solution

2138
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
that I programmed

2139
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and that went into production

2140
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
and then came to life.

2141
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I was working on GSMR

2142
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
and it was programmed in Java.

2143
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Maybe it was the beginning of my career

2144
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
and the first product that came to life.

2145
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Which framework would you use in Grodno?

2146
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
No!

2147
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Those were the electrical ones.

2148
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
That's just the protocol.

2149
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
It has to be on GUMP.

2150
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
That's a question that you love.

2151
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
That's a daily tool.

2152
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I mean a tool.

2153
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
No, that's a daily tool.

2154
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I wrote that down.

2155
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Are you interested in playing video games?

2156
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Have you ever played?

2157
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
What's your opinion on that?

2158
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I'll start again.

2159
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Right now I play FIFA

2160
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
and we have it at home

2161
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
until 2015 and every year later.

2162
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I can't play it at home yet

2163
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
but I think it's the best.

2164
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Two or three controllers

2165
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
and let's go.

2166
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
We had a question about NK Maribor

2167
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
and then we moved on.

2168
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Which is the best football club?

2169
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Itak.

2170
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Itak is a champion.

2171
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It's a celebration from the last season.

2172
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
We moved on to the end.

2173
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I would like to thank you

2174
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
for your speech.

2175
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
If you want to name the audience

2176
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
for the last thought before we move on.

2177
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Maybe I would say

2178
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
that the day before I became a minister

2179
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I didn't think about what they do

2180
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
at the ministry.

2181
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Now, when you look at it from the inside

2182
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
you see that you have done something.

2183
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
When do they have a problem with marketing?

2184
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
When do they have a problem with various trusts

2185
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
that they are trying to solve?

2186
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Maybe a little more patience

2187
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
and a little more constructiveness would not hurt.

2188
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Thank you.

2189
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I would like to thank all the listeners

2190
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
and viewers.

2191
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I would also like to thank all the supporters

2192
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
on Patreon.

2193
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Thank you for being with us and listening to us.

2194
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Thank you to all the team for your effort.

2195
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Thank you both for your time.

2196
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Good luck.

2197
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Thank you.
