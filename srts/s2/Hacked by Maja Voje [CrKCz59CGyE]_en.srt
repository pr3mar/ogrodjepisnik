1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ok, at the beginning it's a bit awkward, because at the beginning there has to be silence so that Dejan can pick up the sounds of the ambience,

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and at the end there has to be silence so that it can properly give sound.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But today, unlike last year when we were at the Interprofessional Board in Celje,

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
today we are in our co-working slash hackerspace.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So it's a bit more soft.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I totally miss most of those intros, so I'm talking about completely irrelevant things.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But yeah, now that the jingle has run out, it's time to introduce the guest.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Maja Voje, hello.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Long time no see, thank you for inviting me. I've been waiting for this for two years.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now, I've been waiting, I said two years, now it's time for you to come to Belgrade.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But yeah, a lot of our ideas have to mature somehow, they have to come to a point where we are all somehow for that action,

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and now I'm ready for you to write your book, and now you just need to publish it.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In thirty days.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I know it's quite a big project for you, and now I think it's time for us to welcome you.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, that's that part, why, okay.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now, when I wrote that Maja Voje would come to Belgrade, I also got a question from our audience,

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
why, what does it have to do with Belgrade?

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You have programming here, and you have some hardcore programmers.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What does Maja Voje have to do with what you do?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, I'll just step back a bit, and I'll tell you what we're trying to achieve in Belgrade,

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so that this question is answered a bit.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, in Belgrade, we have two separate groups, one of them is deep tech,

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
deep topics in programming, technology, and development.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And then, on the other side, we're trying to create two separate groups,

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
which are topics that are connected to the fact that you can do deep tech.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And that's what we have inside, from entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, to housing in Slovenia,

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to UX design, and so on.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And these things have to work together, they have to work together,

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and that's why I think we absolutely can't do it without talking about the topics that are close to you,

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
that you represent.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, that's my intro.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, no, thank you very much.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know, I've also been working with programmers for 10 years, I have impostor syndrome.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But I've been working in the technology industry for a long time,

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and if you don't know how to program, they give you a degree in OECM,

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
a little bit of HR, a little bit of accounting,

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in fact, you also bake pancakes on Fridays.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, you know, I've never really felt that I really belong inside.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And also, you know, we're in the group Growth Hacking Slovenia,

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which also has programmers inside.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But I have a crazy fear at times, because I know that you are the most critical thinkers,

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and that you see bullshit all over you.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And so, most of the tech economists are like a horde of golden carriers.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's like, we see something, we get excited, we go, and there's no panic.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And so, to be honest, I see a very good barrier if we participate.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Because I've also done a lot of research for the book Go-to-Market Strategies,

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and, for example, marketing people didn't understand those books at all.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Most of them.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And e-commerce people even less.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I mean, there was a technical founder, product managers,

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and those who were already established.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And sometimes, you know, when we work, for example, on a freelance job,

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
when we already have 130 people who have helped us open businesses,

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I would almost say that programmers are the easiest,

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
not the easiest because, I don't know, it would underestimate how hard it is to do it,

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
but here the challenge is very big.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And if you learn a little bit about business, but it's so little,

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean, if I could learn programming,

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it would be almost ten times longer process,

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
because you will learn a little bit about business.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And yes, I think in all these years, I hope we will be able to tell you

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
in such a transparent and understandable way,

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
if not, then you will correct me.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I am...

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, we might come back to this later,

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but I also did a test,

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and I asked five colleagues, good programmers,

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
who Maja Vojana is.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No, I'm kidding, because nothing would happen to me.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nothing would happen to me.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No, but they are very interesting speakers.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
For example, out of five, four knew that you exist.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's good.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's very good.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's great.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's great.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Without a YouTube voice, great.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's great.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It seems to me that marketing and sales

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
are also full of people who understand what you do,

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and a lot of people have the same...

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Eh, this is some kind of marketing, and then they decide.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Full version, yes.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes, and there is a lot of that.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Now, we can go back to where we started.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In the beginning, programmers and people who work with this technology

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
solve problems on some basis.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There is a very different range of problems.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Most of the examples, after we come to today's lecture,

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
we go to the fact that people solve themselves.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But when it comes to marketing and sales,

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think you can work with a lot of people,

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and you can have a lot of human touch.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And these are not always the same people who have the same traits,

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
who are interested in the same things.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What do you think about that?

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, fair.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I would say, as a common denominator,

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I met everyone who said, we solve problems.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When it comes to marketing and sales,

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
we also think that we solve problems,

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
but the difference is that maybe we come from a different prism.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And here I am, working with the Swiss e-commerce company,

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
with technical founders, and in all Balkan countries,

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
because the state of Switzerland sponsors it, thanks to Switzerland,

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the difference is that we have an exceptional technical talent here.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then you ask yourself, purely pragmatically,

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
will the next time I come from Slovenia,

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know, some dropshipper,

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
some kind of wannabe Chinese bitch,

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
no, no, it won't be.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, it will, it's such a nice exit for the founder,

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but the added value of it is limited to the optimization

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
of the lifestyle of some people,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
except if they go to SAS later.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And here I saw such a bias,

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
when it comes to the environment,

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
exactly what you said, it touches people, right?

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What is most natural for me?

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
For example, let's solve such a problem,

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
let's do a mental experiment.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How would you get 100 users,

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and how would I get 100 users for my product?

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How would you get them?

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now that we have a podcast.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes, for example, it's easy,

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but let's say we have a new solution,

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
which you have here in the laboratory,

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
how would you get your first 100 users?

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm probably not the most...

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, you know, how would you do it?

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm probably not the most intelligent,

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm usually a little biased,

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
because I'm not the best example of that.

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're really biased.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, but I'm currently on LinkedIn,

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
for example, the biggest profile,

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
there I have the most friends, followers,

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
shit, I won't cut it with me,

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but they are my close friends.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You already have 6,000, right? 6,000.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, and there I have a big following,

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
so I would probably post the easiest on LinkedIn.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The second part is probably...

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I would probably develop this podcast

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
in an interesting way,

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
or, I don't know, on some online community.

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That would probably be a no-brainer,

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and the most valuable.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You can also refer to this podcast,

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
in fact, that's exactly our marketing,

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
especially market strategy, if you want.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And in fact,

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we built our podcast to that point

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
without throwing money into advertising.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Not really,

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
but without buying ads.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Everything we built,

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we built organically

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and without any ads.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now, how do we finance this?

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Again, another question,

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but today we convinced people

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to listen from the beginning.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In the first episode,

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
maybe it wasn't smart to listen at all,

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but today, this personal network

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
was the easiest to activate.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now, at some point,

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
if I remember correctly,

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we also decided that

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
we don't care if this podcast

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
would be listened by millions of people,

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
but we want to know

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
what is the maximum size

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that we can reach in this space.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We said that this is our strategy,

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
that we will be present in this technological space

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and that we will try to do the most inside.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We are aware of this,

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
that's why we are targeting and moving inside.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We also have stickers in the garden,

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and we also sent them by mail to the fans.

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This helps us a lot.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Of course, people who work on your product

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
also work on other people's products,

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
so this part also works.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Now I don't know if this fits more into marketing

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
or sales, but it will.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm giving you a second year of economics

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
to get things in order,

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
because you're already doing some things

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
very, very, very, very well.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But if I look at the technical partners

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I work with,

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
they want to get in touch with people

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
at all costs.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They won't do interviews,

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
they will start sales,

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
so they won't go to their...

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is this a myth or is it true?

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What?

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Is this a myth or is it true?

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No, it's true.

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh my God, oh my God.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What if it's offloaded?

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, sorry.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Look, people have been paying me

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
for my mentoring job

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
so that we can write emails together.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because it's weird for them to write emails.

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And look, this week,

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
tomorrow is my day,

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
which is for Y Combinator,

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and we're holding on to them.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But the question we have to solve

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
is how to get 500 applications for Beto.

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And they ran some LinkedIn

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and did some outreach campaigns

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and such things.

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I think,

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
my assumption is that

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
a typical technical founder

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is afraid of contact with people,

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
while contact with people is the easiest.

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Because what would I do?

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For the first 100 users,

229
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I would send an email,

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
hello, I did something new,

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you know, on the split page,

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and see if you're interested.

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Before that,

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I would test my stuff

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
for 200 people for feedback.

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You also participate in my research,

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't know if you know that,

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
but you're my favorite tester,

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
because you know how to think critically.

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And so, you know,

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm always good at looking at things

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
through the prism of what is mission critical.

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So what do I want to do now?

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What does mission critical mean?

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Mission critical means

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
you have a goal,

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and what will drive you to your goal,

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
because then you can think like a horse.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And what is the best horse harness?

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
These are Russian horses.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They have to be at 80%,

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but they have to see the nature itself.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So in any case,

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you know,

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the amount of ballast

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
that you remove from your life

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to go against the natural lines,

258
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
with a goal,

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that's crazy

260
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
when you have such a very aggressive goal.

261
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And for example,

262
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
those 500 founders,

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and also the two of us with Tim,

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
as we said at the beginning of the year,

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
we both want to reach 100 followers this year.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

267
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And I'm not interested in anything else,

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but how can we get 100 followers

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to live a better life.

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And that's for me,

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think it's a little bit of ADHD,

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but that's how I live.

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I function the best when you give me a goal,

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and when we go to that goal,

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
because it helps me decide.

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How do you choose a goal?

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I make it up.

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know,

279
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
but sometimes you have to calculate something,

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
but you give it.

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Because,

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
thank you so much for asking me this,

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
for the goal.

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Here we have another problem,

285
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
everyone in Slovenia and in the region,

286
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
we underestimate our work.

287
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And that's because they sell consulting,

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and stories,

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and also in the product part.

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Here, Simon Belak always told me,

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
raise, raise, double,

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
maybe add another zero.

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But the fact is,

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
you know,

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
because of the sociocultural heritage,

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we come out of a kind of prism,

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is it okay that I deserve more

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
than my mother?

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Is it okay,

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean,

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
speaking in cash,

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
is it okay that I know

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that if I used to work for 5 euros,

304
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
now I have about 10 euros a month.

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And in terms of pricing,

306
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and in terms of consulting,

307
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
we are really the most weird in the world.

308
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No,

309
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
we still have it,

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
it's a real problem,

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
but.

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a little wrong for us to sell,

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
if we go back to those 100 and 100 users,

314
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
it's wrong for us to sell

315
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
to those 100 users,

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
some part.

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes,

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and you feel fully responsible

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
when you sell it.

320
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Because,

321
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
especially in such products,

322
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
you know,

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
they affect human life.

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
For example,

325
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
even if you work,

326
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't know,

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
what kind of health technology,

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and so on.

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I,

330
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
now,

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
really,

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
when I get a support mail,

333
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and I ask it,

334
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to look at LinkedIn,

335
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm going to talk,

336
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and I'm going to put it in touch

337
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
with some other source,

338
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
which is close to a similar profile,

339
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
because I feel,

340
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
in fact,

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
such a huge responsibility,

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
right?

343
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then,

344
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
in fact,

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
your ethical or moral responsibility

346
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
of which products

347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you will then push forward,

348
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
right?

349
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Also,

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
probably for your podcast,

351
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you know exactly,

352
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
look,

353
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
you took the conditions

354
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
with which you do well,

355
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and now,

356
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm not going to name

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
one company,

358
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm going to name my

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
growth lab,

360
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to sponsor your podcast,

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
so that you would have

362
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
such a mission critical,

363
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
GTM strategies,

364
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
so that you would have

365
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
that thing,

366
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
mission critical.

367
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I mean,

368
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that appears to me,

369
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
interesting problems

370
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
appear to us,

371
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
right?

372
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes.

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because,

374
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
there are companies

375
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
with which you want

376
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
to somehow connect,

377
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and you ask them,

378
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and then,

379
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
then you have

380
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
such a company,

381
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
when you think,

382
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
oh,

383
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
how can I write

384
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
a book,

385
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
how can I

386
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
have such a friendly

387
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
kiss?

388
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And you heard stories,

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
right?

390
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I mean,

391
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
there are people

392
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
you trust.

393
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes,

394
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and it's not

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
that bad,

396
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
simply.

397
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean,

398
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
look,

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
now that you've

400
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
published a book,

401
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
it will be forever

402
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
on the internet.

403
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes,

404
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
OK,

405
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
now we're warmed up.

406
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now we're really

407
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
full of topics here.

408
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yes.

409
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So,

410
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
before we listen to

411
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that GTM strategy,

412
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
let's go back

413
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to the topic.

414
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
For you,

415
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
it's now

416
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
3.5 years,

417
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I looked,

418
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
3 years and 5 months.

419
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Thank you.

420
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Since you started

421
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
releasing in your

422
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
first episode

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
of the podcast

424
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Renaissance,

425
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
with that

426
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
great

427
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
French

428
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Chanson.

429
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Chanson,

430
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
yes.

431
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And,

432
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you really had,

433
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That French

434
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Chanson.

435
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You really had

436
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
an exceptional

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
palette

438
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
of guests.

439
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Today,

440
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
this morning,

441
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I listened to one

442
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
with Rok Hrastnik.

443
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But,

444
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
you're the one

445
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
who went to the show.

446
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're the one

447
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
who went to the show,

448
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
not the guest.

449
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Well,

450
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
look,

451
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I want to say

452
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that I listened

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to a few of them,

454
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that you really

455
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
contributed a lot

456
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to the marketing,

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
sales,

458
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
space,

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and also

460
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
wider.

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And then,

462
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you have

463
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
a huge frequency,

464
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
a really

465
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
big frequency,

466
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that we have,

467
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
for example,

468
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
when we,

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
when you have

470
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
a lot of

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
guests.

472
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll talk about

473
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the meeting,

474
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
when we have it

475
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
in Grodno.

476
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Really,

477
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
congratulations

478
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
for this achievement.

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hey,

480
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I thank you so much,

481
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because,

482
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
you know,

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
here again,

484
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Impostor Syndrome

485
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
strikes me out,

486
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
because you are

487
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
one of the smartest

488
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
people I know.

489
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes,

490
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
good,

491
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Simon Bilak.

492
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay,

493
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
okay,

494
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
okay.

495
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No,

496
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
but,

497
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
you know,

498
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
as far as I'm concerned,

499
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
we did

500
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
not spend

501
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
four years

502
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
on economic

503
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
development,

504
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
not like

505
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
marketing,

506
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
business,

507
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
let's go,

508
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
but that we

509
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
were able to

510
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
slowly,

511
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
slowly,

512
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
slowly,

513
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
move forward.

514
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And we're trying

515
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
to do that,

516
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think,

517
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
in a group

518
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
called

519
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Growth Hacking,

520
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
because I really

521
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
really believe

522
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
in cooperation,

523
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I believe in

524
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
critical thinking,

525
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and if I

526
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
told you

527
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
what episode

528
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I didn't

529
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
watch,

530
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you would

531
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
say,

532
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
oh,

533
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
represent

534
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the market

535
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
share,

536
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
make the

537
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
competitor bubbles

538
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
different in

539
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
size according

540
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
to their market

541
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
share.

542
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And that

543
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
wasn't

544
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
fun.

545
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I stopped

546
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
recording

547
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and then

548
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
like,

549
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
let's change

550
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
one more

551
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
episode,

552
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
let's prepare

553
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
something,

554
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
so that

555
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
this episode

556
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
will work

557
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
organically.

558
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm sorry

559
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
that someone

560
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
has to write

561
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
ten pages,

562
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
it's too much

563
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
for me.

564
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Could you

565
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
send the

566
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
questions forward?

567
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I always

568
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
send the

569
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
questions forward,

570
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
because I

571
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
mostly worked

572
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
with people

573
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
who are not

574
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
so well-trained

575
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
in the media,

576
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and then you

577
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
get someone

578
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
who is

579
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the first

580
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
person

581
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
with a microphone,

582
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and I

583
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
told

584
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
young women

585
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
that the

586
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
best thing

587
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
about being

588
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
a woman

589
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is that

590
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm not

591
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
afraid

592
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
of being

593
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
filmed.

594
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000

being filmed.

597
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's

598
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
not a

599
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
big deal,

600
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
are

989
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
supposed

990
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
to

991
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
be

992
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that

993
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
in

994
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,400
to produce more content, not so much attention in the zone, so that people can eat it all.

995
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Does that make sense?

996
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,799
In a total sense, and it can also be related to who you serve, right?

997
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,200
For example, most of these people, sorry, I said on Instagram, and that's not easy,

998
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,280
I mean, Darwin, a critical thinker, that's not easy.

999
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,360
You put it up there and then it's like, wow, you look good today.

1000
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
It's a different audience.

1001
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,119
And I understand that your audience has higher criteria.

1002
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,040
I also, for example, when I work with Ben Williams from SNIK,

1003
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,439
and here with Boss, with Wes Bush, I also put more effort into it.

1004
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:48,160
And I'm also 30 years old when I talk about intros.

1005
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,439
But I think it's a bit of a problem for the local environment.

1006
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:56,080
I took it totally easy because it could have been fun for me.

1007
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
That was the primary agenda.

1008
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,200
And here, I fully respect what you did.

1009
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

1010
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,199
What did we do?

1011
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,199
Sorry, what did you do with the team?

1012
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,919
I'm talking to myself now, it's a bit messy, I'm adjusting.

1013
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:19,120
But I don't know if she would be prepared to put so much will and so much discipline into such a project.

1014
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:21,199
I didn't see it that way.

1015
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:27,120
Because R.O.I. said it openly in the Slovenian podcast I had.

1016
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,519
I had maybe 20 sponsors, I don't know if, I would say 15.

1017
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,519
So that was one such thing.

1018
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,519
I did more for people who were my guests.

1019
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,160
I know what kind of business they started out of it.

1020
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,440
I always saw it as a platform.

1021
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,400
Because you give a person who ultimately is not well-known, but is good.

1022
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,279
Of course, like Hrastnik, who is well-known and good.

1023
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,000
But I always saw it as a jumping board for someone's career.

1024
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,279
And if I could help someone, I don't know, for a business, for 10-20K,

1025
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,279
if I could get some new pages out of it.

1026
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,279
That was top for me. That was amazing for me.

1027
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,080
To talk to a new generation of people.

1028
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,720
I think the most I got from the podcast is talent.

1029
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
New members of the community.

1030
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Because I think both of you have communities on Facebook.

1031
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,440
And the younger generation doesn't want to be on Facebook.

1032
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,119
And many of them use Facebook just because of our groups.

1033
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,119
We've probably heard that too, haven't we?

1034
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,119
Yes.

1035
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,119
But, yes, added value.

1036
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,119
Look, I don't know.

1037
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,119
Why did I let them do it?

1038
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,119
Because I wanted to make an impact,

1039
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,119
spread it through the English language.

1040
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,119
And somehow, after three and a half years,

1041
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,119
it wasn't a challenge anymore.

1042
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
I didn't want to go pro, like Otto and the team.

1043
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
It should have been more.

1044
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
But, no, I mean,

1045
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
for the book, I wrote in English.

1046
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Why? Because, look,

1047
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
I have two million people here in Slovenia,

1048
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
I love my language,

1049
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
I love my people,

1050
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I will always help them, I will always mentor them,

1051
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I will always work in the community.

1052
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
It's a little selfish for me,

1053
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
but if you do so much research,

1054
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
and if you produce such a level of knowledge,

1055
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
like I did last year,

1056
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,919
and then I said a thousand things no,

1057
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,919
and then I wrote,

1058
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,919
and did five interviews,

1059
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,919
and did science,

1060
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,919
so that I could then position

1061
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,919
this healthy biography, I don't know,

1062
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,919
of Franz Josef,

1063
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,919
I don't name anyone else.

1064
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,919
They washed a lot of news for us,

1065
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,919
but OK, we'll start with that.

1066
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,919
That's how they are.

1067
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,919
As long as we're normal.

1068
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,919
As long as we're normal.

1069
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
When we were at the beginning of our podcast,

1070
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I think we talked

1071
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
in Ljubljana,

1072
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
and I think

1073
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
at that time

1074
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
there was

1075
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
some kind of

1076
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
duet about it.

1077
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
I'm always a duet,

1078
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
everything else is overthinking.

1079
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Duet, and you gave me

1080
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
a lot of your

1081
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
direct experience,

1082
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
and readings,

1083
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
and at the end

1084
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
when you concluded

1085
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
the story,

1086
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
you also published readings.

1087
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
I think that was the best episode,

1088
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
it had about 4,100 listeners

1089
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
on the podcast system,

1090
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
plus probably even more,

1091
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
because they are only from one platform.

1092
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
But that's a very nice

1093
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
reading in this market

1094
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
for such a podcast.

1095
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Congratulations on that.

1096
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,119
Thank you, anyway.

1097
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,119
You were on the list of the best podcasts.

1098
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,119
Did you ever

1099
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,119
fall into

1100
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,119
releasing and then

1101
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,119
watching those readings?

1102
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,119
Because the rest of the work,

1103
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,119
we'll talk about it later,

1104
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,119
those metrics, analytics,

1105
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,119
statistics,

1106
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,119
it seems to me that in the first few hours

1107
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,119
you can already see if something is wrong,

1108
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,119
if it's flying, if it's not going to fly.

1109
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,519
I just said I won't watch it,

1110
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,519
it doesn't matter.

1111
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,519
Input-output metrics.

1112
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,519
That's a very important thing for me,

1113
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,519
also on LinkedIn, when we talk,

1114
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,519
and I get a lot of comments

1115
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,519
on private messages,

1116
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,519
why is this post so good,

1117
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,519
why does it only have 200 hits,

1118
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,519
and what other problems.

1119
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,519
I always remember their business model.

1120
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,519
And I have an ironic story

1121
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,519
about how you earn 10 euros a month.

1122
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,519
Are you interested?

1123
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
You have two pages when they pay you,

1124
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
and 5 euros, you have 100 pages

1125
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
when they pay you, 100 euros.

1126
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
So now the question is,

1127
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
where do you want to play the game?

1128
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Do you want to have a low price,

1129
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
and then full volume,

1130
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
and you will go to the same figure,

1131
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
or will you worry that your message

1132
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
will come from two of those people

1133
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
who need to be heard?

1134
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
When we do demand generation,

1135
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
that's what I call generating questions,

1136
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
we all move forward

1137
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
in the general phase,

1138
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
before someone contacts us

1139
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
and needs something.

1140
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
We somehow imagine it,

1141
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
or form it,

1142
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
I won't say program it,

1143
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
so that our message is delivered.

1144
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
And here,

1145
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
the key question

1146
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
is one of the first principles,

1147
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
where do you want to play the game?

1148
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Because if you want

1149
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
to get two new pages,

1150
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
you don't have to do LinkedIn posts every day

1151
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
and post on Twitter,

1152
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
you don't have to.

1153
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
You have to go to an event,

1154
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
to meet a shopper,

1155
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
or a company manager,

1156
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
tell them that you are a programmer,

1157
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
and then tell them that

1158
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
you would like to have a meeting with them.

1159
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
I analyze it a bit more,

1160
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
but that's how business works.

1161
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Or you are a friend with a friend,

1162
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
or with me,

1163
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
or with Jure Čuhalov,

1164
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
and you show that you know how to work.

1165
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,119
People ask us,

1166
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,119
do you know who this Slovenian player

1167
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,119
is in love with?

1168
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,119
I think that if you are in the vicinity of the epicenter,

1169
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,119
you will get a lot of business out of it.

1170
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,119
What I want to tell you with that,

1171
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,119
yes, you come late,

1172
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,119
you update if there are comments,

1173
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,119
but then you snap your fingers

1174
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,119
and say, no, Maja Šit,

1175
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,119
these are one of those metrics.

1176
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,119
These are metrics that in your business

1177
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,119
have no final result.

1178
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,119
Yes, everything sounds great on paper,

1179
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,119
but in a real episode,

1180
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,119
an influencer with 30k followers

1181
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,119
would cry.

1182
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,119
Do I want to do that?

1183
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,119
Do I really want to do that?

1184
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,119
Is that the intelligence of the people

1185
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:41,119
and intellectual talent

1186
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,119
that I can reach?

1187
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,119
Sorry, but if we go to a reality show?

1188
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,119
Yes.

1189
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,119
Would you go?

1190
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,119
Reality show.

1191
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,119
Where would you go?

1192
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:55,119
To watch a reality show.

1193
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:57,119
I can't watch a reality show.

1194
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,119
How about you? You are more data-driven,

1195
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,119
you work a lot for analytics.

1196
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,119
How do you feel about it?

1197
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,119
Actually,

1198
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,119
I realized that

1199
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,119
it is easier

1200
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,119
to communicate with the team

1201
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,119
if you say

1202
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,119
this episode has

1203
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,119
such a volume

1204
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,119
versus that one.

1205
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:21,119
That's much better and in a way

1206
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,119
I can see the connection.

1207
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,119
If you get to the point

1208
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,119
when you say we need

1209
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,119
new microphones,

1210
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,119
we need a new supporter,

1211
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,119
it is easier if you have some

1212
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,119
devices to operate with

1213
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,119
as much as you can.

1214
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,119
Also to see

1215
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,119
if the product is growing or not,

1216
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,119
if it is stagnating,

1217
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,119
that is also important.

1218
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,119
So, yes,

1219
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,119
as I said before,

1220
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,119
you start watching those devices

1221
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,119
and you can also

1222
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,119
have some

1223
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,119
more

1224
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,119
different topics.

1225
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,119
How can a programmer earn

1226
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,119
10k a month?

1227
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,119
You go to a Slovenian developer

1228
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,119
and you have 5k views.

1229
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,119
Well, no.

1230
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,119
Because it is not your value.

1231
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,119
We made

1232
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,119
an episode

1233
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,119
in Grodno, which I called

1234
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,119
Tagon.

1235
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,119
They are for juniors,

1236
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,119
for beginners,

1237
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,119
not only for young people,

1238
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,119
but for anyone who wants to learn

1239
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,119
to program, because we saw

1240
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,119
that there is a lot of potential

1241
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,119
for growth in this segment,

1242
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,119
that there are a lot of questions

1243
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,119
about themselves,

1244
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
because for young people

1245
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,119
local topics are not so much,

1246
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,119
and there is a lot of opportunity.

1247
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,119
It is true, as my colleague

1248
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,119
said, the title we gave

1249
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,119
is Money Printing Title, and maybe

1250
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,119
that's why people think

1251
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,119
that becoming a programmer is

1252
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,119
a money printing career.

1253
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,119
Not far from it, but people

1254
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,119
have it many times.

1255
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,119
So, our episodes,

1256
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,119
for example,

1257
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,119
we made them for beginners,

1258
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
they are much better than others,

1259
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,119
and I think it is also true

1260
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
that we made them not only for

1261
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,119
everyone, but also for

1262
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,119
our community.

1263
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,119
What do you mean?

1264
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,119
You know, as you said,

1265
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,119
when I started thinking about

1266
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,119
how you motivate your team,

1267
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,119
I mean, here at GTM Strategist

1268
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,119
I have eight people who work

1269
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,119
from three different countries,

1270
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,119
and my first thing I do on Saturday

1271
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,119
is to see how many emails

1272
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,119
we have on the waitlist,

1273
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,119
to see how much has been reached on LinkedIn,

1274
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,119
and where new supporters

1275
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,119
have supported us internationally.

1276
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,119
And that's great,

1277
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
because when you need to motivate your team,

1278
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,119
you have to be a role model.

1279
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,119
Again,

1280
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,119
I'm a leadership douchebag.

1281
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,119
I'm like, let's go,

1282
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
mission critical, ninja, let's go.

1283
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,119
I hear you're a general.

1284
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
Yes,

1285
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,119
that's what they called me.

1286
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,119
But what is very important to me,

1287
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,119
psychological safety is very important

1288
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,119
for this new generation,

1289
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,119
and I can work from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m.,

1290
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,119
but I'm afraid

1291
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,119
I won't be able to do it

1292
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,119
if it's not my company.

1293
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,119
So you can still

1294
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,119
put a lot of pressure on yourself.

1295
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,119
But what you said,

1296
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,119
that you have a feedback loop,

1297
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,119
that you can improve,

1298
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,119
I think the only difference

1299
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,119
in the way you talk,

1300
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,119
is that in my podcast

1301
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,119
I never really talk.

1302
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
That was my side project,

1303
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,119
I've been doing it for two hours.

1304
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,119
You put a lot of pressure

1305
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,119
on your mindset,

1306
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,119
and then you don't have it.

1307
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,119
You don't have it?

1308
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,119
Yes.

1309
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,119
The goal was to get to know

1310
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,119
a lot of people,

1311
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,119
share knowledge,

1312
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,119
and ask questions,

1313
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
which was very challenging for me.

1314
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,119
And it somehow happened.

1315
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,119
When I saw your strategy,

1316
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,119
I was like,

1317
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,119
Maja, you from business school,

1318
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,119
but it was very, very, very

1319
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,119
strategically planned.

1320
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,119
It was also interesting

1321
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,119
when Matej showed me your Discord.

1322
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,119
I've never been to your Discord,

1323
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,119
but then I saw

1324
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,119
the comments,

1325
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,119
it's a very powerful community.

1326
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,119
It's a great way

1327
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,119
to engage with people.

1328
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,119
And I don't think people in Facebook groups

1329
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,119
will ever achieve that.

1330
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,119
So if you want to make people younger,

1331
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,119
you have to shift the platform.

1332
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,119
We're at 40 minutes now.

1333
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,119
No, no, you're drinking red wine.

1334
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,119
I'm drinking red wine.

1335
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,119
Antioxidants.

1336
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,119
Maybe later

1337
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,119
we'll...

1338
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,119
Again, promise to come to the book.

1339
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,119
We have to come to the book.

1340
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,119
We have to come to the book.

1341
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
We have to come to the book,

1342
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,119
because it's up to date for your listeners.

1343
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,119
I think everyone gets value

1344
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,119
because

1345
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,119
we have supporters

1346
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,119
who,

1347
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,119
in your podcast,

1348
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,119
you haven't done before,

1349
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,119
but we made a Patreon.

1350
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,119
That's something

1351
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,119
we have.

1352
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,119
Patreon is,

1353
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,119
I have to say what it is,

1354
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,119
because I wanted someone to say it.

1355
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,119
I understand, because Žarjala has been

1356
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,119
doing it for a long time.

1357
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,119
I chose it

1358
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,119
because

1359
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,119
maybe it's too much

1360
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,119
and I don't know why.

1361
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,119
We're not that big to make it significant.

1362
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,119
But Patreon

1363
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,119
is a platform where

1364
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,119
you can

1365
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,119
choose a monthly

1366
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,119
donation

1367
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,119
with the creator

1368
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,119
and in exchange

1369
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,119
for that donation

1370
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,119
you get premium access,

1371
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,119
merch, colors,

1372
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,119
pictures, whatever.

1373
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,119
Mentoring with Otto.

1374
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,119
That's not what we're doing.

1375
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
BB, BB, BB.

1376
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,119
BB, BB, BB.

1377
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,119
No, but we divided,

1378
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,119
we made four

1379
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,119
packages.

1380
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,119
The smallest, I think, is

1381
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,119
3 euros per month.

1382
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,119
The most expensive, I think, is 40.

1383
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,119
And we have some supporters

1384
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,119
who help

1385
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,119
to finance an episode.

1386
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,119
For example,

1387
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,119
the episode we're doing now

1388
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,119
will get pictures,

1389
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
a week later they'll see the episode,

1390
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,119
listen to it, write it down.

1391
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,119
We tried to make a clip

1392
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,119
of ourselves with them,

1393
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,119
so we knew what our strategy

1394
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,119
would be,

1395
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,119
and how to lie to them.

1396
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,119
I was very happy and

1397
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,119
it wasn't intuitive

1398
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,119
to do it,

1399
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,119
but it turned out

1400
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,119
to be very welcome.

1401
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,119
They helped us a lot.

1402
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,119
Thank you to all Patreons for that.

1403
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,119
You probably financed it all by yourself.

1404
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,119
What is it?

1405
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,119
Look, Otto, again, it's like a dream for me.

1406
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,119
No, no,

1407
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,119
you think I have a strategy

1408
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,119
and a plan,

1409
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,119
but I'm doing something

1410
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,119
that I'm interested in doing.

1411
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,119
In my opinion,

1412
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,119
the funniest thing

1413
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,119
when I go to a club,

1414
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,119
in 90% of cases,

1415
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,119
they write back,

1416
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,119
what a great energy!

1417
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,119
And I'm like, what the fuck is energy?

1418
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,119
What does that mean?

1419
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,119
I put some crystals on it.

1420
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
Do not cringe me,

1421
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,119
I'm not a joker, okay?

1422
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,119
Then I realized that energy

1423
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,119
means a passion for business.

1424
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,119
Maybe because I feel

1425
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,119
certain things,

1426
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,119
but I'm also excited

1427
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,119
to do business.

1428
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,119
And you know,

1429
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,119
it's all a game to me.

1430
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,119
I'm like, can I sell today

1431
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,119
for three hours of tea?

1432
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,119
Can I get 500 supporters?

1433
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,119
Can I do that?

1434
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,119
That's why I'm so funny.

1435
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,119
Because I'm such a positive person

1436
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,119
that I go and get involved

1437
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,119
in this goal and find a way

1438
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,119
to do it.

1439
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,119
And I did it.

1440
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,119
There were a few more sports,

1441
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,119
but those people who are

1442
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
interested in the military

1443
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,119
or some other disciplines,

1444
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,119
it really, really, really attracts.

1445
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,119
Why? Because I think

1446
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,119
that we are like a society,

1447
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,119
we have already fallen into such a melancholy

1448
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,119
that nothing is possible.

1449
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,119
In my opinion, everything is possible.

1450
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,119
I would like to work with your friend.

1451
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,119
Come, I'm sitting here on the podcast.

1452
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,119
Would you be nice

1453
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,119
if I fucked first?

1454
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,119
I'm the newest person in the world

1455
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,119
and I wrote to you 14 times

1456
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,119
before you wrote to me.

1457
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,119
No, I would just say that

1458
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,119
you didn't just write to me,

1459
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,119
you also sent me a nice message.

1460
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,119
I sent a voice message.

1461
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,119
I must admit that my fans

1462
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,119
were contemplating

1463
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,119
why I would get such a nice message.

1464
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,119
And then, you know,

1465
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,119
I'm just saying,

1466
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,119
it's marketing today.

1467
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,119
No, I just wanted your respect.

1468
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,119
No, I respect you,

1469
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,119
from the posts you have,

1470
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,119
you do it well,

1471
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,119
and I just wanted one-on-one

1472
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,119
over you.

1473
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,119
So this game is not

1474
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,119
an endgame.

1475
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,119
I am very honored to sit here,

1476
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,119
to talk, but I am again

1477
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,119
very, very, very, very, very

1478
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,119
honored in life.

1479
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,119
I think it is important for us

1480
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,119
to build a relationship.

1481
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,119
Let's get out of this

1482
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,119
Oh yeah.

1483
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,119
Communities.

1484
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,119
I will now...

1485
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,119
Fuck, I'm doing this intro now.

1486
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,119
In Grodje, we somehow

1487
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,119
came up with

1488
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,119
two components.

1489
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,119
One is the community,

1490
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,119
the other is the media

1491
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,119
that gives content.

1492
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,119
And also the Discord,

1493
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,119
which you mentioned before,

1494
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,119
is part of it.

1495
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,119
I somehow invite people

1496
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,119
to come to Grodje,

1497
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,119
to join the Discord,

1498
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,119
to get some hints

1499
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,119
on what the next topics will be,

1500
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,119
to give us feedback,

1501
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,119
to be in contact

1502
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,119
with us,

1503
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,119
so that you don't lie

1504
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,119
to yourself,

1505
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,119
you know, for whom you lie,

1506
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,119
or how you lie to the person,

1507
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,119
or how you lie to the audience.

1508
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,119
Let me tell you a public secret.

1509
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,119
What kind of business do you do together?

1510
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,119
Are you talking about rap?

1511
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,119
What kind of business do you have?

1512
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,119
Oh, how can I answer that now?

1513
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,119
Has it already happened, or not?

1514
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,119
I mean,

1515
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,119
I don't have to now,

1516
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,119
because they're not here,

1517
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,119
but yeah, I mean,

1518
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,119
almost everyone got it because of that job,

1519
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,119
absolutely.

1520
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,119
It has nothing to do with the relationship, right?

1521
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,119
Yeah, and also because

1522
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,119
directly in the team,

1523
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,119
or later, absolutely, yeah.

1524
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,119
Well, at the end of the day,

1525
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,119
people are doing business,

1526
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,119
people are doing business with people,

1527
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,119
and since a powerful community

1528
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,119
exists,

1529
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,119
I mean, the relationships are

1530
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,119
more powerful,

1531
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,119
more connected, it's easier to work, right?

1532
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,119
So I think that

1533
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,119
maybe only the listeners

1534
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,119
don't engage with that community,

1535
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,119
don't pay attention to it, but absolutely

1536
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,119
there is a very powerful community.

1537
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,119
Also last summer,

1538
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,119
for example, we also went

1539
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,119
to help out

1540
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,119
at

1541
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,119
meetups, for example,

1542
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,119
and at some conferences,

1543
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,119
because

1544
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,119
either we were already selling there,

1545
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,119
or people are now paying attention

1546
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,119
to having a really good meetup,

1547
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,119
and they don't have that

1548
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,119
marketing machinery, I guess.

1549
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,119
And then we invited people,

1550
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,119
and now we tried a few times

1551
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,119
to say, okay, this is that conference,

1552
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,119
we'll be there,

1553
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,119
we'll be a community sponsor,

1554
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,119
we'll invite some people,

1555
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,119
and you'll give us, I don't know, a guest speech,

1556
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,119
and then we're all happy, right?

1557
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,119
So that also works, for example.

1558
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,119
But if I go back to the community,

1559
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,119
now, we have our own community,

1560
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,119
it's still small, it's growing,

1561
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,119
but... How many channels do you have?

1562
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,119
On Discord it's around 300 people.

1563
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,119
But that's not a small community,

1564
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,119
I'm not a small community,

1565
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,119
I'm my own Facebook chat.

1566
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,119
No, but the other community

1567
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,119
that we both hold,

1568
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,119
Growth Hacking Slovenia,

1569
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,119
has around 9000 people.

1570
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,119
Or 13, right?

1571
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,119
Slovenian is around 15.

1572
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,119
Oh, you're fast.

1573
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,119
But, I have to admit,

1574
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,119
that

1575
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,119
what you mentioned before,

1576
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,119
among the groups,

1577
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,119
I notice that the platforms

1578
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,119
for those communities

1579
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,119
are also quite unique.

1580
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,119
No shit.

1581
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,119
If you go to Facebook at night,

1582
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,119
they have more Facebook, right?

1583
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,119
And now, if we say 10,000,

1584
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,119
or 15,000,

1585
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,119
or whatever those numbers are on Facebook,

1586
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,119
now people think, oh, shit,

1587
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,119
there are 15,000 people,

1588
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,119
I'll post for a job, or for an event,

1589
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,119
10,000 people will see,

1590
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,119
that's great.

1591
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,119
If I write a copy and a picture,

1592
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,119
God forbid I post a video,

1593
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,119
it'll be even worse.

1594
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,119
And culture, too.

1595
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,119
Thank you for mentioning it,

1596
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,119
because I also have a

1597
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,119
freelance group,

1598
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,119
Growth Hacking Slovenia,

1599
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,119
because there's more intimacy.

1600
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,119
You have to be careful,

1601
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,119
what you post,

1602
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,119
but we have to stick to the rules,

1603
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,119
because otherwise, the energy is lost,

1604
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,119
and it turns into a mess.

1605
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,119
And thank you, too,

1606
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,119
when you post something,

1607
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,119
and spoil our admin job,

1608
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,119
I hope we thank you enough for that.

1609
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,119
No, because once and for all,

1610
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,119
it's like in passive training.

1611
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,119
Okay, I have a dog, you have children,

1612
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,119
so you can comment from a different perspective.

1613
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,119
I was in a passive group.

1614
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,119
Once and for all,

1615
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,119
they're looking for me,

1616
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,119
and if you let one down,

1617
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,119
then you don't have any more precedent

1618
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,119
that you're used to it.

1619
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,119
And sorry, I'm sorry,

1620
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,119
I didn't have much interest

1621
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,119
to read something,

1622
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,119
but I was in a group of people

1623
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,119
who are profitable,

1624
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,119
and would sell it for 4 euros.

1625
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,119
I think that's not something

1626
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,119
I would like to do in my free time.

1627
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,119
Speaking of those intimate communities,

1628
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,119
I would like to ask you

1629
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,119
what do you think is the key

1630
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,119
to a successful group?

1631
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,119
I think you need,

1632
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,119
in an organization,

1633
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,119
maybe someone

1634
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,119
who is a little more

1635
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,119
experienced,

1636
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,119
a little more visible,

1637
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,119
and a little more clear,

1638
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,119
I don't know,

1639
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,119
to push some new content,

1640
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,119
to generate content,

1641
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,119
to make content,

1642
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,119
but is more visible.

1643
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,119
Then I think

1644
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,119
you also need someone

1645
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,119
who will want content

1646
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,119
that is not in line

1647
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,119
with those rules.

1648
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,119
And you need both.

1649
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,119
You also need people

1650
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,119
who...

1651
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,119
Now,

1652
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,119
people in the flesh,

1653
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,119
and I think you need

1654
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,119
to be fully consistent

1655
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,119
with those rules.

1656
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,119
Once you see it,

1657
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,119
without missing a beat.

1658
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,119
If I go to Slovenian developers,

1659
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,119
there was a big push,

1660
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,119
let's change this rule,

1661
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,119
let's add that rule,

1662
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,119
let's add the third rule,

1663
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,119
and it seems to me that

1664
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,119
I don't know how we will enforce

1665
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,119
that rule, but you,

1666
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,119
Miha Medven...

1667
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,119
Miha, we like you.

1668
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,119
He took

1669
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,119
some more time

1670
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,119
to clean it up.

1671
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,119
But now,

1672
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,119
I think that

1673
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,119
this community exists for some time,

1674
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,119
people have children,

1675
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,119
I didn't have a couple of admins

1676
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,119
with Slovenian developers

1677
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,119
who let me use Facebook,

1678
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,119
so the generation is changing.

1679
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,119
I don't know,

1680
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,119
you need a mix.

1681
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,119
Now,

1682
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,119
I personally,

1683
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,119
the only reason I still have Facebook

1684
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,119
is this group.

1685
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,119
What do you think?

1686
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,119
A couple of years ago,

1687
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,119
I was faced with this question.

1688
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,119
Do I delete Facebook,

1689
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,119
and that's it?

1690
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,119
Or should I try

1691
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,119
to push the Slovenian development

1692
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,119
forward a little bit,

1693
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,119
and maybe do something more?

1694
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,119
And then we had

1695
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,119
this, now it's a different time,

1696
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,119
this show that you know,

1697
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,119
and we let people

1698
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,119
show it.

1699
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,760
what they are doing, and some interesting things happened there.

1700
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:14,000
Miha is also full of those post-matches where you call people to ask stupid questions.

1701
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Watch me.

1702
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah, right.

1703
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So...

1704
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Those are some kind of experiments, but...

1705
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't know, it seems to me that...

1706
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Artful engagement, yeah.

1707
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I think everyone engages, and they are there.

1708
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's still the biggest tech community on the web in Slovenia,

1709
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and it pays off to be a good citizen.

1710
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I also think that if you are a fool in there,

1711
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:51,000
your boss, your partner, your professor, your teacher, whatever, your colleague,

1712
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and people are often not aware of that, but still,

1713
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
it's such a big community that not everyone can see it.

1714
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So it pays off to take it all in.

1715
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I know it's toxic sometimes, and I have my problems.

1716
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I once had an anxiety attack when I logged in, yeah.

1717
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I know it can be very unpleasant,

1718
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
but I still think you have to admit that...

1719
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I think a lot of people today are consumers of those media

1720
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
without total engagement.

1721
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They just watch it, and they won't press like, comment, nothing.

1722
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And that's it.

1723
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I think that's also happening.

1724
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So people will see it, but they don't have to know.

1725
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
No, I'm so glad you're talking about it,

1726
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
because I have a hypothesis that every community

1727
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
goes through three different phases, development phases.

1728
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
The first phase is you, and then your uphill battle.

1729
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Like you're climbing a mountain,

1730
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and then you ask your friends if they want to engage with you,

1731
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
and then you get to the top, and that's it.

1732
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And when you get to that critical mass,

1733
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
people get together and start to develop that feeling of intimacy.

1734
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
For example, if you're going to talk, you talk in a different way

1735
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
than if you're going to talk in big groups.

1736
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Because you have to play different social games,

1737
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
play different characters.

1738
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And here it's really interesting to me,

1739
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
what is the scale at which you break?

1740
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
When you look at it evolutionarily,

1741
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
how long have you known each other?

1742
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
If you look back, you met, I don't know, you and a neighbor of yours,

1743
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and maybe you met 100 or 200 people.

1744
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That's how our brains developed.

1745
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And now, suddenly, it's a message,

1746
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
when you broadcast it to 10,000 people,

1747
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
that you can, I don't know,

1748
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
under the profile picture of a dog,

1749
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
write back that you're a fool,

1750
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and that you're lying anyway,

1751
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and that, I don't know, this political party is the law.

1752
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So there's a lot of pressure,

1753
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
for which our brains,

1754
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
which have evolved evolutionarily,

1755
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
adapt to the tribe,

1756
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
they're not used to such large tribes.

1757
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And you can't engage those 10,000 people,

1758
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
but at some point, you just want to run,

1759
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and you can be a secret with the rule.

1760
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And then the question is,

1761
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
can we do it, or why are we doing it?

1762
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Why are we doing it?

1763
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I think my answer is,

1764
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
because we still have a platform,

1765
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
like you said, for job posts,

1766
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
for young people to make careers,

1767
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and fuck good media,

1768
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and for trusting good media.

1769
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And now, do we think we're some kind of brokers of trust?

1770
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Fuck no.

1771
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But everyone knows that this information

1772
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
that they receive,

1773
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
that everyone is semi-relevant,

1774
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
they're attacked in the comments.

1775
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So the communities are self-sanctioned.

1776
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And here, I think, there's a big difference

1777
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
between large and small communities,

1778
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
because everyone has their own

1779
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
different forms,

1780
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
from masterminds,

1781
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
to mentors,

1782
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
to mega-groups,

1783
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
which I feel like they're being watched.

1784
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, it's not nice.

1785
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's not nice?

1786
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
No, it's very...

1787
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Even if you go back,

1788
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
if I go back to

1789
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Facebook,

1790
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I think that as a platform

1791
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
they've also come to a phase

1792
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
where they're confused.

1793
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Late majority, late majority,

1794
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
babi!

1795
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I see that they're also a bit confused

1796
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
that groups are actually

1797
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
one of those...

1798
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I don't know, maybe I'm biased,

1799
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
but I have a feeling that

1800
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Facebook is still

1801
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
the last remaining useful feature

1802
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
for me.

1803
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I'm probably biased

1804
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
about that channel.

1805
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Now, when we

1806
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
publish our content,

1807
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
we put it on YouTube,

1808
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and then we link it

1809
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
to Slovenian developers,

1810
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and we also have a page

1811
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
in Grodno on Facebook,

1812
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
where we also publish it normally.

1813
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But...

1814
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I think I fully realized

1815
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
that our page

1816
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
is a

1817
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
slot machine.

1818
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Now, I'll put in

1819
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
a certain amount of cash,

1820
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
then I'll put in that...

1821
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Once I know that we've put

1822
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
a crazy amount of money in,

1823
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
10-20 euros,

1824
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
it's quite something.

1825
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
5000 in total, bravo!

1826
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Marinka Wittler, great!

1827
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But there was a problem.

1828
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Who am I talking to?

1829
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It's quite something.

1830
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And then...

1831
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Now we have some people

1832
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
on Facebook, we give them

1833
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
personal information, if people are

1834
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
really passionate about Facebook,

1835
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
they get everything there, but...

1836
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I don't know, I don't see it as a channel

1837
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
of the future.

1838
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You said slot machine,

1839
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I call it a pay-to-play algorithm.

1840
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I've seen that a lot on LinkedIn,

1841
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and I've measured it.

1842
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
For example, if you publish something

1843
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
on LinkedIn as a page,

1844
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
you get everything, if you go from a few

1845
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
personal profiles. And that's why through

1846
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
companies, we're working on

1847
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
employee-generated content,

1848
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
and I recently had a friend

1849
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
from ActiveCampaign,

1850
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and we had a conversation, how can smart

1851
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
people, like engineers and developers,

1852
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
be inspired to participate

1853
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
in employee-generated content

1854
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
programs? Marketing will

1855
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
participate, not panic. Sales will

1856
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
participate.

1857
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
These are less-remaining,

1858
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I don't know.

1859
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
No, no, no. You know what I want to say?

1860
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I mean, what is the logic,

1861
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
purely algorithmic logic,

1862
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
if a company wants to sell you

1863
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
their advertising solutions,

1864
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
recruiting solutions, whatnot,

1865
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
if you're a slogan on the platform,

1866
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and they sell your eyes,

1867
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and they have a subtle interest to keep you up.

1868
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And how we work with companies

1869
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
like that, purely for their

1870
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
commercial activity,

1871
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
to hire 5-10 employees,

1872
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
to post, to share,

1873
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
from the perspective of reach,

1874
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
from the perspective of engagement,

1875
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
just be it.

1876
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And those changes that happen,

1877
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
by force, do certain things

1878
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
that maybe,

1879
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I don't know if they were evolutionarily

1880
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
OK, because, sorry,

1881
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
that you attack your engineer, your developer,

1882
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
your CTO,

1883
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
that he writes cringe posts,

1884
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
how he was a god in the 14th century,

1885
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and how he didn't believe that God

1886
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
could program, and now he leads a team

1887
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
of 20 people, because

1888
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
the company will have a business like,

1889
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
sorry, this is not the best use of your time.

1890
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And now I don't know,

1891
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
purely from the perspective of channels,

1892
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
it all looks like they're strong channels,

1893
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
but every channel you work on

1894
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
has opportunity costs.

1895
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Every thing, and you know how you do it,

1896
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
for example, if you're doing a service,

1897
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
and the agency, we, for example,

1898
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
together with a colleague on a project,

1899
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
in August, we made 12 million

1900
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
for a Slovenian company.

1901
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And we did it through outreach,

1902
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
because it's totally cringe

1903
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
to send personalized messages to people,

1904
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
saying, hey, maybe you're interested in this and that,

1905
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
but in an unintelligent way.

1906
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It wasn't very researched.

1907
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And here, you know,

1908
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I would say to people,

1909
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
come and get involved for 6 months,

1910
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and post on LinkedIn every day,

1911
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and Instagram stories.

1912
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I've already seen your reaction.

1913
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
One of those classic,

1914
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
one of those classic...

1915
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You're a very dynamic speaker.

1916
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Sorry, sorry,

1917
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
this is like...

1918
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
No, no, it's a bit old-fashioned,

1919
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
it's a bit of a Jeremy approach,

1920
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
you have to hold yourself up.

1921
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm going to sleep now,

1922
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
God forbid.

1923
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
No, come on, what did you want to ask before?

1924
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That you're fully triggered

1925
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
when people say you have to post

1926
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
every day on LinkedIn.

1927
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And your pictures of your kids,

1928
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and your cats, and...

1929
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Privacy invasion.

1930
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
OK, and what about our coffee machine,

1931
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
our coffee machine,

1932
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
our, I don't know, engine?

1933
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
OK, look,

1934
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
my filter for content is

1935
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
does the world become more intelligent with it?

1936
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And if the answer is no...

1937
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
That's it.

1938
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Look, I'm also a humorist,

1939
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I have a bit of added value,

1940
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm a fan of memes

1941
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and all that stuff.

1942
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I just said that again,

1943
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
how much a politician...

1944
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Actually, today...

1945
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Is it an added value?

1946
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Did I tell you something you don't know yet?

1947
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Did I pray to you so nicely?

1948
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Only, Maja, if I sell, I don't know,

1949
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
tires, and I don't know,

1950
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I can generate some money

1951
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
every week.

1952
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yes.

1953
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yes?

1954
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yes.

1955
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
OK.

1956
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
OK.

1957
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
OK.

1958
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Yes.

1959
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yes.

1960
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yes.

1961
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yes.

1962
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yes.

1963
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yes.

1964
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Yes.

1965
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yes.

1966
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:50,239
Yes.

1967
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
How do you find a genuine brand?

1968
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You feel it.

1969
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I think we are people by now.

1970
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Is it something that the boss sets,

1971
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
or is it something that you go to the factory to ask,

1972
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
or is it something that people tell you?

1973
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Pay-to-Marketer.

1974
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I always had the feeling that

1975
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
there is so much content,

1976
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so much noise,

1977
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
so much noise,

1978
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
that we will eventually come to a point

1979
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
where you really have to be authentic,

1980
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
and people will also find out,

1981
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
okay, this is fake,

1982
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
this is not fake.

1983
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Ben Williams said that,

1984
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I know, even when we talked,

1985
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
and a critical thinker, right?

1986
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Because if you say to your corporate chair,

1987
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
you know, say hello to your team,

1988
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
welcome new employees

1989
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
from the programming field,

1990
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
so, come on.

1991
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You write, these are technological challenges

1992
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that we are solving,

1993
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
this is how we function,

1994
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
we are trying not to do more than

1995
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
30 hours a week for it,

1996
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and that's it, take it or leave it.

1997
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And I think transparency here,

1998
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
you know, to take this layer of fluff,

1999
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
you can't always do it.

2000
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You have worked with corporate,

2001
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I have worked with corporate,

2002
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
you know what compliance is,

2003
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
you know what it is,

2004
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
you have to hire 6 employees

2005
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
to be super transparent,

2006
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
because sometimes you mess up a bit.

2007
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
But in smaller teams,

2008
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
and if you work as a personal brand,

2009
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
sorry, the way we talk,

2010
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I sometimes check it,

2011
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
is it the language I would say to you?

2012
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Would it be like,

2013
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
respected, today I am honored

2014
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
that I talked to the gentleman

2015
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
on the podcast in Grodno.

2016
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And it seems to me that

2017
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
the bullshit filter is definitely here,

2018
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
but I really believe,

2019
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
that content must always be done

2020
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
with a certain degree of attention

2021
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
to quality, because I don't know,

2022
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
if you paint your half-painted cow

2023
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and your dog watching you every day,

2024
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
you are still like,

2025
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
my life is a little better

2026
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
because I saw that picture or not.

2027
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Well, I don't know,

2028
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
we all have different interests

2029
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
why we make content,

2030
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I don't, because it takes me a long time

2031
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
to learn something.

2032
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
An interesting case I saw recently,

2033
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
also from the page

2034
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
that you mentioned

2035
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
about your products,

2036
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
an interesting case happened to me,

2037
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
some company,

2038
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
we talked that maybe

2039
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I would shoot something with them,

2040
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
and

2041
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
they didn't see

2042
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
that they are exceptional,

2043
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
but

2044
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
from our perspective

2045
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
they were, I don't know,

2046
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
data center,

2047
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
full amazing,

2048
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
some servers, clusters, whatever,

2049
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and we as a page

2050
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
pay attention

2051
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
to that uniqueness,

2052
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
that passion,

2053
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
that's an interesting thing.

2054
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You probably have to include

2055
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
your page in that.

2056
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That's the law. And the agency,

2057
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and the foreign expert,

2058
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
because it's normal for you,

2059
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and when you are in your discipline,

2060
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
in your science,

2061
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
you don't see more important things,

2062
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
that some fresh eyes see.

2063
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
How do you do that?

2064
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I don't know, if you are doing

2065
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
custom research,

2066
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
you say, today we have open doors

2067
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
in the company, and then you see

2068
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
what people like.

2069
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Let me tell you,

2070
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I did custom research for my book.

2071
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Amazing, amazing.

2072
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I will add that too.

2073
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That's great.

2074
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That's Diablo, right?

2075
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Diablo, yes.

2076
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Although I had lessons from Primorska,

2077
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
but I said no,

2078
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
we will drink Cabernet Sauvignon.

2079
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Cabernet Sauvignon is the only

2080
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
good wine in our guest.

2081
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Everything is like that.

2082
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
If you order Cabernet Sauvignon in a restaurant,

2083
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
you can't get a bad one.

2084
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Don't make fun of me.

2085
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
No, no, no.

2086
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
If we go to another round,

2087
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
we will come back to that.

2088
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
As I told you,

2089
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
at the beginning of this conversation,

2090
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I was half life and half fear.

2091
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
What would the programmers think of me?

2092
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You are so exposed to the programmers.

2093
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I mean, I try.

2094
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I would like to be even more,

2095
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
but they don't accept me.

2096
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Why?

2097
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Because I come and talk.

2098
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
A few days ago, I started recording

2099
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
in Hotline Hany Music,

2100
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
where we talked on a cell phone.

2101
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I said, guys, what are you doing?

2102
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I am Maja Voje.

2103
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I am also interested in computers.

2104
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
How did you react to that?

2105
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Freeze.

2106
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't know what to do.

2107
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I am a little overwhelmed.

2108
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I try to be nice.

2109
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Some people treat me

2110
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
better than others.

2111
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I am really interested in these things.

2112
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I go crazy about these things.

2113
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
But later in the research,

2114
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I was afraid if this book

2115
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
is good for a product manager,

2116
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
for a developer, for a technical founder.

2117
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Because, sorry,

2118
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
someone from marketing

2119
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
or from a group of people

2120
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I will say,

2121
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
it was easy for me

2122
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
after I did a session with

2123
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
70,000 people on Udemy

2124
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and I have been in this conversation

2125
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
for so many years.

2126
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But I know this.

2127
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
In a simple way,

2128
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
to present it to people

2129
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
who will use it a lot,

2130
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and at the beginning

2131
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
the most difficult thing

2132
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
was product pricing.

2133
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Because I didn't know much about it.

2134
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Product was really strange to me.

2135
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And then I had a product manager

2136
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
from Google who helped me

2137
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
to structure it.

2138
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
But what I told you here

2139
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
is that I asked a lot for help.

2140
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I don't have anything to say.

2141
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
If I don't know something,

2142
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I don't understand something,

2143
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I ask for feedback.

2144
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And you also participated

2145
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
in the first round of feedback.

2146
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I recorded a weird video

2147
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and I wrote a book about it.

2148
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
This is my head.

2149
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
But I sent it very intentionally

2150
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
on 50 pages

2151
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
on different profiles

2152
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
and I saw exactly

2153
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
where the positive feedback

2154
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and where the negative feedback came from.

2155
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And then I mapped those feedbacks.

2156
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
The green ones,

2157
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
the ones that were OK.

2158
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The ones that were like

2159
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I don't give up.

2160
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's cool, it's over.

2161
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And the ones that were

2162
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
really good, but not clear.

2163
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And then there were feedbacks

2164
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
that didn't go through at all.

2165
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I don't want to say it's anti-persona,

2166
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
but there were people who said

2167
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I don't have to climb

2168
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
because I'm not fucking Nutella

2169
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and I don't have to satisfy myself.

2170
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Damn, you took that from the text.

2171
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
One of my favorite.

2172
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
What came out of the first round

2173
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
of this research is that

2174
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I work very well with product managers,

2175
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I work very well with technical founders,

2176
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and with people who

2177
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
understand sales

2178
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and marketing more than just

2179
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
which channel we will choose

2180
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
to get customers.

2181
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Because they understand the pricing.

2182
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
For example, if you sell to different segments

2183
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
of customers, you will also achieve

2184
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
a higher price.

2185
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
If you sell to May VM,

2186
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
if you sell to marketers,

2187
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
you will be able to sell to Juri.

2188
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
That's what I think.

2189
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
But we have a slightly different

2190
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
readiness to pay.

2191
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But what I really wanted to tell you

2192
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
is that through this research

2193
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I got a very clear idea

2194
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
of who I was talking to.

2195
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And that opened my eyes

2196
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
because then I knew

2197
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
which examples I had to include in the book.

2198
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I was very interviewed in the process.

2199
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I put Amplitude in the book,

2200
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I put Figma in the book,

2201
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I put MongoDB in the book,

2202
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
you don't have to translate it.

2203
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You explained it to me.

2204
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I put Snyk in the book.

2205
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
No.

2206
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Shit, I don't know.

2207
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm making a lot of mistakes.

2208
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You showed me that video,

2209
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I watched it because I was interested

2210
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
in what it was about.

2211
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I can relate to a lot of products,

2212
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
the stories

2213
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
with which I worked,

2214
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
but why

2215
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
does this part

2216
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
seem so important to me?

2217
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Why did I sit here

2218
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
for half a day?

2219
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
For example,

2220
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
you have to ask a person

2221
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
to come,

2222
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
you have to ask

2223
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
a person to come,

2224
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
then you have to ask

2225
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Jano to come,

2226
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
then you have to ask

2227
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
someone to help technically.

2228
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You have to do everything,

2229
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
then you have to talk to her.

2230
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
No problems at all.

2231
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
That's the funniest part.

2232
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Then you wait for the product

2233
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
to be made, for Jano to do it,

2234
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
and then it's done.

2235
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
MP4, whatever, it's done,

2236
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Jano delivers it to you.

2237
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
A lot of work, energy,

2238
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
time, everything,

2239
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and then it's like,

2240
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
now we have to go to the market,

2241
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
now we have to release it,

2242
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
how will we get to the audience

2243
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that we thought we had?

2244
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
If I don't do this part right,

2245
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
if I don't do this part right,

2246
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
if I don't do this part right,

2247
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
we will release it,

2248
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
let's say, on Sunday night,

2249
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and no one will see it,

2250
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
or we will release it

2251
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
on other channels,

2252
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
and no one will see it,

2253
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
and I see that there is

2254
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
a very big possibility

2255
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
for a fail,

2256
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
whether we will sell it,

2257
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
whether the episode will be successful or not.

2258
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
The product can still be excellent.

2259
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Yes, we can have

2260
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I don't know who,

2261
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and we will totally fail,

2262
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
because this part is not right,

2263
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and the topics you touched on

2264
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
in the book you sent me,

2265
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I haven't finished the book yet,

2266
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
but I want to say

2267
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
that it is extremely important

2268
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
to understand

2269
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
who you will sell it to,

2270
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
who you will sell it to, what do you mean?

2271
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I am asked only three questions

2272
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
in the book. Who can I sell it to?

2273
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Who is my target audience?

2274
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
The second question is, who do I sell it to?

2275
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
What price do I put on it?

2276
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And the third, how do I choose channels?

2277
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And I think that the general name

2278
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
is always the target audience.

2279
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
As I said before, when I started making videos,

2280
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
if you sell it, I don't know, Moto2, or Maja,

2281
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
or Jana, it's a different price

2282
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
than if you sell it, I don't know,

2283
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
but it's a very different product

2284
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
and a different price

2285
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
depending on your decision

2286
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
on who you will sell it to.

2287
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And as far as channels are concerned,

2288
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I also have a brilliant example,

2289
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
we were making refrigeration systems

2290
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
for the self-driving vehicle,

2291
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
for one company,

2292
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
and you know that the number of pages

2293
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
in this world is measured

2294
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
in hundreds, not in thousands,

2295
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and if you happen to work

2296
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
with a fifth of those pages,

2297
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
it's much smarter

2298
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
that you just write an email,

2299
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
hello, John,

2300
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
we work so good together,

2301
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
tell me a little bit,

2302
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
where do you go to meetings,

2303
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
where do you choose magazines,

2304
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
what influencers do you follow,

2305
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
what kind of community,

2306
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and on the basis of that

2307
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
you find the other five John's

2308
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
that you can sell to,

2309
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
so that you don't have to do

2310
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
your stupid research

2311
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
So, look, there are examples

2312
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
where marketing is very simple,

2313
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
there are examples where marketing

2314
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and differentiation are very complex

2315
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
in some more competitive platforms.

2316
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But I always say,

2317
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
when you don't know, ask,

2318
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and ask those people

2319
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
who are actually your target audience,

2320
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
you can decide for yourself.

2321
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Don't you think

2322
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
that one step

2323
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
with these target audiences

2324
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
is to get

2325
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
to know them better?

2326
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
No, I don't think so.

2327
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
First of all,

2328
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
with UX, with product research,

2329
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
one of the interesting problems

2330
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
is that if you talk to people

2331
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
in private, they will try to

2332
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
talk to you and say,

2333
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
oh, great, you did it,

2334
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
because they don't want to disappoint you.

2335
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And here is the problem

2336
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
with recruiting,

2337
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
how do you recruit?

2338
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
You know, the best UX test

2339
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
is when I go to the market

2340
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
and I find an application

2341
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
and I didn't say anything

2342
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
that I would get a gift,

2343
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
but I was like, come, come.

2344
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I would like to test this

2345
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
on your phone.

2346
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
What did I get?

2347
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
An ideal environment,

2348
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
from the point of view of the network,

2349
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
so that it wasn't a laboratory environment,

2350
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
because everyone was working

2351
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
continuously, but people were

2352
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
looking at different screens

2353
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and I was always thinking,

2354
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
if you don't know, go outside,

2355
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
go and test it.

2356
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
If you ask someone to write

2357
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
some nonsense,

2358
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
what will you write in your book?

2359
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Go, show your face,

2360
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
you will get money now,

2361
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
because when you invest

2362
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
in the next 50 years,

2363
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
you can still improve.

2364
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
A brilliant example,

2365
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
you probably didn't know.

2366
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Are you ready?

2367
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
This is a business model

2368
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
of my book,

2369
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
because I wanted to sell it

2370
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
for 27, but no,

2371
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
because you won't sell it anyway.

2372
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Kindle book can't be more expensive than 10?

2373
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
No, fixed price.

2374
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Oh, wow.

2375
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I made a calculation

2376
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
and a projection.

2377
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,800
No, no, no, I mean, I probably won't be selling books through my front page as often as I do there.

2378
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,800
But now I can still adapt from the point of view of bundles, now I can trust that information.

2379
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,200
I just imagined that I would do it, that I would prepare it for the launch date.

2380
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,799
I would be surprised. I think I would be surprised, it would be terrible.

2381
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:24,200
So, look, whatever you can do here is very, very, very, very important.

2382
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:30,200
And as far as the research side is concerned, I almost see it as an excuse, right?

2383
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Because you can always remember three thousand things why you can't do some things,

2384
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,200
and why a certain thing is bad.

2385
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:40,200
But in reality, if you talk to other people, it's probably better than speculating

2386
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,599
why you may not be good at talking to people.

2387
01:15:43,599 --> 01:15:47,200
Because if nothing else, it has already been proven in society that it is not good to talk to people,

2388
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,200
which is also a purely scientific method.

2389
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:56,200
And I think this is a kind of private procrastination, or maybe sometimes a bit of a mental rabbit hole.

2390
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,200
You know, looking for things that are not convenient for you to do.

2391
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,200
I always say, look, fuck it, do it.

2392
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:08,199
Every time I do something else, I do it because I think it's the most mission critical,

2393
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:11,199
or I'm hurting my business.

2394
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,199
So, what better solution to make?

2395
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:19,199
One of the... I don't know, I hope you have it in the book.

2396
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,199
What, what, what do you have?

2397
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,199
Wikipedia says that...

2398
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,199
Wikipedia says what?

2399
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,199
You know that.

2400
01:16:26,199 --> 01:16:28,199
Troubleshooter professional.

2401
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:29,199
You know that.

2402
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,199
Correctly, Wikipedia says.

2403
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,199
Someone writes, la la la, the other is like a rabbit.

2404
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:38,199
La la la, unique value proposition of USP.

2405
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:43,199
Now, I'm really sorry I don't remember now,

2406
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,199
but one of your colleagues, I think he was also in your podcast,

2407
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:53,199
talked a lot about branding, brand perception.

2408
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:59,199
In fact, what you are, what you represent, and where that USP is,

2409
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:03,199
and how you see yourself, how others see you, and how...

2410
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,199
That was probably a transition to positioning.

2411
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,199
Transition, yes.

2412
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:08,199
He doesn't have to go into that.

2413
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:09,199
I'll see you.

2414
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,199
I'll see who you're talking to.

2415
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,199
Very good question.

2416
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:21,199
USP in the Go-To-Market strategy,

2417
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,199
how important is it, how is it connected?

2418
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:27,199
Do people need to know what your USP is,

2419
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,199
do you communicate that?

2420
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,199
Let's go back a few steps.

2421
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,199
What do you do?

2422
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:34,199
What is Product Market Fit?

2423
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:37,199
Does your audience know what Product Market Fit is?

2424
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,199
Or will you quickly explain it to the camera?

2425
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,199
What is Product Market Fit?

2426
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,199
You go first.

2427
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,199
Those terms, you go first.

2428
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:45,199
Okay.

2429
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,199
That's what he said.

2430
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,199
Okay, that's what he said.

2431
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:50,199
And that's the decision.

2432
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:51,199
Yes, again.

2433
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,199
That's what he said, that we are in the business

2434
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,199
to solve certain challenges.

2435
01:17:56,199 --> 01:18:00,199
And after we decide which challenges we want to solve,

2436
01:18:00,199 --> 01:18:03,199
we have to find people who have that challenge,

2437
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:07,199
and then make a decision that actually offers

2438
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:11,199
a solution that will solve that challenge.

2439
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,199
For example, if my dad wanted to sell me,

2440
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:16,199
I don't know, an empty sheet of paper,

2441
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:18,199
and my dad would be like,

2442
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:20,199
here's an empty sheet of paper,

2443
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:21,199
would you buy it?

2444
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,199
And I would say, no, why?

2445
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,199
It doesn't change any added value.

2446
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,199
Dad, go to Jan and try it again,

2447
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,199
because it's okay to sell.

2448
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,199
But it's very, very interesting to me,

2449
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:36,199
because here's one more thing we're missing.

2450
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:38,199
They might like the product a lot,

2451
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,199
but they'll be ready to pay for it.

2452
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:42,199
And I had a team last week

2453
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:45,199
who told me they had 24 buyers,

2454
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,199
and I got, I don't know, 4-5 emails from them.

2455
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:51,199
We actually have 4 buyers who pay us,

2456
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:55,199
and 8 who said they would start paying by the end of the year,

2457
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,199
and the rest, who we encourage a lot

2458
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:02,199
to get onboarded on the platform and do it.

2459
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:06,199
And I was like, Mayday, Mayday, we have a problem.

2460
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:10,199
So, yeah, now I could change those challenges a bit.

2461
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:12,199
And most of us, when we're struggling,

2462
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:15,199
it's not just, can we get 500 users?

2463
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,200
Can we shop those 1,000 fake emails

2464
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,200
on Discord and such challenges?

2465
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,200
But at the same time,

2466
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,200
like in the question, did we develop something

2467
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,200
that the market actually wants and solves a problem for them?

2468
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,200
Are they ready to pay us for it?

2469
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,200
And is it because they pay us,

2470
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
or can our business survive?

2471
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,200
I think that's the return on investment

2472
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,200
that's happening a lot in Europe.

2473
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,200
And I'm sorry, we don't have millions here,

2474
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
most of us don't,

2475
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,200
but it has to run in three months,

2476
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,200
because otherwise we'll have to invest

2477
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,200
our personal cash in the long run.

2478
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,200
You have three months, break it or make it.

2479
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Fair enough.

2480
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,200
Have you ever been in that situation?

2481
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,200
Yeah, we forgot, Mayday, what happened.

2482
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,200
I mean, it wasn't easy for us.

2483
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
For example, last year,

2484
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,200
we were fixing to make a new Boho,

2485
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,200
because Boho is different,

2486
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,200
and you need a new Boho, I guess.

2487
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,200
At that time, it had even worse...

2488
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,200
At that time, it had worse...

2489
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,200
At that time, it had even worse interface

2490
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
than the one you have today.

2491
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,200
And we said, OK, we'll use the latest technology,

2492
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,200
we'll make a new, nice interface,

2493
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,200
and everyone will want to use Boho,

2494
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
because we'll make it.

2495
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
We even thought of a logo,

2496
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,200
a dog that loves Boho,

2497
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,200
and that was great.

2498
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,200
Very cute, very nice,

2499
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,200
and we released it,

2500
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,200
and we said, OK, Boho doesn't have

2501
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,200
that, how do you say it,

2502
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,200
market-in-market,

2503
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,200
so it can...

2504
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,200
Anyway, we developed some features,

2505
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,200
it went really well,

2506
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,200
but again, we came across

2507
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
the problem

2508
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,200
that there wasn't

2509
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,200
a strategy, you know.

2510
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,200
How are we going to tell people

2511
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,200
that we have this Boho killer app,

2512
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,200
which will replace Boho?

2513
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,200
We came across this problem,

2514
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,200
how are we going to get

2515
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,200
the first pages to trust

2516
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,200
that we have a big enough platform

2517
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
to sell things,

2518
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,200
and to create

2519
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,200
a marketplace,

2520
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,200
all by ourselves.

2521
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,200
Yes, because you have two problems,

2522
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,200
the cold start problem,

2523
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,200
where you have to get a salary,

2524
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,200
and those who will buy it.

2525
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,200
Yes, the chicken egg problem.

2526
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,200
There are some theories

2527
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,200
on how to solve it,

2528
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,200
and it's very interesting,

2529
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,200
so if anyone is interested,

2530
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
google it.

2531
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,200
Now,

2532
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,200
what are we going to announce?

2533
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,200
We can print all the t-shirts,

2534
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,200
so we can write ads.

2535
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,200
It's just

2536
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,200
a nice example,

2537
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,200
when you get involved

2538
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,200
in being a developer,

2539
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,200
and you solve

2540
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,200
technical problems,

2541
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,200
to think about what the market needs.

2542
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,200
It's one of many.

2543
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Amazing, thank you so much for sharing this.

2544
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,200
For me,

2545
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,200
it's the most beautiful thing

2546
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
when I see an overdeveloped product.

2547
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,200
When I see how everything is done,

2548
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,200
and you are not only a technical founder,

2549
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,200
you are also a ninja,

2550
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,200
and you know how to solve things on your own.

2551
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,200
But when I see a 45-year-old

2552
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,200
from Luxembourg,

2553
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,200
who works in a corporation,

2554
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,200
and then invests in his startup,

2555
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,200
which is run by a horde of Romanian

2556
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,200
developers,

2557
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,200
and now he has his own application,

2558
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,200
which shouldn't exist,

2559
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,200
and I'm like, oh my god,

2560
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,200
this shouldn't exist.

2561
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,200
Here I see that the market wants it,

2562
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,200
the market needs it,

2563
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,200
and here I think it's so fundamental,

2564
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,200
that you know how to test everything.

2565
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,200
For example,

2566
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,200
as a freelancer,

2567
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,200
we sold our team in two days,

2568
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,200
for 20 euros,

2569
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,200
the first cohort through Word Document.

2570
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,200
Before that,

2571
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,200
we were constantly developing,

2572
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,200
and if you buy this job

2573
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,200
from PwDF, or from Pitch,

2574
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,200
or from the fact that

2575
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,200
they give you an appointment,

2576
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,200
it's different,

2577
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,200
because I'm not a developer myself,

2578
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,200
and I don't know how to develop a product,

2579
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,200
I pay for the product,

2580
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,200
and this project is not for me.

2581
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,200
So, if you know,

2582
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,200
you can still develop

2583
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,200
a minimal version,

2584
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,200
and here comes the first concept,

2585
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,200
this product,

2586
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,200
before you buy it,

2587
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,200
maybe in our region we have this tendency

2588
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,200
to give too many things for free,

2589
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,200
and then the user doesn't have

2590
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,200
the opportunity to convert,

2591
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,200
because we already solved the problem for him for free.

2592
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,200
This also happens,

2593
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,200
but

2594
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,200
it seems to me

2595
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,200
that here,

2596
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,200
a modern consumer

2597
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,200
is developing in this direction,

2598
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,200
that he wants to see things before he gives,

2599
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,200
I don't know, shut up and take my money,

2600
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,200
and here it seems to me that

2601
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,200
when you go back to transparency,

2602
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,200
you won't buy a cat in a jacket,

2603
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,200
you won't buy,

2604
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200
I don't know, that someone will solve

2605
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,200
the problem for you,

2606
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,200
before you see it,

2607
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,200
you won't, because we are sceptical,

2608
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,200
and we have already seen things,

2609
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,200
and you don't believe such promises.

2610
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,200
Crazy, isn't it?

2611
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
No, it's crazy.

2612
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
You know what the problem is?

2613
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,200
When I took your notes,

2614
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,200
that's a book,

2615
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,200
those are not notes, that's a book.

2616
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,200
Sorry, you sent me the first chapter,

2617
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,200
you didn't send me the whole book.

2618
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,200
That's the third chapter,

2619
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,200
but it's a good section.

2620
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,200
I printed it,

2621
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,200
there were so many sheets,

2622
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,200
I put two pages on one A4,

2623
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,200
and then I could put more paper in the printer.

2624
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,200
As we thought, a breakthrough.

2625
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,200
No,

2626
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,200
what else can I look at,

2627
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:01,200
what else do I have in my notebook?

2628
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,200
If you are interested,

2629
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,200
you can add more to it.

2630
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,200
Yes, I will,

2631
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,200
but we will do it later.

2632
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,200
We have one and a half,

2633
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,200
what are your plans for us?

2634
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,200
Chips.

2635
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,200
Startups.

2636
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,200
No, we will fix it.

2637
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,200
What did I write?

2638
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,200
Interesting.

2639
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Feedback loop.

2640
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,200
Maybe you can add more,

2641
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,200
I saw that in your notes.

2642
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,200
How important is the feedback loop

2643
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,200
for product development?

2644
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Tell me,

2645
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,200
what is the easiest way to do it?

2646
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,200
Does it mean

2647
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,200
that you click your page,

2648
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,200
and send an email,

2649
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,200
or measure

2650
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,200
UPS,

2651
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,200
or what is it?

2652
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,200
NPS.

2653
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,200
NPS is easy.

2654
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,200
For someone who worked

2655
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,200
in a market research company,

2656
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,200
I don't know that expression.

2657
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,200
No, it's simple.

2658
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
You are working on things,

2659
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,200
and when they are brought to you,

2660
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,200
you can learn additional things.

2661
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
But,

2662
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,200
feedback loop.

2663
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,200
The more you can learn,

2664
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,200
the faster you can grow.

2665
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,200
My hypothesis is

2666
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,200
that when you launch products

2667
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,200
or go to the market,

2668
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,200
it's two-way.

2669
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,200
It's an infinite loop.

2670
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,200
First, you can do research,

2671
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,200
then inception.

2672
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,200
I sent a tab,

2673
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,200
and when I liked the book chapter,

2674
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,200
based on your feedback,

2675
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
I created a landing page,

2676
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,200
and that landing page

2677
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,200
after 1,400 searches

2678
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,200
converts to 51%.

2679
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,200
I haven't seen it yet,

2680
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,200
and I don't know 1,400 people,

2681
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,200
so they are not my family and friends.

2682
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,200
With the fact that I learned

2683
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,200
from you with quality research,

2684
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,200
with the fact that I went

2685
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,200
to test a prototype in writing,

2686
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,200
I was able to create a product

2687
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,200
that gave me a higher level

2688
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,200
of confidence,

2689
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,200
with the fact that I was able

2690
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,200
to measure the conversion rate

2691
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,200
with a validator.

2692
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,200
And here, I think

2693
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,200
that you are doing this

2694
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,200
because of a level of confidence.

2695
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
How do you say confidence

2696
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,200
confidence

2697
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,200
that you generate?

2698
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,200
For example, if you talk to two colleagues

2699
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,200
and they tell you to buy something from you,

2700
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,200
it's not the same as if

2701
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,200
100 people swipe a card

2702
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,200
and say cash on the account.

2703
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,200
That's a different level

2704
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
of confidence.

2705
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
But for you to get an inception,

2706
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
how you will empirically

2707
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
check in the next loop,

2708
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,200
it's good to really touch

2709
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,200
your pages and talk to them,

2710
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,200
to see what's going on

2711
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,200
and if nothing is going on,

2712
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,200
call them, pick up the phone,

2713
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,200
ask them what's going on

2714
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,200
at the moment,

2715
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,200
it will take you a few minutes,

2716
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,200
but from all this talk,

2717
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,200
a few days will come.

2718
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,200
For this kind of research,

2719
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,200
people pay 20 euros a month

2720
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
so that others do it

2721
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,200
for them, so that they don't need it.

2722
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,200
So these things really have

2723
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,200
a lot of added value.

2724
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,200
Still, you don't want to be

2725
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,200
in touch with people,

2726
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,200
so give them an exit poll on the split page

2727
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,200
and ask them what's stopping you

2728
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
from becoming a premium subscriber

2729
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
today and you will learn a lot

2730
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,200
from it and then find

2731
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,200
really good studies that you can improve.

2732
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,200
So for me,

2733
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,200
the research part and then

2734
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,200
experimenting and having

2735
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,200
these assumptions and

2736
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,200
testing them,

2737
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,200
what could be my critical assumption,

2738
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,200
that I have to sell Kindle

2739
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,200
for more than 10 euros.

2740
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,200
If I pushed it,

2741
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,200
launch over, it wouldn't be good.

2742
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,200
The economy of the project would collapse.

2743
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,200
And these things are good

2744
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,200
between mapping forward and

2745
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,200
having a methodology of how it can be done.

2746
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,200
Now, through a change like a math scientist,

2747
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,200
probably... No.

2748
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,200
No? Makes sense? No.

2749
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,200
I mean, I've only gone through

2750
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,200
one chapter, so I don't know what's left,

2751
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,200
but...

2752
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
You already got added value here.

2753
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
I got added value.

2754
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
I got added value.

2755
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,200
One question, I'm still

2756
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,200
interested in this topic.

2757
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,200
It seems to me that when you're a start-up,

2758
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,200
when you're a

2759
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,200
pizza-size team,

2760
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,200
when you're behind the scenes,

2761
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,200
it may seem

2762
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
that it's a lie to do those things

2763
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,200
and maybe you don't realize that it's your advantage.

2764
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,200
That's totally your advantage.

2765
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
Yes, that you're just wrong.

2766
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,200
You're just wrong.

2767
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,200
You have nothing to lose, but...

2768
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,200
These questions are important

2769
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,200
for start-ups,

2770
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,200
for SMEs,

2771
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,200
and for corporations.

2772
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,200
And probably the bigger you are,

2773
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,200
the more dependent you are on

2774
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,200
the go-to-market strategy.

2775
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,200
Totally. Can I ask you

2776
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,200
one more question? Because I know what's

2777
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,200
coming next, but...

2778
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,200
No, I'm done with my next question.

2779
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,200
I don't know, but okay.

2780
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
Okay, then I'll let you finish.

2781
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,200
When you said that,

2782
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,200
I was asked if I knew

2783
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,200
how much work it would take to

2784
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,200
write a book again.

2785
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,200
Why did you ask that?

2786
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,200
Sara Stojanovski.

2787
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,200
She's a very good friend of mine.

2788
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,200
Great, because I'm a customer discovery ninja.

2789
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,200
You have such a reasonable part

2790
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,200
around you.

2791
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,200
My team in Grodno is very...

2792
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,200
We don't have such a deep...

2793
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,200
We're much more...

2794
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,200
Let's just do it.

2795
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,200
That's great, isn't it?

2796
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,200
I think we'd need someone

2797
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
with a voice of reason.

2798
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,200
It pays off.

2799
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,200
I don't know.

2800
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,200
For me, it would be more

2801
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,200
retrospective than anything else.

2802
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,200
She asked me if I would do it again.

2803
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,200
I said no.

2804
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,200
I really wouldn't.

2805
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,200
It would be awful.

2806
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,200
You're done with writing a book.

2807
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,200
With a note.

2808
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,200
I wrote 1,500 pages.

2809
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,200
It was awful.

2810
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,200
Now there will be 250 users.

2811
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,200
What would they teach me?

2812
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,200
Because of that...

2813
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,200
First of all, I know how to work with data.

2814
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,200
I talk all day.

2815
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,200
If you ask most of my team what they do all day,

2816
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,200
they answer the phone and talk.

2817
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,200
They think that.

2818
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,200
I work in a restaurant, I do strategy and partnerships.

2819
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,200
But it's very, very, very

2820
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,200
important to me.

2821
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,200
What kind of person do you

2822
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,200
work with on that path?

2823
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,200
For example, when you have a product

2824
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,200
to work on,

2825
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,200
I always tell my team

2826
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
that you will observe more

2827
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,200
the things you didn't do than the things you did.

2828
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,200
And you can see

2829
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,200
what the conclusion is.

2830
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,200
I understand that you're afraid.

2831
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,200
I understand that it's weird for you to do it.

2832
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,200
I understand that you're running your last mile here.

2833
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,200
But do it.

2834
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,200
Do it, because you'll never see anything else.

2835
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,200
True.

2836
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,200
Older people are better.

2837
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,199
You realize that you always have

2838
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,199
some...

2839
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,199
time.

2840
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,199
Some time for that.

2841
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,199
Would it be possible

2842
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,199
for you to think about

2843
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,199
getting some younger employees?

2844
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,199
No, no, no.

2845
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,199
No.

2846
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,199
Assistants.

2847
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,199
We still have a lot of time,

2848
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:27,199
but we'll be able to talk about it later.

2849
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:29,199
Are we recording?

2850
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,199
I don't know exactly when, but I don't know.

2851
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,199
I think it's half an hour.

2852
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:37,199
Okay.

2853
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,199
In...

2854
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,199
Growth Hacking.

2855
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,199
I'll go back to Growth Hacking,

2856
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,199
because that's also a topic

2857
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,199
you're interested in.

2858
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,199
I want to be more associated with it

2859
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,199
because I have bad rap.

2860
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:53,199
Why?

2861
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,199
I really don't like it.

2862
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,199
I have a course

2863
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:59,199
made by 70,000 people.

2864
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,199
And on a daily basis

2865
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,199
I get 20 messages

2866
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,199
from gentlemen and ladies

2867
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:07,199
from India and Pakistan.

2868
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:09,199
And then this

2869
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,199
outsourcing started.

2870
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,199
Lady Majority,

2871
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,199
SCOS, Growth Hacking,

2872
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,199
and so on.

2873
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,199
Here I am.

2874
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,199
I have a lot of good friends.

2875
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,199
I know a lot of influencers

2876
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,199
from this field.

2877
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,199
I told them

2878
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,199
that we believe in the method of experimentation.

2879
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,199
We believe that

2880
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,199
instead of thinking about

2881
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,199
what you do in marketing

2882
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,199
and that you count on your genius,

2883
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,199
creativity and whatnots,

2884
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,199
you measure and get data

2885
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,199
and get feedback

2886
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,199
if you could do more or less.

2887
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:47,199
If we call it experimentation,

2888
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,199
Growth Hacking,

2889
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,199
Agile Marketing,

2890
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:53,199
I can't do it.

2891
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,199
I'm sorry that

2892
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,199
5 Growth Hackers

2893
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,199
will tell me how to hack

2894
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:01,199
their SEO, split pages.

2895
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,199
It's not because I went to science.

2896
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,199
It's not because I went to science.

2897
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,199
I went to science because I believed

2898
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:09,199
that there is a scientific approach

2899
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,199
in something that I was taught

2900
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,199
on a fax machine.

2901
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:17,199
I think we need

2902
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,199
rebranding.

2903
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:21,199
That was about Growth Hacking.

2904
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:23,199
Everyone said to me,

2905
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,199
yes, you can grow products

2906
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,199
that have a good product market fit.

2907
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,199
My point is, nobody told you how to get there.

2908
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,199
You can choose

2909
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,199
and with those blanks and tasks,

2910
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,199
I said,

2911
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,199
I wanted to write

2912
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,199
not a cookie cutter recipe,

2913
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,199
but I wanted to write step by step

2914
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,199
what you can do and what you can be aware of

2915
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,199
so that it will be more likely for you

2916
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,199
that you can confidently

2917
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,199
prepare.

2918
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,199
Back to my question.

2919
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,199
What was it?

2920
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,199
What was it?

2921
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,199
Growth Hacking.

2922
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,199
Then I went to rent.

2923
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,199
I wrote down

2924
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:05,199
some points. Criticism.

2925
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,199
We've already talked about that.

2926
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,199
Maybe Zete would like to

2927
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,199
say something.

2928
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:13,199
In your book,

2929
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,199
also in

2930
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,199
Market Strategist,

2931
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,199
you have written MongoDB.

2932
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,199
I think you have it.

2933
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,199
And

2934
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,199
a bunch of other brands.

2935
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,199
Now,

2936
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,199
when we first talked at the beginning

2937
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,199
about developers and

2938
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,199
some skepticism

2939
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,199
about developers and

2940
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,199
adversity

2941
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,199
in marketing.

2942
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,199
I'm nervous.

2943
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,199
A big

2944
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,199
challenge

2945
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,199
or problem is that

2946
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,199
tech companies

2947
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,199
can have

2948
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,199
excellent marketing

2949
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,199
and can

2950
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,199
oversell.

2951
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,199
Yes, build products.

2952
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,199
It's not necessary to build a product,

2953
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,199
but they can only position it

2954
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,199
in an unintended space

2955
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,199
or sell some features

2956
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,199
that are not stable.

2957
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:11,199
Before that

2958
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:13,199
it was a big step.

2959
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,199
Then it happened that

2960
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,199
the whole world

2961
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,199
used MongoDB in the same way

2962
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,199
for the same things.

2963
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,199
Because the marketing

2964
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,199
from MongoDB is very good.

2965
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,199
They hack at college.

2966
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,199
I have written here

2967
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,199
that RitinkDB is an example

2968
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,199
of a company that

2969
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,199
went bankrupt, but their

2970
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,199
opinion was that they are very good,

2971
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,199
they know how to do it,

2972
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,199
excellent documentation,

2973
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,199
excellent sales,

2974
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:45,199
webinars, videos, conferences,

2975
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,199
all this machinery works,

2976
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,199
but at the end of the day

2977
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,199
the features that went wrong

2978
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:53,199
were not delivered.

2979
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,199
This is

2980
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,199
some kind of criticism

2981
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,199
where I see that

2982
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,199
on my side they come to the point

2983
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,199
that I'm angry

2984
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,199
about technology.

2985
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,199
Probably my colleagues

2986
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,199
have such experiences.

2987
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,199
It is said that

2988
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,199
you learn, but is it really good

2989
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,199
marketing or is it just

2990
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,199
technology? Very good.

2991
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,199
These things

2992
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:21,199
are very

2993
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,199
challenging.

2994
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:25,199
That's why people are so

2995
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,199
attached to it.

2996
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,199
It makes sense, because when you learn something,

2997
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,199
it probably lasts months and months,

2998
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:33,199
and when I learn to click something,

2999
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,199
it lasts a few minutes.

3000
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:37,199
The investment we have

3001
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,199
to adopt a new

3002
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:41,199
technological tool and framework

3003
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,199
is very different.

3004
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,199
Sorry if I wasted 15 minutes

3005
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:47,199
talking about whether I liked

3006
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:49,199
Canon or Google Meetings,

3007
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,199
it really has no

3008
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,199
radical consequences,

3009
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:55,199
but you saw that it has consequences.

3010
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:57,199
You have to perceive it differently.

3011
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,199
I think

3012
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,199
that here

3013
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,199
the product has grown

3014
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,199
and the buzzword

3015
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,199
for me is show, don't tell.

3016
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,199
Give cash back if you can't deliver.

3017
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:11,199
No questions asked.

3018
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,199
That sounds much simpler.

3019
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:15,199
If I have a system

3020
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:17,199
and a website that depends on

3021
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:19,199
my income, for example,

3022
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,199
and does not deliver

3023
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,199
the whole product because

3024
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:25,199
the technology is not accurate

3025
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,199
and was chosen

3026
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,199
on the basis of hype,

3027
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:31,199
not on the basis of

3028
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,199
research accuracy,

3029
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,199
that's a problem.

3030
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,199
That was my criticism.

3031
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,199
Here, like Shopify,

3032
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,199
they are ridiculously expensive

3033
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,199
when scaling.

3034
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,199
At first, it sounds good,

3035
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,199
but then it jumps a bit.

3036
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:49,199
For example, if you choose

3037
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,199
at the beginning and think

3038
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,199
in the course of one year

3039
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:55,199
what is your best decision,

3040
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,199
if you are a good entrepreneur

3041
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,199
in the 5th or 10th year,

3042
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,199
what is your scaleable business,

3043
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,199
who is your scaleable team,

3044
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:05,199
if you have to make decisions,

3045
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:07,199
is it always possible?

3046
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,199
No, because we are not fully informed.

3047
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,199
So it's great that you pay attention to these things.

3048
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,199
Okay.

3049
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:15,199
You could have guessed

3050
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,199
that you answered me so nicely.

3051
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,199
No, I'm not.

3052
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,199
I hang out with Simon Pilak a lot.

3053
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:23,199
He's in good shape now.

3054
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:25,199
Now, what else?

3055
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,199
That other thing was too cool.

3056
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,199
I thought you were going to say

3057
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,199
that you are old-fashioned.

3058
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,199
I saw your LinkedIn profile.

3059
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:35,199
Oh my God.

3060
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:37,199
I'm sorry.

3061
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,199
You have a lot of...

3062
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:41,199
I wanted to say that you have

3063
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,199
in companies where you work

3064
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,199
too little written what you paid.

3065
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:47,199
Great.

3066
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:49,199
I had LinkedIn growth.

3067
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,199
Are you going to give anything

3068
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,199
for LinkedIn growth?

3069
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,199
No, but I would use this opportunity

3070
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,199
to see

3071
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,199
that...

3072
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,600
People don't know how powerful LinkedIn is, how important it is for them,

3073
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:10,160
and the growth you've made, how did you make it, I don't know.

3074
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,040
Without permission.

3075
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,840
Yeah, anyway, you mentioned it.

3076
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:21,840
It's very visible and very important, especially for young juniors who don't know what to write online.

3077
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:28,559
But LinkedIn has become your online image, your identity, whatever.

3078
01:40:28,559 --> 01:40:32,480
Give more attention to this topic.

3079
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:39,279
That idea came to me, that somehow I have to look at people as part of this podcast or something.

3080
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:40,799
Hey, can I say something about that?

3081
01:40:40,799 --> 01:40:42,799
I have to get your brain out of your ass.

3082
01:40:42,799 --> 01:40:45,680
No, you said it so nicely here on LinkedIn.

3083
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,480
Now I'll tell you one more thing, come on, let me do this.

3084
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,680
So how can we, when we work in marketing and sales,

3085
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,639
what can we do here so that we don't become a developer's cringe?

3086
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,639
How can we be normal to developers and engineers?

3087
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,639
I think it's a very good strategy.

3088
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,639
For example, what we see with Developer Advocates.

3089
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,199
For example, I don't know, Žan Markani was one of our guests before,

3090
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:15,919
who is actually a person who is a former developer,

3091
01:41:15,919 --> 01:41:19,040
who worked with developers, who was a developer.

3092
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,040
So was my John Cutler.

3093
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:25,919
And at some point he decided to choose someone else.

3094
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:27,919
Influencer.

3095
01:41:27,919 --> 01:41:34,639
But he goes to tech conferences, is with developers, understands their problems,

3096
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:39,120
brings the problems back to the headquarters and discusses them.

3097
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:43,599
He's there, he's a bit like preparing all these channels,

3098
01:41:43,599 --> 01:41:48,480
and he's not an outsider, but he's actually an insider.

3099
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,480
He's an embed.

3100
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,480
He's an advocate from the inside.

3101
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:59,599
I think it's really worth it for the business and for the community.

3102
01:41:59,599 --> 01:42:02,800
Because he knows what the trends are, he knows what the plants are that are coming,

3103
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,760
he knows what they are.

3104
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,760
He speaks the language.

3105
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,760
Yes, he speaks the language.

3106
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,759
And he's not a fake, he's that.

3107
01:42:13,759 --> 01:42:15,759
That's very important.

3108
01:42:15,759 --> 01:42:17,759
I saw the same thing with John Cutler at Amplitude,

3109
01:42:17,759 --> 01:42:19,759
and with Ben Williams at Snyk.

3110
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:23,759
These guys, I mean, again, I'm afraid of them, like I'm afraid of you,

3111
01:42:23,759 --> 01:42:27,759
because I know that you won't do all this bullshit,

3112
01:42:27,759 --> 01:42:31,759
because sometimes we serve them in the world.

3113
01:42:31,759 --> 01:42:36,720
I think it's great to choose a partner when you're ready to listen to them.

3114
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,720
Because we all think well,

3115
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:42,720
we think that we bring some technologies and solutions to the world,

3116
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,720
that they will be OK.

3117
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:47,759
But we also need you to deal with us.

3118
01:42:47,759 --> 01:42:52,720
You know, I come from Biskul, so I'm not the smartest person in the world.

3119
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,720
I'm just saying that I'm not.

3120
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:58,720
If I don't have a developer or someone who explains these things to me,

3121
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,720
what we sell, what we do and what Roadmap is,

3122
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,720
I will probably have a very bad time in my job and I won't be able to do it.

3123
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,720
It's all the same for developers.

3124
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:12,720
As a developer, as an engineer, you can't be good and efficient

3125
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,720
if you don't understand where that money is flowing to.

3126
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,720
So I'm trying my best.

3127
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,720
Shocking.

3128
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,720
Shocking, but I'm trying my best.

3129
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,720
It's not a big problem.

3130
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,720
Nothing, let's wrap it up.

3131
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,720
Thank you very much.

3132
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,720
I know you have a little more to say.

3133
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,720
Do you have anything to add?

3134
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,720
Or do you want a burek on the web?

3135
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,720
Let's try something better than a burek.

3136
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,720
No, thank you very much.

3137
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,720
This conversation meant so much to me

3138
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,720
because I learned to fit in here

3139
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:48,720
as if I were a victim of being discriminated against by developers.

3140
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:52,720
But really, I haven't said a word in 10 years.

3141
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,720
But I had an interest.

3142
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,720
At that time, I only needed a mentor.

3143
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,720
And he was the one who supported me,

3144
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,720
who supported me,

3145
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,720
and who brought me all this.

3146
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,720
Here, we still need more developers,

3147
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,720
and more people who will stand up for themselves.

3148
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,720
And we, as a business,

3149
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,720
can give you a point or two

3150
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,720
as a substitute

3151
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,720
so that you can create a website.

3152
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
So that's it. Let's go.

3153
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,720
Let's go. Oh my God.

3154
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,720
Kepica.com.

3155
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,720
Kepica.com.

3156
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,720
Wait a minute.

3157
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,720
Thank you to everyone who stayed until the end.

3158
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,720
Long live Matej.

3159
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,720
No, wait.

3160
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,720
At 45 minutes, we would like to thank

3161
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,720
our supporters and sponsors.

3162
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:38,720
So we thank HumanFrog and 3FSA for their support.

3163
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,720
We also thank Patreon

3164
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,720
for their support.

3165
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,720
And everyone who is with us.

3166
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,720
Maja, thank you very much for this conversation.

3167
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,720
Maybe some other time.

3168
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,720
Maybe some other time.

3169
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,720
No, thank you.

3170
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,720
Okay, super. The best.
