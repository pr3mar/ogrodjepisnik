1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here it is, this boat is meant for us to hitchhike, so I can hitchhike up, you know, so it will come in handy.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, you know, the jingles have run out.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First of all, I would like to say hello to both of you in the new episode of Ogrodio.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Andraž really wanted Ogrodio to be able to talk about something intimate, to be able to talk in peace.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, in fact, a few months ago, we heard that she would come and record this for us.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we had the idea that she really is an ideal guest for our show, this intimate scene.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Such a little dark light, a little bit of smoke.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And then we thought, let's have it on the bridge.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When it will be more intimate.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When it will be more intimate, with this live audience, with all the noise.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We are waiting for the engine to start.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Here, between the two political parties, you have a stand.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, today we are filming in Dejansko, we are also live streaming this episode of Ogrodio.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now we are filming on the stand of the company Human Frog.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is a company that also supports us on our path.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So that's why we took this opportunity.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I hope that Jan will be able to record the sound in 5 days.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So that it will be proper and that everything will be fine.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So that all the listeners won't say that this is inaudible and so on.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We will use all the AI to fix it.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, when we were preparing for the episode with Urško, we all wanted to animate.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We said that maybe it would be best to give you a powerful question first.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then I will ask you who you are.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A powerful question.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me tell you why you see hackathons as a good way to innovate.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are hackathons your tools, your mission, your lifestyle?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All of the above.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
First of all, thank you in advance.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I really wanted to be here from the start.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I was preparing for the show on the bridge.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I didn't know that the show would be on the bridge.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was waiting for the idea to come.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It was not so easy.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you for waiting for me.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hackathons, Ogrodio, business, mission.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Absolutely.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Because what I have learned over the years,

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is that the energy that happens there,

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
even the most skeptical customers,

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
come to the end and say,

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
hey, we want a little more of this,

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
also for us in the space, in Pundelk.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You, Otoš, were really crazy about it.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But it's hard to explain to people what kind of vibe happens

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
when people start creating,

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
when they forget all the obstacles.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All that was not possible in the morning,

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
starts to disappear.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And then that energy, that hype, that adrenaline,

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
that they will create something in just two days.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's what I always say.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
After eight years,

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
this is the best way to spend the weekend.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We go to parties,

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and I'm like, I'm a hackathon.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You said it like that,

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Urška works only during the weekends.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
During the week, she's happy.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I won't say that I really like to work,

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but after the hackathon,

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
in Pundelk in the morning,

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I sit down with the same energy,

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I treat the team and everything else,

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
what to do next.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I wanted to say that

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
some people go to parties,

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
some people go to Zrče,

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
some to EXIT,

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but I have a saying,

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
we have a hackathon,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we can do it,

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and this weekend,

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we can do it.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Is this the end?

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Forever 42.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Did you leave a mark on 42?

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You say 42 and more.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I said that everything that will be asked,

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
because we know that 42 will be the answer forever.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But a lot, because there are so many of them,

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
we do it internally,

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
just for business,

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and in those fields,

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
we don't talk publicly,

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
because everything is done,

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
something is being done for them internally,

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
so this weekend,

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we had two.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now maybe those segues,

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
we stopped this question,

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and jumped directly into the water,

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to the hackathon,

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but let's take a step back.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Who is Urška?

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Who are you?

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
42.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Can I continue now?

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No, I mean,

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll say it differently.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I met you

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
when you came to our office,

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to look for your father,

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
who was on a hackathon.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The office was so energetic,

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
even though you came

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
with Hristo Ljubljanaški,

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
who is here today,

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but so energetic,

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
so full of energy,

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
so passionate,

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
so much,

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
transformation,

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
innovations,

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
on a higher level,

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
so I don't know,

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you were there in the morning,

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and I was like,

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
where is this female energy coming from?

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you, Andraž,

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I didn't see it that way,

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
but really, thank you.

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know, it's hard to say,

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
because I've been asked many times,

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
does life support me somehow?

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know if I'm asking

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
who I am,

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the eternal optimist,

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but I've decided

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that you always have a chance,

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you sit down and cry,

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and everyone is guilty,

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
or you sit down

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and say, oh, why me,

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and you say, hey, look,

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
it was supposed to be like this,

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and then it turned into something

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
nicer and nicer,

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and I always believed

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
that it was much better,

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and I think we have a little too little

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
of this sun, heat, energy,

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that I've ever seen in the world.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I know it sounds like a cliché,

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but that's how I live.

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Great,

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
for me it's too little of this,

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
too little of this,

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and then when you meet such a person,

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
who lives this business,

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
or really,

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
somewhere I'm passionate about it,

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
it's not like, let's sell something,

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and earn some money,

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but when you've seen

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
how happy you are,

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know,

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
now I have a question about you,

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
when people say to me,

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
oh, you do these things,

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
IT geeks and such,

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
they get tired,

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
they get tired of hanging out,

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
how do you convey this energy,

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that I can tell you what I see,

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
this, this, this,

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and you see Rototunarap,

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
screaming and everything,

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
but you see that smile,

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and you say,

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that's good,

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that's good,

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that's good,

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that's good,

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
those hackathons,

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that you organize,

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I was probably,

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
maybe a few percent less than you,

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but,

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
those are

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
marathon events,

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
marathon and sprint,

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
in one weekend,

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to do something,

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to create an idea,

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
to develop,

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to get to know the subject,

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to get to know the problem,

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to do a solution,

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to present a solution,

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to communicate with other stakeholders,

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that's just how you should experience it.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, you know,

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
if you don't have enough energy

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in that locomotive,

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
people will say,

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
oh, look,

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the organizers,

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that's stupid,

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
let's go to Zrča,

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
or whatever,

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so I think that,

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
considering that I've been

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to good and bad hackathons,

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
it's very important,

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
what kind of energy is generated,

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
besides, you know,

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it's important for everything,

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
it's not a goal,

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but hackathons,

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
maybe,

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
work with people,

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but you have to be fast.

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
First of all,

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
people don't know how to imagine it,

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
participants know

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
what they are going to solve,

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
because they are prepared.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But most of the time,

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
let's say, on Saturday morning,

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
members of the team

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
get to know each other on Saturday morning,

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and at night,

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
at 6.30 p.m.,

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
they have to connect,

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
build, create an interesting solution,

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
talk to each other,

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and prepare the right speech,

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
not just one-hour speech,

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
or five-minute speech,

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and all that,

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
besides being technical,

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you always have to add

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
a little bit of professionalism,

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
so practically,

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you have them completely

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
focused on the adrenaline,

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and then it's good

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
if we come up with

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
a little bit of ingenuity,

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What is hackathon?

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We are all here,

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
all three of us are talking,

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
because we all know.

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Maybe we should talk about

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Andraž in the hackathon.

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do we have to invite him?

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No, it's a challenge for everyone.

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's also a challenge,

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
this term is very

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
exploited, used,

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
people also

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
make some wrong assumptions,

254
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you can also

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
use a lot of people,

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
a lot of companies,

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
for example,

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
they organize things by themselves,

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
they don't know exactly

260
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
what to prepare,

261
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
what will happen,

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
what people expect,

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and a lot of people

264
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
are on both sides.

265
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Maybe it's in the sense

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
of how to organize a hackathon.

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's go to the break.

268
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is easy marathon innovation.

269
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What does it mean?

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you have a one-hour job,

271
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
two-hour job, three, four,

272
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
this sprint can't be a hackathon,

273
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
because it's a marathon.

274
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is exactly what Otto said,

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
because of the trend,

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
everyone got a hackathon label.

277
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
A hackathon is a marathon

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
of innovation,

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
where you come up with

280
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
an idea or a problem

281
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
that needs to be solved,

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
people get together,

283
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
it doesn't matter,

284
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the question is always

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
who can participate in a hackathon.

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Whoever has the desire and energy,

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
even if it's for a very technical

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
or very business-oriented job,

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
as little as a person

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
from the outside,

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
we will get a more diversified solution.

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That is, thinking out of the box.

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Exactly.

294
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And the passion to solve something,

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to be something.

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We had a daily attendance

297
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
of 13,

298
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
an old girl,

299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and the oldest, I think you were 63,

300
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
at A-Bank.

301
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
At A-Bank I wasn't.

302
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes, we found one where he wasn't.

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He was 63,

304
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
very excited,

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and then we asked him why,

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and he said, straight to the point,

307
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I've been a committee member for so many decades

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that I don't think

309
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
there's ever been a sign

310
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that my bank has gone.

311
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
True that.

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it doesn't matter.

313
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He came, competed,

314
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
he was with the young people in the team,

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
he had a good team,

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the team had a good time,

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
so really, the desire must be there.

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, why do the participants appear?

319
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There are different motivations.

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Which change.

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Motivations change.

322
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The father will then ask him

323
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
what all the deals were.

324
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now, at first, he's like,

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can't sleep,

326
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't sleep.

327
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't sleep.

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't sleep.

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't sleep.

330
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I have written here

331
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
a few steps through the hackathon,

332
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and then at the beginning,

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the goal.

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can also return to the question,

335
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
how do you prepare

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
for the hackathon

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and how do you prepare

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and probably

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
many of the hackathons

340
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
we've been to, both of them,

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
are very different

342
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
because how well do you set the goal?

343
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What are we going to hack?

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What are we going to develop?

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why are we doing this goal?

346
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What is it for?

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
My first question is,

348
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
first of all, I want to understand why we do it.

349
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because

350
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
some people don't even know what it is

351
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and they think it's fine,

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but when you ask them why they do it,

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
we also start to think,

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
what are we going to do

355
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
with this hackathon?

356
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you know that you would like to have it

357
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
because it's good to do it,

358
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
fine, but we already have a problem

359
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that you would like to solve.

360
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And when it happens,

361
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
we will call you back.

362
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I would imagine,

363
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
if I interrupt you,

364
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that, I don't know,

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
how it is in Slovenia,

366
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
if you have experience,

367
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I see that Slovenian companies

368
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
do it because it's good PR,

369
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
because it's a good way

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to quickly do some recruitment

371
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
or get some potential staff,

372
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that it's a site.

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The question is,

374
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
how many of these companies

375
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
really want to solve

376
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
some innovative problem

377
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that they want to solve?

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That it's more about

379
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
brand awareness,

380
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
how we,

381
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
as a bank,

382
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
that we are still

383
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
relevant,

384
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we are looking for a staff

385
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
because we will

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
renovate the IT department

387
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
or something like that.

388
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Is it more in this direction

389
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
or are there companies

390
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
that actually see this

391
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
as we are looking for

392
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
something to solve

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
or we want to make our product

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
on a different level

395
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and we need some

396
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
untrained people

397
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
from inside the company

398
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and maybe someone in the business

399
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that sees it differently

400
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
or how to make it

401
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
a business model or something like that.

402
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Very good question

403
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and also very complex

404
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
to tell you from the right.

405
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Most of our customers,

406
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and I'm saying this out loud,

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
because I have to have

408
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
a satisfied customer

409
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and all the participants.

410
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
My task is to make the participants

411
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
happy and to get something out of it.

412
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What I mean is that I want to have

413
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
a clear picture of what will happen.

414
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Now most people come in

415
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
with the idea that they will develop

416
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and look for a new product.

417
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
A lot of times when they see

418
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
what comes from Hackathon

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
they start to hesitate

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and wait for Unicorn.

421
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
On Sunday night Unicorn will be born

422
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and on Monday they will sell it

423
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
on the market.

424
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You said that all companies

425
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
have a lot of skills.

426
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Vrhunjski was on the development

427
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and I know that Triglav was also there.

428
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They are the first example of a personal

429
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Hackathon where they were looking

430
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
for something new,

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
for the future,

432
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
2017, 2018,

433
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and then they decided

434
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
to put Unicorn in development

435
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and we worked with them

436
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
on the development of the product

437
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
with a team from Hackathon

438
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
plus an internal team from Triglav.

439
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It was a mixed team.

440
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The team that developed the idea,

441
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
they did interviews,

442
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
a bit of a strange competition

443
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and so on,

444
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
we led them through everything

445
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
because that is our role in the end.

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That is what we do after Hackathon.

447
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But what happened here?

448
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What was so unique

449
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
was that this team

450
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
did the software solutions

451
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and this team organized

452
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the software solutions.

453
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We also did a developer Hackathon

454
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
where they knew exactly

455
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that this team from the first Hackathon

456
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
came in three months to this

457
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and now we need a solution for that.

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So all companies,

459
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I would say,

460
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
not even 50% of them

461
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
manage to make a long-term implementation.

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We need to be aware of this

463
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and we are back to

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Unicorn is not born on a Sunday night.

465
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Can I say it again?

466
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Unicorn is not born on a Sunday night.

467
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And then when you go

468
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
in the development of the product

469
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
from zero to one

470
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
according to startup methodologies,

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you realize many times

472
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
that the market does not need

473
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
what Hackathon and hackers think.

474
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But because you can write

475
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and talk about Hackathon

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and it is open for the public

477
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and for the students,

478
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
this next step is not known.

479
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Because the next day

480
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
when we come to the handbook

481
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and then one day

482
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
you can say

483
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
that we are still developing

484
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and we will not say anything

485
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
until the product is ready

486
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
for launch.

487
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And I can say at this moment

488
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
that we have two products

489
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
ready for launch.

490
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And because of this,

491
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
it is not so complicated

492
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
because you just make a handbook

493
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
for your customers.

494
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I have a couple of questions.

495
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
One is

496
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
42.

497
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
42.

498
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It is what you said.

499
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The product is developing

500
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and you have

501
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
MVP.

502
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's what I meant.

503
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's what I meant.

504
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So,

505
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
from the MVP

506
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
to the handbook

507
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
or the developer of the

508
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hackathon handbook,

509
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
you implement it

510
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
so that the product

511
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
is ready for launch?

512
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes.

513
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you have

514
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
a good story

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that there is a product

516
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that has developed?

517
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Can I say it?

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I would like to know

519
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
because then the participants

520
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
also sign it.

521
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
My question is

522
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
because

523
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
as I understand

524
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
or I had the opportunity to see,

525
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the participants

526
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
give their forgiveness.

527
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They are paid

528
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
with some kind

529
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
of your positive energy,

530
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
customer wishes,

531
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
pizzas,

532
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
drinks and so on.

533
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We have a great catering.

534
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They eat well

535
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
because I am a gourmet.

536
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Now my wife

537
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
will listen to this

538
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and she will say why do you go to the Hackathon

539
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and everything you get is pizza.

540
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No, no, no.

541
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Pizza comes at the end.

542
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, no, no.

543
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
My question is

544
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
what did he get?

545
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He showed something there.

546
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It was a prototype.

547
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Maybe he was not chosen for the best.

548
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Something like that.

549
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And here

550
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
a Nendy is signed.

551
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The company can pick it up.

552
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
A famous shot.

553
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Maybe I am exaggerating.

554
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
All right, all right.

555
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Directly in the straight of the heart.

556
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It is practical.

557
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's be practical.

558
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I went through the whole process

559
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
because the candidates

560
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
were paid for it.

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But of course,

562
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
we have to understand

563
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the mentality of the corporation.

564
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We paid a lot for it.

565
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We will give awards.

566
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
They give their people

567
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
for the weekend.

568
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
In their budget

569
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
they thought

570
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
we will have an IP

571
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
when the weekend happens at the Hackathon.

572
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Now we are back to what happens

573
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
at the Hackathon.

574
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Practically

575
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
it is like this.

576
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
At the Open Data Hackathon

577
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
where there is a lot of open data

578
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
for everything and everything

579
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
there is a person

580
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
who wants to know

581
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
what is going to happen.

582
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
However, the next day

583
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
when we come to the meeting

584
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
we will see what are the real possibilities

585
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and not.

586
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And if this team

587
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
would like to develop it

588
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
it will be signed

589
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Go for it!

590
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Run, be happy!

591
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
In a specific example

592
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I would give a euro

593
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
if I think

594
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that this team will do it.

595
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, if someone would like

596
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
to know how many

597
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
42 people came

598
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
to ask for it

599
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
one team.

600
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This famous IP

601
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
is just a storm of spirits.

602
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When you tell them

603
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that they can come

604
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
everyone is happy

605
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and only one came to ask

606
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
to sign an IP

607
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and we will do it.

608
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And this team

609
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
is developing it

610
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
in Austria.

611
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We are not interested

612
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
in your ideas

613
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
from one hackathon

614
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
to another.

615
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Your job is to make sure

616
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that the clients are protected.

617
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It is hard to say

618
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
who is important to me.

619
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It is just

620
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
something that can be known

621
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
through a hackathon.

622
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
When I start a hackathon

623
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I always change with an appointment

624
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and I don't have an appointment

625
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
for a hackathon.

626
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I am there for the participants

627
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to feel good.

628
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
If there is a moment

629
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
when someone has a problem

630
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I will moderate

631
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the relations

632
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and the meeting

633
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
ends on Sunday evening.

634
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If we talk about the participants

635
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and the development of the product

636
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
we have a program

637
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
similar to startup incubation

638
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and participants

639
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
are usually paid

640
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
a fee for it.

641
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
They get a reward

642
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
for the weekend

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and a fee for the program.

644
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
As I mentioned

645
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
a few minutes ago

646
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the MVP team

647
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
has shown

648
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
that there is a case

649
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and they have signed

650
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
a partnership agreement

651
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and they are developing

652
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
it including

653
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
the maintenance of the system.

654
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
In the beginning

655
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
we make sure

656
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that everything is fair play

657
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
because you can't

658
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
start a hackathon

659
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
if you don't like it.

660
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I always try to explain

661
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
to the participants

662
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that they need to understand

663
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
what a hackathon is.

664
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The only thing that holds them back

665
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
is the IP member inside.

666
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He writes that it is his

667
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and he feels good about it.

668
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Whatever happens, it is all his.

669
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We also have to make sure

670
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
that he is moderate

671
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
because if he starts a hackathon

672
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you can't do anything

673
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
because it is not ours.

674
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I would like to add a few words.

675
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
From my perspective

676
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
as a developer

677
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
we all talk about

678
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
TechDevPodcast

679
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
but these events are not

680
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
only developers' hackathons

681
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but also businesses

682
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
so let's not be afraid of it.

683
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I would say

684
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that you should

685
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
look for a partnership

686
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and at the beginning

687
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
there is a nice link

688
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
where you can sign up

689
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and there is a search engine

690
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
where you can sign up

691
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and there is a search engine

692
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
where you can sign up

693
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and there is a search engine

694
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
where you can sign up

695
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Now, if people are sincere in their intentions, if they are honest, pick up that document.

696
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
If you see that it is written inside that there are some bizarre requirements, do not apply.

697
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That would be a general rule. If it is possible, ask.

698
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Now, if you have an idea that you have already developed, that you have already done,

699
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and you are concerned about that task, ask, but do not go into that task, because it will be more difficult for you to use it.

700
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Those tasks are especially sensitive from the inside.

701
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I do not know, Slovenian developers, if I go to that Facebook group ...

702
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The group that I am afraid of!

703
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It is a large and sometimes toxic group, but I would say so.

704
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
There was a moment when people do not know why they organize hackathons,

705
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
they copy those copyright legal documents because they already have them,

706
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and then, or it is really annoying to look for employees,

707
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and you come to those ethical questions the day before it starts happening, and you have to be careful.

708
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
We can probably explain what the bad results look like.

709
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What is the biggest red flag, I do not know, you probably heard it,

710
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
there was a hackathon that you did not have, and they told you that it was going there, and that's it.

711
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
In general, I hear more reports, less of those with papyrology, and then further reports,

712
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
they do not come to say hello in the morning, even the organizers,

713
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
they break the rules, and then they just walk around the city a little, and that's it.

714
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I do not go to bed, I really do not go to bed,

715
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and then at night I look for someone who wants to work with me,

716
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
if I can help him with something, and give him some advice.

717
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,000
For me, when you let the competitors do what they want to do,

718
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
it hurts my soul, it is something that I do not have to do.

719
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I also hear such stories, that they are packed in suitcases,

720
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and then you have to, I do not know, from various employed members,

721
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
they pick you up, you have such and such a rule,

722
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
including now I drink, so they do not give it back to you,

723
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
at night you can hear it.

724
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
The fact is, let's move forward, I would say,

725
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
maybe in this direction it is not accepted, I am more of an optimist,

726
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the one who organizes it, let's push him a little,

727
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
now you will see through his answers,

728
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
does the person really think, is he sincere, honest,

729
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
or is he like, you know, oh yeah, no,

730
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
but you know how it would be for us now.

731
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
No, look, I always tell them to correct,

732
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
because I also have it with me,

733
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and I tell them, if you do not go, we will change,

734
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
if the candidate develops.

735
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
As far as employment is concerned,

736
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
they also have to have a practical conversation,

737
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
so in the next few days, if not,

738
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
it leads the candidate to some kind of conversation.

739
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Because not in the last hackathons,

740
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
why is it such a good talent pool?

741
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Because everything from Saturday afternoon,

742
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
when we have a kick-off,

743
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
because I always think,

744
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
oh, drama, drama, we do not know what we are solving yet,

745
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
oh, shit, there will be no unicorn yet,

746
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
what now?

747
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
From Saturday afternoon, everyone is still politically correct,

748
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
teams, mentors, everyone is a little nice,

749
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
a little, la, la, la.

750
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And then there was, you know, if they come in,

751
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
they come in, they come in more,

752
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
these are real characters.

753
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And I will not say that only the candidate

754
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
has the potential to be corrected.

755
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But this mandate suits him perfectly,

756
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
because there is management,

757
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
there is management, usually the mentors and the commission

758
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
always come to correct, greet,

759
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and finally listen.

760
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So they have a lot of people to correct,

761
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and in the end, even the candidate can say,

762
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
wait a minute, I have this energy,

763
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and I don't like their approach the most.

764
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So it goes in both directions,

765
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and I practically always promote in both directions,

766
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
for both.

767
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I wasn't on the side of the mandate

768
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and for my understanding,

769
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
everyone had to be happy on Sunday night,

770
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
which is really a pity.

771
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Let us, now,

772
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
now there is a hackathon,

773
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Friday is now 4 o'clock,

774
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
so I think it's your start time

775
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
for this hackathon.

776
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
No, no, we are working on Saturday morning,

777
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
developers are after work, you know,

778
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
at 9 o'clock, and then they call,

779
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
oh, at 9 o'clock, we're going to open in China.

780
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Let us, let us,

781
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
let us,

782
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
through a hackathon,

783
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
which you organize,

784
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
a classic,

785
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
for a bank,

786
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
for a corporation,

787
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
which is slowly moving,

788
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
which is slowly moving,

789
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
to become a tanker.

790
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Now, wait, not that,

791
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Slovenian Railways.

792
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I haven't succeeded with them yet.

793
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I've been there many times,

794
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and I think some of my friends told me,

795
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and I remember, Malala,

796
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
or maybe me, right?

797
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
When the other one is there,

798
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
then it will be different.

799
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I think if we can do it with a hackathon,

800
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
if we do engineering,

801
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
because we also do engineering.

802
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Probably in China, but faster.

803
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Absolutely.

804
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Unfortunately, we start at 9 o'clock in the morning.

805
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Now the question is,

806
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
why do you call?

807
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
In person, in person.

808
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yes, in person or also online,

809
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
around the heart.

810
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Which is practical.

811
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Now, if it's about,

812
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
let's say, more locally,

813
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
then I'll write it down,

814
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
because I don't know if there will be a possibility

815
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
of a hybrid,

816
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
also a day before,

817
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
because people are already a little confused.

818
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We are with Maribor,

819
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
we have to move to Kranj.

820
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But you probably have better results

821
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
if it's live.

822
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean, like that.

823
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's a very interesting game.

824
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Much more effective,

825
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
much more done online.

826
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Really?

827
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And much more fun live.

828
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I can tell you this.

829
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
All my maltreatment,

830
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
we're not going to play it now,

831
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
we have a quiz now,

832
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
you can't listen.

833
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That's how we were at the beginning,

834
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
when we talked about energy,

835
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
which is a real

836
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
day-to-day job,

837
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and you're also...

838
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
My team is watching our interview.

839
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
No, but with a day-to-day job

840
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
as a developer,

841
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
you do a lot of things in a deep focus.

842
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You plan,

843
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you draw, you organize,

844
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and then there's some execution.

845
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And execution is important.

846
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Now, if you have a routine,

847
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to put yourself up,

848
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
on the other hand,

849
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
you have someone who is trying

850
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
to make you feel good.

851
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You're in the beginning,

852
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and in the end you're in the middle.

853
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
In the middle we were like

854
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
this, this, this, this.

855
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
No, we're going to...

856
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Sorry to interrupt you,

857
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but let's go to the next hour.

858
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
At nine o'clock.

859
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yes, at nine o'clock.

860
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
At nine o'clock I start shouting,

861
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and then they tell me,

862
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
first coffee,

863
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and then we start,

864
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
we lift everything

865
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that is still a bit stuck.

866
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Then we listen,

867
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
why is it a hackathon,

868
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the manager then explains

869
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
the details of the challenge,

870
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and what is very important,

871
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
what are all the connections with the challenge,

872
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
they have already tried,

873
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and why it didn't work.

874
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I told him that,

875
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
after one or two hackathons,

876
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
when it happened to us that the manager

877
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
at the end of the week said

878
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
OK, that's fine,

879
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
you're on a hackathon,

880
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
that young people are interested,

881
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and it's OK again,

882
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
but in any case,

883
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
so that no one would say

884
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
why we didn't do it,

885
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
explain what you did and what didn't work,

886
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
why it didn't work,

887
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
so that the competitors get it.

888
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Then we go a little,

889
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and now I've already changed a little,

890
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
because I've already sent a video

891
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
for pre-preparation,

892
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
so that the competitors get it,

893
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
the team gets it,

894
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
then they need to give a fan name,

895
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
because the worst thing is

896
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
if the team is 1, 2, 3, 4,

897
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and then you're Rata Špavla.

898
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Name drop.

899
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
When you see such creativity,

900
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
what a name,

901
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
because today we had hundreds

902
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
in the future,

903
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and all together there were some like that.

904
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You see that people can do it,

905
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and out of the box they will go,

906
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
because what is the purpose of an introductory work?

907
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
To prepare them as much as possible,

908
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and tell them,

909
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
even if every day,

910
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
because a lot of the participants

911
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
at Hackathon are also representatives

912
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
of the company,

913
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and then they are mixed in a group,

914
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
so that they understand

915
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
that this is really something different,

916
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
that not today, the day you say

917
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
it can be done, it can be done,

918
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but that today, the day you say

919
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
it can be done, it can be done.

920
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And then they sing about 12 songs,

921
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
this is a station,

922
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
always very good catering,

923
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and then when he stands there,

924
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
because he is fired,

925
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
because people have different bio-rhythms,

926
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and up to two are left alone,

927
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
because they need a little

928
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
brainstorming,

929
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
then my team,

930
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
what do you need,

931
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
how do we brainstorm,

932
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
how do we get to it,

933
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and then listen to the first

934
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
notes of what would be solved

935
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and give their views.

936
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Mentors should also be prepared.

937
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
In this step, when

938
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
you need push from mentors,

939
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
from your team,

940
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
so that someone comes

941
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
with so much

942
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
ignorance, not the right word,

943
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
but to shock him so much

944
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that he does not know.

945
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In the first mentoring,

946
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
three, four teams,

947
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
what would you do?

948
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Because for two or three hours

949
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
brainstorming is done,

950
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the problem is that you know everything,

951
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you still have to google a little,

952
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
what is, what is not,

953
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
but you know,

954
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
in the end, there is no idea

955
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
even in the evening,

956
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
most of the time it happens

957
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
that in two or three in the morning

958
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
come aha moments,

959
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the night has this magical power,

960
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and then when you try everything live,

961
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
then the teams are already a bit like this,

962
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
again a fun challenge,

963
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
again I hit a little on the shoulder,

964
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
but I had to shame something,

965
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
but we fight so much.

966
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I evaluate what energy

967
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and what would go to the audience.

968
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Now we had, for example,

969
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Jeopardy quiz, we died of laughter,

970
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and so, mathematically,

971
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I could give it to you to see what you know.

972
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I did not know the question,

973
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
but I was very proud,

974
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
because I was waving in the back.

975
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We know that it is not hackathon related,

976
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
directly,

977
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
because it is a little, you know,

978
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
the brains work a little,

979
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
we go up and down,

980
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and so on,

981
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but you know,

982
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
too much of this stress,

983
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
we have nothing yet,

984
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and in this way it is also difficult to get to the solution,

985
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
they need a little,

986
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
then drink for an hour,

987
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
power nap, sleep under the table,

988
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
they go home to sleep,

989
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and we really have to be all night.

990
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It is important to change the whole team.

991
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I do not know, in the morning in Bosnia,

992
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
now we need four more hours of time,

993
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
when we are, oops, overslept,

994
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and we miss it.

995
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
No, when it's too busy,

996
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
you have nothing there.

997
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So, a lot of independent work,

998
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and constant rotation of mentors.

999
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Teams.

1000
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
A few times I mentioned teams.

1001
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
How do you create teams?

1002
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How do you not create teams?

1003
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I do not create them

1004
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
to give the same results.

1005
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Can it be with Lonely Wolf?

1006
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I always ask Lonely Wolf,

1007
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
to get to know him.

1008
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Do you want a team this time?

1009
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Or do you have such limited time capacities

1010
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that you want to be Lonely Wolf?

1011
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
This is the team with Paula.

1012
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yes, this is Paula.

1013
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
At the beginning,

1014
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
as a participant,

1015
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I would like to explain

1016
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
what your goals are.

1017
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Are they goals

1018
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
that you will achieve on your own?

1019
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Are you able to

1020
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
maybe now

1021
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
look for a more business role?

1022
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Have you decided

1023
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
that you will now develop

1024
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
front-end or design?

1025
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's a different role

1026
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
for different goals.

1027
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
People come to me

1028
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
because they have

1029
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
a business idea

1030
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and they would like to validate it.

1031
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Some people also want to present themselves

1032
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
on the handbook.

1033
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I would like to work with them

1034
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and I am interested in what they are.

1035
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Some people come just for fun.

1036
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But creating a team

1037
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
is a very important step.

1038
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Because if you choose a team

1039
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
poorly, you can have problems.

1040
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I dedicate a lot of time to this.

1041
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This means

1042
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that you develop psychological profiles.

1043
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't develop psychological profiles.

1044
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I work in a different style

1045
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
just to show them

1046
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
how to work together optimally.

1047
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But I study a lot

1048
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
what I wrote.

1049
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It is very important to me

1050
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that there are

1051
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
as many different teams

1052
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
with as many different views.

1053
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And if it is possible,

1054
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
depending on the generation,

1055
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I try to bring

1056
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
different generations together.

1057
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because if you bring

1058
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
different generations together,

1059
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
it will take too long

1060
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
for everyone to say

1061
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
their opinion about everything.

1062
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If it doesn't work,

1063
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I go to a very wide

1064
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
generational ladder.

1065
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The only similarities I look for

1066
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
are in the generation.

1067
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Everything else is

1068
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
a developer, a UX,

1069
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
an artist,

1070
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
so that the team has

1071
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
as many different views.

1072
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
As we had last weekend,

1073
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
it was only for producers and engineers

1074
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
who were 50-50 in the team.

1075
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That's it.

1076
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If we have only for developers,

1077
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
then I look again

1078
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
what I wrote.

1079
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
There is a field

1080
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
that I really like.

1081
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This field tells me a lot

1082
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
about why I applied.

1083
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So that I can bring

1084
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
similar motivation together.

1085
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So that I don't have to

1086
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
go job hunting

1087
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
because I know he will hang with mentors.

1088
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And I try

1089
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
to bring them together

1090
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
so that the team

1091
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
will function

1092
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
as fast as possible.

1093
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
One great task

1094
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
at a few of these events

1095
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
was to prepare

1096
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
each team

1097
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
for an employee in the company.

1098
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
If it's a big job,

1099
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
if it's possible.

1100
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And today you have someone

1101
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
who introduced the website

1102
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and you can ask him

1103
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and he goes to look at the data.

1104
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We have already tried this in the company.

1105
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Here you are.

1106
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
No, no, no.

1107
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I will only follow what you said

1108
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
with the question why.

1109
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What are the best guest answers?

1110
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What are the best guest answers?

1111
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There are 4 groups.

1112
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Treasure Hunters

1113
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
because you also have

1114
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Serial Winners.

1115
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Pauli is also doing well.

1116
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
These are the ones who will

1117
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
go looking for awards.

1118
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Some are a bit shy.

1119
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
No, no, no.

1120
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I will go for pizza and thank you for the award.

1121
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
No, no, no.

1122
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
If you come here a lot

1123
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you get to know the system.

1124
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What are the things

1125
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
you need to pay attention to

1126
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
in order to win.

1127
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We have a lot of people

1128
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
who have already won a lot of awards.

1129
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
These are the ones

1130
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
who know how to hack the system.

1131
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
They know how to hack the system.

1132
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
They know how it works.

1133
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But it's also true

1134
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that a few of these

1135
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
have already failed

1136
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
because the real projects

1137
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
are being worked on.

1138
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
They can't hack anymore

1139
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
because it's the end of the project.

1140
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
If I'm not wrong,

1141
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Treasure Hunters

1142
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
come here to test

1143
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
a new challenge

1144
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
to see how far they can go.

1145
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Some of them like to test their own money.

1146
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Are they usually

1147
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
students?

1148
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They are 63 years old.

1149
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You have a lot of time.

1150
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Students

1151
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and pensioners.

1152
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Everyone who has

1153
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
a little time at their disposal.

1154
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
No, everyone who has a will.

1155
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But most of the time

1156
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
they are representatives

1157
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
of startups

1158
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
or students.

1159
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
They are all students.

1160
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Indians.

1161
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Believe it or not,

1162
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
they are all

1163
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
competing

1164
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
with older students.

1165
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
At this point...

1166
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
No, no, no, wait, wait.

1167
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Wait, wait.

1168
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Job hunters?

1169
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Now you two can ask

1170
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
if they like it.

1171
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I will make an EPP at this point.

1172
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Do we have an EPP?

1173
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I forgot the jingle.

1174
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Everyone who listens to us

1175
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
these people

1176
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
support us on Patreon.

1177
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So if you subscribe to Patreon

1178
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
you help us develop this project.

1179
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We also thank

1180
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
the Human Frog company.

1181
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Today we were able to do this project.

1182
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And the Trifas company

1183
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
that supports us.

1184
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And also you who listen to us

1185
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and follow us.

1186
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Subscribe so we can do this project.

1187
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's the EPP.

1188
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I like it.

1189
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We also have a group on LinkedIn.

1190
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
We also have a group on LinkedIn.

1191
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You can subscribe there.

1192
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I mean a group.

1193
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
A page.

1194
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We are on all social channels.

1195
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
On X.

1196
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
On X we are not.

1197
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
No, because someone took the handle.

1198
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Look, Sorči.

1199
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Ogrodje.ca

1200
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and the page where all the links are selected.

1201
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Anyway, that was the EPP.

1202
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I fully support.

1203
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Guys, do it all.

1204
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
If a team does good things,

1205
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
do it all.

1206
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Not because they surprised me today,

1207
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
but because I've known them for a long time

1208
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and I'm a big fan.

1209
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Thank you.

1210
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
We appreciate it.

1211
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
One more thing,

1212
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
because Jobhunter,

1213
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I didn't mention it.

1214
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
They really want

1215
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
to develop.

1216
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Maybe they will win

1217
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
so that they will develop

1218
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
this product with the company.

1219
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
A winner is not necessarily

1220
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
equally inspired by development.

1221
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's the same.

1222
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
That's why I also have in the public image

1223
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
if you want further development for them.

1224
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Because I prepare candidates

1225
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
over the weekend

1226
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
if further development comes.

1227
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I always ask the winners

1228
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
if they are still for it.

1229
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
They say no.

1230
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
This weekend we got it.

1231
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We care about it.

1232
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Another hackathon, another prize.

1233
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It can also be like that.

1234
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They say no, I'm not interested.

1235
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And then I ask the next ones

1236
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
who are the most determined

1237
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and who want it.

1238
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
They say yes.

1239
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And then we go forward

1240
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
with the handbook.

1241
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Winners are not always

1242
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
equally inspired by development.

1243
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You have competitors

1244
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
who are inspired by development.

1245
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Paula managed to do something.

1246
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I would...

1247
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I think that

1248
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
if you optimize everything

1249
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
just to win

1250
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
this prize

1251
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
then you are involved

1252
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
in a bunch of other things.

1253
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I would also

1254
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
ask you

1255
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
what are those things

1256
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
that are

1257
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
the most popular

1258
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in Delegions

1259
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and technical hackathons?

1260
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
They don't wake up in the morning.

1261
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
They come and sleep.

1262
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You see them

1263
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
wearing hoodies

1264
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
to the chin.

1265
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
They have hands like this.

1266
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You know who came.

1267
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
He came in the morning

1268
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
because he had to.

1269
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Let's let him sleep.

1270
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The biggest obstacle

1271
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
is that they don't listen to the handbook.

1272
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We had a team

1273
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
in Benajstik

1274
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
who came in the evening

1275
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and said

1276
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
that the handbook doesn't make sense.

1277
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Respect.

1278
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
The handbook knows

1279
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
what it is made for.

1280
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It was healthy

1281
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
but they still messed it up.

1282
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
If you come to a hackathon

1283
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
for an idea

1284
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
it is out of the box.

1285
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You have to listen to it

1286
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
to see what it really needs.

1287
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
What it is really interested in.

1288
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And here,

1289
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
in the introductory part

1290
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
of the first mentoring,

1291
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
because Delegions are so used

1292
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
to being able to talk

1293
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
to the handbook,

1294
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
we have to know

1295
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
that the corporation that gave the call

1296
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
on Saturday

1297
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
didn't think about it anymore

1298
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
because they thought about it for a long time.

1299
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
The call on Saturday morning

1300
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
lasts for half a year, one year.

1301
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Which means that they really

1302
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
need a solution for this problem.

1303
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
They need a team that decides

1304
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that they really don't have

1305
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
this problem.

1306
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I have a solution for you,

1307
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
don't worry about anything else.

1308
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Until now, thank God,

1309
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
we only had one team

1310
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
in Benajstik

1311
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
who came in the evening

1312
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and said that the handbook doesn't make sense.

1313
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
This is practically

1314
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
one of those

1315
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
where I see that it takes a lot of time

1316
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
for the team to decide

1317
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
that they will be able

1318
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
to transfer the handbook to someone else.

1319
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You won't.

1320
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
If he decides in the morning

1321
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
that this is a big problem,

1322
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
try to solve this big problem.

1323
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I know that you came here

1324
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
to have fun,

1325
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
but it's okay.

1326
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Creators and so on.

1327
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Let me ask you this.

1328
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
What comes next?

1329
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
At the end,

1330
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
slides, pitch,

1331
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
prototype, MVP,

1332
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
package?

1333
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Package, package, package.

1334
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I mean, at the end,

1335
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
how do you package it

1336
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and present it?

1337
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Very real, very direct.

1338
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
At the first five,

1339
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
pitch.

1340
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Because, you know,

1341
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
you can say this, you can say that,

1342
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
and they can see that the mistakes were made.

1343
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What they wanted was told in the pitch.

1344
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That's why it's so important

1345
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
that it's in the fifth minute.

1346
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Then, when we move away,

1347
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
sometimes it happens

1348
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
that it comes suddenly.

1349
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
For me, this is not

1350
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
in the first five

1351
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
the best point.

1352
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
For me, this four is so much better

1353
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
because it has documentation in front of it.

1354
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That's why they give away the documentation.

1355
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
They don't just give the pitch,

1356
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
but also everything they worked on for the weekend.

1357
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Because, at the end,

1358
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
wow, how many times it happens

1359
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
that the first three places

1360
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
are taken for granted.

1361
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You know, we don't have to, we don't know.

1362
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And then again, I'll be like,

1363
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
wow, I swear I won't be paid for this MVP.

1364
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Can I say one more thing?

1365
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Okay, I think I was also there.

1366
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We had a problem

1367
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and there was a whole committee

1368
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
for the trustee Triglav.

1369
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
We couldn't decide between the first three.

1370
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And the committee accepted

1371
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
that we would have twice the first place,

1372
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
twice the second, and twice the third

1373
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
because there were two challenges.

1374
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Hello? Yes!

1375
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
You know, that's when I try to decide.

1376
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's not easy to live in Larež, when the commission comes and says something about the closed door.

1377
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's one thing, and then it starts, what is it for, what is it for, what do we need, what will it be like, what will it be like.

1378
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And with this commission circle, we are practically already talking about the implementation of the event.

1379
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
What can we do in Pondelj?

1380
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:31,000
How, for example, if you are looking for a technical solution, how is this technical action solution playing a role?

1381
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Because you can have a person who did not implement it technically, but how he imagined it, how he talked about it,

1382
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
in which he chose the architecture, he is top.

1383
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
He can win.

1384
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It is not necessary, it is absolutely desired, it absolutely conveys points,

1385
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
but if something like you just said, that the whole structure and that he shows,

1386
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
if I had one, if I could program this a little more today in the team, it would look like this,

1387
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and that the commission ignores, because it really is that the commission ignores what is happening.

1388
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Because what is the purpose of the fact that the competitors show,

1389
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
my tool does this, so that the commission ignores what has already been said.

1390
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Because a lot of times it happens that when we try to train them,

1391
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
the pitch must be really storytelling, really simple to say,

1392
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
because the commission will not understand in the end.

1393
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So I like to say in a plastic way, I do not care which phone is ringing or not,

1394
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
but when I accept it, he must do what I need.

1395
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And in such a way, the commission looks at the solutions of the participants.

1396
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It is the same with startups.

1397
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I am also talking about startups.

1398
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
If you can explain in an easy-peasy way what you did, it does not matter.

1399
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You can sell without it.

1400
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Absolutely.

1401
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And that helps.

1402
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
This display, that you have programmed something, it is very important.

1403
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Now, for example, when we have the New Age AI revolution,

1404
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I have had the opportunity to be in the role of a mentor,

1405
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I do not know, Hackathon, on the DragonHack in Ljubljana.

1406
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Top.

1407
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And the DragonHack team, why?

1408
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Well, they also do competitions here.

1409
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And they also listen to it.

1410
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Then shout out.

1411
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Do we have them?

1412
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Yes.

1413
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Also as competitors on our Hackathon.

1414
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They are top.

1415
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Excellent execution, really top prepared.

1416
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Half a year of preparation.

1417
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And they also win, I'll tell you.

1418
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
They really know.

1419
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1420
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Half a year of preparation, I think it was, if not more,

1421
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
that they organized everything together.

1422
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And you thanked them nicely.

1423
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
When you are in the log, on the other side, on Sunday,

1424
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
when they come and tell you, I do not remember,

1425
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I think there will be, I do not know, 60 teams,

1426
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
five people, or how many there were,

1427
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and they tell you, these are our criteria, these are the pitches,

1428
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
you have an hour to look at it.

1429
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
With a little too.

1430
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And then they will choose someone.

1431
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And then when you find out who is working on the other side,

1432
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
because you also went through a few of those events,

1433
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
you know, it's not easy.

1434
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But when you find out who is working on the other side,

1435
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
because you also went through a few of those events,

1436
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
it's stressful and extremely responsible.

1437
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So it's not an easy task.

1438
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But then you ask yourself again, in that interview,

1439
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
what are the criteria by which we will choose.

1440
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And now we choose the most innovative,

1441
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
how innovative we can definitely talk,

1442
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
whether we will choose the most professional,

1443
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
whether we will choose the most technical,

1444
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
whether we will choose five awards for different things.

1445
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You know what, this is also, in fact,

1446
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
now Dragonhack has a lot of different challenges

1447
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
for different entrants, right?

1448
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
So in that business you can have a little more flexibility

1449
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
what is the same, what will prevail.

1450
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Because here, if there is one entrant,

1451
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
this is what the commission must have clear.

1452
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Either we will finally award the most futuristic,

1453
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
or we will finally award the most realistic for tomorrow's show.

1454
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
But it must be in line with the title of Hackathon.

1455
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
If the title of Hackathon is, we had,

1456
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
for example, the market of the future,

1457
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
then it cannot win something that can be in the market in the future.

1458
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Because it means that we are thinking about something that will happen,

1459
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
and the competitors understood that.

1460
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That's what the commission needs.

1461
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
You said the future,

1462
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
and the competitors have developed futurism,

1463
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
which means we evaluate futurism.

1464
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So the commission must,

1465
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and the mentors must understand what is the title,

1466
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
what is the topic of Hackathon,

1467
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and what will be the criteria, what is that.

1468
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Everything is OK,

1469
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
if tomorrow's implementation is the most necessary.

1470
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We just have to communicate this with the competitors on Saturday.

1471
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So that they understand that their out-of-the-box

1472
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
is not the kind of out-of-the-box

1473
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
that has to go a step forward tomorrow.

1474
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Here is another question,

1475
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
maybe we could go a little further,

1476
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
but how do you limit the set of technologies?

1477
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Do you limit this too?

1478
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Because, for example,

1479
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
as I mentioned before,

1480
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
in the age of AI,

1481
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
whatever you come up with,

1482
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
that pitch deck,

1483
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
you can hire it,

1484
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
or do whatever you want with it.

1485
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
If you have a pitch deck,

1486
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
you can probably determine how long it will take,

1487
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and then it will stop.

1488
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Then you can see quite quickly,

1489
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
is this a real price,

1490
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
will you pay for it or not.

1491
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That's exactly it.

1492
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It's true, isn't it?

1493
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Believe it or not,

1494
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
when we get involved,

1495
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
we see that you are in this world,

1496
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and I am in innovation,

1497
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and so on, and startups,

1498
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
we all live in a bubble,

1499
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
that everyone is using it.

1500
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You will be surprised

1501
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
how little they are using yet.

1502
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
We have already had a group,

1503
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
which included 40 people,

1504
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
two of whom raised their hand

1505
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
to use ChatGPT once a week.

1506
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
We have a bubble,

1507
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
you guys are developing technologies,

1508
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
and you are adopting trends

1509
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
through startups,

1510
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and then you think,

1511
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I am the brightest person

1512
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
in the world,

1513
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and sometimes I think,

1514
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
look, this Saturday I had,

1515
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
we gave a quiz,

1516
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and there was no rule

1517
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
that you can't google us,

1518
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and I thought,

1519
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
who the hell is asking,

1520
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
there was no rule

1521
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
that you can't know us.

1522
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Then there was that,

1523
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
no one had installed it,

1524
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and then you are like,

1525
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
what, you don't have it yet?

1526
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
From Monday on,

1527
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
it will help you a little.

1528
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I think the fact is,

1529
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
that these technologies

1530
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
are not yet so widely known,

1531
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
widely used,

1532
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
that people would adopt them,

1533
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
that they would have to deal with it,

1534
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and we would say,

1535
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
no, we are not working on it yet.

1536
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I think we are a year away

1537
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
from that.

1538
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
But you had,

1539
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
for example,

1540
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Hackatonic,

1541
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
which was a technical partner,

1542
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and Microsoft,

1543
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
which I know was a partner.

1544
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Open Data Hackathon,

1545
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
that's the big initiative of our country,

1546
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
doesn't it have a nice connection

1547
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
with our country?

1548
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's a traditional idea.

1549
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It started in 2018,

1550
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I can tell you who,

1551
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Aleš Vešič.

1552
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I hope he will come,

1553
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
we have already talked.

1554
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Aleš is so passionate about Open Data,

1555
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
that he is for all the other issues.

1556
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And in 2018,

1557
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
at the Ministry of the Interior,

1558
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
for public administration,

1559
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
sorry, pardon,

1560
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
proposed an action

1561
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
that more promotion should be done

1562
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
in Open Data.

1563
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And every year,

1564
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
another ministry is engaged

1565
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
to give a call,

1566
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
to open data,

1567
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and for young people to make

1568
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
technological solutions.

1569
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And this is the only hackathon,

1570
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
where all the competitors

1571
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
in everyday life

1572
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
are technological partners.

1573
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Can we name them?

1574
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I don't know,

1575
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
you will know.

1576
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Microsoft said

1577
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
go wild,

1578
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
this is Azure,

1579
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
what should be used.

1580
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
If you have a technology,

1581
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
and you can say,

1582
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I used 10% of the technology,

1583
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
it doesn't matter.

1584
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
If you have this,

1585
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
this is ours,

1586
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
give it full steam,

1587
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and go.

1588
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
This is such a nice motivation,

1589
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
that you will come to this,

1590
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Open Data.

1591
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Last year we had LAN,

1592
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
it was wonderful.

1593
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
There is a hackathon

1594
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
on Open Data.

1595
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The ministry provides

1596
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
the call and the data.

1597
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The Ministry for Public Administration,

1598
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
now I think it's Digitalization,

1599
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I won't say it,

1600
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
because the Ministry for Public Administration

1601
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and Digitalization,

1602
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
they give awards.

1603
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Matejka,

1604
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
the sponsor,

1605
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
the one who pays for the production,

1606
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
is another corporation.

1607
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
All the technological partners,

1608
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Microsoft said,

1609
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
GDI, Xlab, Comtrade,

1610
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I don't know,

1611
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
it's wonderful to see

1612
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
this cooperation and partnership.

1613
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Last year we had a nice event,

1614
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
we celebrated Demence

1615
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
with Roša.

1616
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
These are the moments

1617
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
when you deal with Open Data,

1618
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
the data,

1619
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
you see how many people

1620
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
are supported by Demence,

1621
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
because they all have one member in the family.

1622
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The most emotional hackathon

1623
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I've ever done in my life.

1624
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
All the organizers,

1625
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
all the technological partners,

1626
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
everyone came up with the idea

1627
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
and said we have it at home.

1628
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
As you say,

1629
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
good things happen.

1630
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The municipality of Kran

1631
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
participated.

1632
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
The question is

1633
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
who will implement it next?

1634
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Of course,

1635
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
they give awards,

1636
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
the minister who has IPCC

1637
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and the famous agreement,

1638
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
but they give the letter

1639
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
that it's OK.

1640
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
But the municipality of Kran

1641
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
was the one

1642
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
that started talking to the competitors

1643
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and started implementing

1644
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
certain solutions,

1645
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
because one of the challenges

1646
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
is that on Open Data

1647
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
all the solutions come to the table.

1648
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Who of you was there?

1649
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Did you work with Paolo?

1650
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yes, I worked with him once.

1651
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
He was on Open Data

1652
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
when he came.

1653
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I got a letter from Japan.

1654
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Bravo to Italy.

1655
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Zoran Janković sent me a letter.

1656
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Nice.

1657
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And a train ride.

1658
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Are you going on a train ride?

1659
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I'm waiting for the right time

1660
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
for you to tell me

1661
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
where the train is.

1662
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Open Data is really nice.

1663
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Open Data is interesting.

1664
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Challenges are great,

1665
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
but it's also interesting

1666
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
that Aleš

1667
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
is the base of open data

1668
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and he's like

1669
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I would like to have

1670
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
this and that.

1671
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
He also says

1672
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
that all data

1673
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
must be publicly available

1674
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
according to a directive.

1675
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It doesn't always mean

1676
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that you have to have Excel,

1677
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
but that you have to have

1678
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
consistent data.

1679
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
He also shows you

1680
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
how to use open data.

1681
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Today you can develop

1682
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
a lot of interesting products

1683
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
if you know where the data is.

1684
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's our duty

1685
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
to emphasize that

1686
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
if you need them,

1687
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
you should tell them.

1688
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
A little bit of criticism.

1689
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
How does the state

1690
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
know

1691
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
how to make

1692
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
these accesses?

1693
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It's not like they tell you

1694
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
that this is FTP

1695
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
where you will get

1696
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
those CSVs,

1697
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
but there are some

1698
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
open API's

1699
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
or

1700
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
the other option is

1701
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
that the state knows

1702
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
how to classify the data

1703
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
so that you can ask

1704
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
what you can do with it.

1705
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Here we have the

1706
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Dump directive.

1707
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
That's why you have Aleš.

1708
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Aleš Veršič,

1709
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
who is a big fan of Dump.

1710
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
A great example of this

1711
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
is Pesek Pesluša.

1712
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Greetings to him.

1713
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
His product

1714
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
AutoLog

1715
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
is from

1716
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
the OpenData archive.

1717
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
They started collecting data

1718
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
in different formats

1719
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and they created

1720
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
the AutoLog product

1721
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
where you type in the address of a big car

1722
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
and you get kilometers of technical

1723
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
overview. If someone

1724
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
reviewed the data on the car

1725
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
you can see exactly who

1726
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
reviewed it.

1727
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
OpenData is used

1728
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
to develop products

1729
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
over OpenData and I think

1730
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
this product is now integrated

1731
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
in AMSS as well.

1732
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Such products are possible

1733
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and there are

1734
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
at least 2-3 similar products

1735
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
for similar development.

1736
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I think that's it.

1737
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You know all the bases.

1738
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You can tell everything.

1739
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
For example,

1740
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
you can see that someone

1741
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
forgot the V8,

1742
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
or they could fix it manually.

1743
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Something needs to be started.

1744
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yes, something needs to be started.

1745
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
This is important.

1746
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
This is the real world.

1747
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
If you work with a company,

1748
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
they will give you everything.

1749
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You have an initiative,

1750
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
you have a channel,

1751
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
you can ask questions,

1752
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
people will help you.

1753
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
This is an additional value.

1754
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You can see the company from the inside.

1755
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
For example, Petrol.

1756
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You wrote a blog.

1757
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yes, that's right.

1758
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Can you say

1759
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
that you forgot?

1760
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
No, I forgot.

1761
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
In the beginning,

1762
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
you were not allowed to say

1763
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
what you were doing.

1764
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I know him.

1765
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I explained everything to him.

1766
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
You told me that one day

1767
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
he made an ad for me.

1768
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
He also wrote a blog.

1769
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
No, that's not right.

1770
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You did a good job.

1771
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
You have to learn PR.

1772
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You are the best.

1773
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
You did a great job.

1774
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
You did a great job.

1775
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We don't have a budget for anything else.

1776
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I wanted to say something about Petrol.

1777
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It was interesting.

1778
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I don't remember

1779
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
if I said it correctly,

1780
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
but we always have

1781
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
a page that comes to Petrol

1782
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
in the office.

1783
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I say 3 minutes.

1784
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Or a minute and a half.

1785
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
We would like to increase that time

1786
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
to 3 minutes because it would mean

1787
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
blah, blah, blah.

1788
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Then you start thinking

1789
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
what could

1790
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
develop in you.

1791
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Are there any other products

1792
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
that would develop in you?

1793
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Is there anyone else who thinks

1794
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
like you do about Petrol?

1795
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Corporate decision-making,

1796
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
corporate design,

1797
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
corporate recruiting,

1798
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
corporate selection of technologies.

1799
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
You can get insights

1800
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
very quickly.

1801
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I think that

1802
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
all corporations

1803
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
or the customer

1804
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
adapts to these steps

1805
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
in time.

1806
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's faster.

1807
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's possible.

1808
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It's interesting.

1809
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
If we do it in two days,

1810
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
in the weekend,

1811
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
then...

1812
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You come to the situation many times.

1813
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Especially if it's a company

1814
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
that is doing it for the first time.

1815
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You already know

1816
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
these things.

1817
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's different.

1818
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
If you say we will do it

1819
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
in the summer,

1820
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
do you have data about it?

1821
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Yes, we can fix it in the second week.

1822
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's the fastest way.

1823
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
But again, it's information.

1824
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Data exists.

1825
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You think about it later.

1826
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It's what we say.

1827
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You can think about it later

1828
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and you will see.

1829
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Plus or minus is OK.

1830
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
You can say in the pitch

1831
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
who has the data and

1832
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
what is the functionality.

1833
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And they understand it.

1834
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
In the beginning.

1835
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
No, they don't understand it.

1836
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
He can say one sentence

1837
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
in which he doesn't know yet.

1838
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I see it as an event.

1839
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But if you are quick,

1840
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
it doesn't end in a week.

1841
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Even if you didn't win.

1842
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Absolutely.

1843
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
First, you meet

1844
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
mentors.

1845
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You meet people

1846
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
who are operative

1847
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
or decision-makers.

1848
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
With whom you can

1849
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
build a network.

1850
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
If you leave the team,

1851
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
you establish a connection

1852
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
with other teams.

1853
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You establish contacts.

1854
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
After,

1855
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
if you say you will develop

1856
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
a new product,

1857
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
why not call the one

1858
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
you established a connection with?

1859
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's important to cooperate.

1860
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So you can

1861
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
benefit from it.

1862
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I've heard about it

1863
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
with Pristop.

1864
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
With that team we go there,

1865
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
we go together,

1866
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
we go to the city,

1867
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
and that's it.

1868
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
You've chosen everything.

1869
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I tried.

1870
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's exactly what he said.

1871
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That's exactly it.

1872
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
On Sunday evening,

1873
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
whatever happens,

1874
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
he has contacts,

1875
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
he knows, he will develop something.

1876
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
But not on a last-minute note

1877
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
with brief young developers

1878
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
to work.

1879
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You know?

1880
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Probably there are such

1881
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
notes.

1882
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
They are fully underrated.

1883
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's it.

1884
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
The eternal topic.

1885
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Everything is also not on those

1886
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Sundays.

1887
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
But now,

1888
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
the paper,

1889
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
the PowerPoint, you have to bring it somewhere.

1890
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
On Sunday evening,

1891
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Hurshka does his debriefing.

1892
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
If you are lucky, you will talk

1893
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
with the handbook.

1894
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
You have to say what are the expectations today.

1895
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Will you be able to bring it today?

1896
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Will it be possible to use this technology today?

1897
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Before that,

1898
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
engineering, business.

1899
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Will it be possible or not?

1900
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
There is also a drawback.

1901
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
If you are a student team,

1902
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
you get such a gag.

1903
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
For fun.

1904
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
A reference

1905
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that you are 20 and

1906
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
such a corporation trusted you.

1907
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I think it's pretty cool.

1908
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Definitely.

1909
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I've noticed

1910
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
that, for example,

1911
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
the number of Slovenian students

1912
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
is much higher

1913
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
than that of students.

1914
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
The population is more like that.

1915
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
In England, for example,

1916
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
the population is much older.

1917
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Younger professionals.

1918
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Maybe they were also

1919
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
more targeted.

1920
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Yes.

1921
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
But it was,

1922
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I don't want to say more serious,

1923
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
because you can't hear it right.

1924
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Yes, yes.

1925
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Business developers

1926
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
and professional designers

1927
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
from those companies.

1928
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Maybe they are targeted differently.

1929
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Maybe we are not so mature yet.

1930
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Or what?

1931
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Can we say

1932
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
that you are a tattoo artist?

1933
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Yes, yes.

1934
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It depends on how much knowledge

1935
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and mileage the customer has.

1936
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
If there is nothing,

1937
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
you can't trust them.

1938
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I think it's important

1939
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
to motivate and engage

1940
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
with all due respect.

1941
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
There are young people

1942
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
who still want to prove themselves

1943
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
in business,

1944
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and there are those

1945
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
who already have a business

1946
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
and come to compete

1947
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
for a contract

1948
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
with someone specific.

1949
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Contractors who work

1950
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
in 2IN and Hackathon

1951
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
and look for jobs

1952
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
in junior and senior hackathons.

1953
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
It has nothing to do with age,

1954
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
but it has more to do

1955
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
with the rank of the hackathon.

1956
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
A contract requires a mileage.

1957
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And you have to know

1958
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
that when you do it,

1959
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
you have to implement it.

1960
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Here, when you go to a junior hackathon,

1961
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
you can make sure

1962
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
that you are up to the task.

1963
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
When you say contract,

1964
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
it goes beyond our capabilities.

1965
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
We didn't quite understand

1966
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
how to implement it.

1967
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
When you work in a senior hackathon,

1968
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
it's not really a question of age.

1969
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It's just about who will start

1970
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
and with what age.

1971
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So you have these approaches.

1972
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I count and I hope

1973
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
that Slovenian contractors

1974
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
of this rank

1975
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
are in the UK.

1976
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
In the UK,

1977
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
we have companies that have been

1978
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
doing this for a long time.

1979
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
In Slovenia and our region,

1980
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
they are even more junior

1981
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
when it comes to hackathons.

1982
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
They have been doing it for a long time

1983
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and they have learned

1984
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
what it means for them.

1985
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
The UK is one of the first

1986
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
in Europe to do it.

1987
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Hackathons came from the US

1988
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
from 2000 years ago.

1989
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
When the first typewriter

1990
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and the Internet became popular,

1991
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
they started doing it.

1992
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It lasted.

1993
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Before that,

1994
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
hardcore developers

1995
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
brought it to business

1996
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
product development.

1997
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It was a trend for us

1998
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
about 5 years ago.

1999
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
In 2017,

2000
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
it was the biggest.

2001
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
In 2017,

2002
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
there were a lot of hackathons.

2003
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I've never heard

2004
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
of such a craze.

2005
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It was a must.

2006
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I'm sure you've heard of it.

2007
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
A lot has changed.

2008
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I'm sure you've seen it.

2009
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
There are still people

2010
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
who say

2011
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
they want to do a hackathon.

2012
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
What do we know about IZIL?

2013
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
We have an app.

2014
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
We've seen the chat GPT.

2015
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
We'd like to use it.

2016
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
We have a health database.

2017
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
If anyone knows.

2018
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
We'd like to do something.

2019
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Is IZIL good?

2020
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
IZIL is good.

2021
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It's a great IZIL.

2022
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
You have new tools.

2023
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You have new technology.

2024
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Domain knowledge is great.

2025
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Do you know

2026
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
what marketing means

2027
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
for a business?

2028
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Organizing for a business?

2029
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Motivating for a business?

2030
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Preparing for a league?

2031
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
In the end,

2032
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
it's all real.

2033
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I'm just saying.

2034
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Be professional about it.

2035
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
It's important

2036
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
to protect people.

2037
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Exactly.

2038
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Not all competitors

2039
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
are as important

2040
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
as a handkerchief.

2041
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
A handkerchief has to understand that.

2042
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Let me tell you.

2043
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
We have to make sure

2044
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
that everyone is happy.

2045
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Not just one side.

2046
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
If you do a hackathon

2047
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
a little too easily.

2048
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
We'll be at the event.

2049
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
All of them are just students.

2050
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Opa, opa, opa, opa.

2051
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
All of them are just students.

2052
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Don't be like that.

2053
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
They are your future participants,

2054
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
your future mentors,

2055
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
your future performers.

2056
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Be respectful.

2057
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Even if they are young,

2058
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
it seems to you that they will

2059
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
transfer everything.

2060
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I would like to apologize.

2061
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Some wisdom.

2062
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Some wisdom.

2063
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
When I was

2064
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
in the mentor's vlog,

2065
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
when I was in the mentor's vlog,

2066
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I saw what people

2067
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
were preparing.

2068
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
If someone tells me

2069
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
that these young people are apathetic,

2070
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
that they don't care about anything,

2071
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
that they only like games,

2072
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
that they only...

2073
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I didn't start with the ones

2074
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
that showed up.

2075
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Simply, you don't know what you're talking about.

2076
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Exactly.

2077
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Don't look at them.

2078
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Don't look at them.

2079
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I agree.

2080
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And when people say

2081
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
that we are not people,

2082
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
that we don't get people.

2083
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Look, there was

2084
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
a lot of young engineers

2085
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
who were full of energy

2086
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
for two or three days.

2087
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
They were developing software,

2088
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
hardware, AI,

2089
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
electronics,

2090
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
everything.

2091
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I think that

2092
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
there is potential.

2093
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Maybe, as you said,

2094
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
there are steps between

2095
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
generations, between views,

2096
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
between companies, between thoughts.

2097
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Between thoughts.

2098
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
If we talk about young people,

2099
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
that's one of the reasons

2100
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
why I'm so loud.

2101
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Because we have a lot of young entrepreneurs.

2102
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
We have some young people here.

2103
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
We old people forget

2104
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
that we were the same

2105
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
with this attitude.

2106
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
For our elders, we were all a bit like

2107
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Oh, you young people,

2108
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
how many times have I heard that.

2109
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Because it's a generational leap.

2110
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It can't be different.

2111
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And I think that today,

2112
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
young people, elders,

2113
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
everyone,

2114
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
the world is developing so fast.

2115
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I think that, sorry,

2116
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
we are in a bubble.

2117
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I wouldn't be so young to say

2118
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
that I would be a dinosaur

2119
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
or a dinosaur, really.

2120
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And give me a chance.

2121
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I'm different.

2122
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I can contribute a lot.

2123
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
They teach us things we don't know.

2124
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
We are their mentors in other areas.

2125
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Not all gamers are apathetic.

2126
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
We, young people,

2127
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
weren't the biggest star

2128
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
of everything our elders imagined.

2129
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Quite the opposite, I would say.

2130
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The only difference is

2131
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
that today,

2132
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I always say,

2133
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
because our elders

2134
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
always do this.

2135
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
We were able to do that.

2136
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And we said a lot of things

2137
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
that we didn't even notice.

2138
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Let's thank each other for that.

2139
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Let's remember

2140
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
what we did.

2141
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Now, social media,

2142
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
schools, education,

2143
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
that's why kids don't come home

2144
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and can't think of a conversation.

2145
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Not that I don't talk to them,

2146
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
but we were called

2147
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
to find out

2148
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
what's going on in our lives.

2149
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Because our mom didn't know everything.

2150
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And what can you do on the next day?

2151
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I didn't look at the Internet

2152
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
for that intelligence.

2153
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Now, it's all like that.

2154
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Eyeballing.

2155
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
That's how it all goes.

2156
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
They are a bit different.

2157
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Let's go back to the challenge.

2158
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
They had to find each other.

2159
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
They had to find each other.

2160
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
They found each other,

2161
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
but they didn't know

2162
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
what to do.

2163
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Young people today

2164
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
have so much knowledge.

2165
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
They are marred with digitalization.

2166
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
You know,

2167
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
when we were born,

2168
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I remember

2169
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
when we had one phone

2170
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
in our apartment

2171
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
and we ran to the door

2172
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and it was locked.

2173
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It's a different world.

2174
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
They can teach us

2175
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
what to do,

2176
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
what not to do.

2177
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
They are different.

2178
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
We were different.

2179
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Our parents were different.

2180
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
We have to realize

2181
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
that it's all good.

2182
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Together we can do

2183
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
amazing things,

2184
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
even though we have

2185
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
13-65 people in our team.

2186
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
It's important to have a will

2187
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and a desire,

2188
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
so we can communicate

2189
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
with each other.

2190
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
If you go into a room

2191
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
and see that there are

2192
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
20 people,

2193
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
what are we going to do with them?

2194
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
They probably have so many

2195
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
smart things to say

2196
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
that you just sit down

2197
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and your mouth falls down.

2198
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Young people are the law.

2199
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
This is the question

2200
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I wanted to ask you before.

2201
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
What kind of feedback

2202
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
do you get

2203
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
when people are sceptical

2204
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
and go into a hackathon?

2205
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
What is the message

2206
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
in this message?

2207
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Maybe it's a product,

2208
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
but how does it affect

2209
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
the whole process

2210
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
in the company?

2211
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Is it a transformation?

2212
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Is it a message

2213
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
that even if we start

2214
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
internal hackathons,

2215
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
if we start people

2216
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
in a way

2217
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that stimulates

2218
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
thinking outside the box,

2219
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
changing teams,

2220
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
giving projects to other teams,

2221
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
let's look at this.

2222
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Are there any positive effects

2223
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
that a hackathon

2224
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
can have?

2225
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Absolutely.

2226
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
That was my aha moment.

2227
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
As soon as I started,

2228
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I was confused.

2229
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Why do people only know me

2230
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
through hackathons?

2231
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But then you embrace it.

2232
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
When you see that

2233
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
without a hackathon,

2234
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
it's hard to get

2235
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
to an aha moment

2236
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
in such a short time.

2237
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
When they see this energy,

2238
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
their employees

2239
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
are in teams and they come

2240
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
and say how crazy it was,

2241
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
young people are crazy,

2242
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
we want this.

2243
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And then you think

2244
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
how to implement it

2245
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
and

2246
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
many times it happens

2247
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
that we put a new approach

2248
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
to solving new projects

2249
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
because we use it

2250
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
for innovation.

2251
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
We let people do

2252
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
what they want

2253
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
without thinking,

2254
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
but if you have an idea,

2255
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
we do internal hackathons.

2256
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
We start with different departments

2257
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
so that one gets

2258
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
a different view,

2259
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
and then they start

2260
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
to understand why

2261
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I struggle with this image.

2262
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
You have been struggling

2263
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
with this image for 20 years,

2264
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and a 20-year-old man

2265
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
didn't ask him why he is struggling.

2266
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
He just works and knows

2267
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
that he is doing well

2268
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
because every hackathon

2269
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
sends him an image.

2270
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Then they get together

2271
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
and talk about

2272
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
what they need.

2273
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
We help them

2274
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
because they can do something

2275
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
and then we start to work.

2276
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
That is why this phase

2277
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
of long-term development

2278
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
with hackathons is very important.

2279
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
What do we do next?

2280
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
We put young people in

2281
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and then,

2282
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
in addition to the development

2283
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
of the product,

2284
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
we add skills of coaching.

2285
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
From solving conflicts

2286
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
to working in a team

2287
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
in the ideal world

2288
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
there is an end result,

2289
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
an MVP who is hired

2290
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
for long-term development

2291
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and someone

2292
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
who shows

2293
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
from the company's interest

2294
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
that he would like to be an intern

2295
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
if he wants to develop

2296
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
the skills to become a system.

2297
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
This goes on.

2298
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
These are all the consequences

2299
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
of hackathons,

2300
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
of which nothing is known.

2301
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
During the weekend

2302
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
a lot of people write

2303
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
how happy they were

2304
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and then they become an intern.

2305
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
This is the magic

2306
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
that happens

2307
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
when the employee

2308
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
wants a little more.

2309
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
A smart employee

2310
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
is driven by this.

2311
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
This PR is just

2312
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
a good side effect.

2313
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
We always

2314
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
explain in advance

2315
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
the benefits.

2316
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
When they see and hear this,

2317
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
they are a little skeptical

2318
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
because they don't know

2319
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
that it is possible with one hackathon.

2320
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
One hackathon?

2321
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Wouldn't it be enough

2322
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
for a couple of months?

2323
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
No, one hackathon is enough.

2324
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Two days.

2325
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You will all think

2326
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
that you have been

2327
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
an intern for two months.

2328
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You are so tense

2329
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and you help so many people

2330
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and you are responsible.

2331
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
They are also skeptical.

2332
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
How is it usually

2333
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
when an employee

2334
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
steps out of the booth

2335
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
and you tell him

2336
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
that there is

2337
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
some kind of engagement

2338
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
that he can enjoy

2339
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
with some resources and people.

2340
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
We don't have these people.

2341
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
We have employees.

2342
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
We don't have to spend so much time

2343
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
waiting for you to come

2344
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
and say that it is all for you.

2345
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Can I

2346
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
to be time cautious

2347
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
upgrade Andraž's question?

2348
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Go ahead.

2349
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't know why

2350
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
we have to orientate

2351
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
over time.

2352
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It is Jan's fourth

2353
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
shoot today and

2354
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
he has to go to bed.

2355
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
He could have put a microphone.

2356
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
No, I am kidding.

2357
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I would upgrade him.

2358
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Considering that today

2359
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
we are at the interagency

2360
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
board meeting.

2361
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It is a meeting about entrepreneurship

2362
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and everything.

2363
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Tell us

2364
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
in this context

2365
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
what do you want

2366
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Slovenian entrepreneurs

2367
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
to be able to do more

2368
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
so that they don't fall asleep.

2369
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Why do they fall asleep?

2370
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Give us that.

2371
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Why do you

2372
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
want to innovate?

2373
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I was hoping

2374
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
that you would bring your gadget

2375
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and show it.

2376
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I don't know if you have it.

2377
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Nokia?

2378
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I don't know if I have it in my backpack.

2379
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I always bring Nokia with me.

2380
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Give us

2381
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
that.

2382
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
What do we want?

2383
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Dignity and freedom.

2384
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I don't know if all companies

2385
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
want something else,

2386
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
but 10% of their time

2387
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
is wasted.

2388
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
If you say

2389
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
that we will do coaching

2390
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and time management,

2391
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
we will find food for thought.

2392
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
We have so much time

2393
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
on our hands

2394
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
that if we can

2395
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
come to a couple of hours

2396
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
a week,

2397
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
you don't know

2398
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
what will happen next.

2399
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Why did we start with Nokia?

2400
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I know it's a bad case.

2401
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
It's bad for us.

2402
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Nokia died,

2403
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
but Nokia had

2404
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
a reputation in the world.

2405
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I didn't think

2406
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
anything could happen to it.

2407
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I'm sorry,

2408
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
95% of the market still works like this.

2409
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Who can't change anything?

2410
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
They didn't understand

2411
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
the speed, development,

2412
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
desire and need of the user.

2413
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
We are changing.

2414
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
The world is changing.

2415
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Young people are becoming buyers.

2416
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Those young people

2417
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
will dictate our products

2418
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
for five years from now.

2419
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
If we get old,

2420
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
everything on paper

2421
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and Excel,

2422
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
it's not up to you.

2423
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Why would anyone still work

2424
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
with these machines and Excel?

2425
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
We need to be patient

2426
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
for a certain percentage of the time

2427
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and try to learn

2428
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
from people

2429
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
where we have problems.

2430
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
We should always

2431
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
work with people with ideas.

2432
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Something happened

2433
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
in a person's history

2434
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
within a corporation.

2435
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
He came once with a proposal,

2436
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
another time,

2437
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
and I told him to do

2438
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
what he was supposed to do.

2439
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
We need to support

2440
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
such people.

2441
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I always say

2442
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
that there are

2443
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
no stupid ideas,

2444
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
no stupid questions,

2445
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
no stupid days.

2446
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
It's all about

2447
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
what will happen next.

2448
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That's how

2449
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
everyone started with innovation.

2450
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
If everyone reduced

2451
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
what exists today

2452
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
and what can't be done,

2453
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
we need to be patient

2454
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
that it's okay

2455
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
to try and fail.

2456
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We need to know

2457
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
that we shouldn't

2458
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
always innovate

2459
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
something disruptive

2460
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
that doesn't exist yet.

2461
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Every company

2462
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
has so many areas

2463
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
that can be uplifted

2464
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
and made a bit more competitive.

2465
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
We need to save time

2466
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and it's often

2467
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
so fast and dynamic

2468
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
that we need to do it.

2469
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
In the past,

2470
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
companies were made

2471
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
for 50, 60, 70 years.

2472
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Today, a company's life cycle

2473
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
can be only 5-7 years.

2474
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Technology and manpower

2475
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
have changed us so much.

2476
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Even the older generation

2477
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
doesn't understand

2478
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
how to fight

2479
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
for things

2480
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
that need to be done.

2481
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You can't watch TV

2482
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
10 years old

2483
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
without pictures

2484
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
for your TV show.

2485
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
You can't.

2486
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
If you think

2487
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
that you don't need it,

2488
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
you're wrong.

2489
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
We need to be

2490
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
very demanding

2491
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
to our users.

2492
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
When we work in our companies,

2493
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
we think that no one

2494
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
is demanding

2495
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
to themselves and their companies.

2496
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
The world is changing.

2497
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Why do banks

2498
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
and hackers

2499
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
work so much?

2500
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
They know that the world

2501
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
is changing so much

2502
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
that they don't know

2503
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
what will happen.

2504
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Look at the young people

2505
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and the revolution.

2506
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
The young people will

2507
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
start a company

2508
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
in two years.

2509
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
We, as a demanding user,

2510
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and the young people

2511
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
who are at their peak.

2512
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
The 30-year-old

2513
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
is already a manager,

2514
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
a millionaire,

2515
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
but he is demanding.

2516
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
He wants things

2517
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to be like this.

2518
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
We need to be a little bit more

2519
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
diligent.

2520
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
We can't be dumb and stupid

2521
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
because it's fun.

2522
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Innovation is created

2523
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
at 4 p.m. on Friday

2524
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
with the same enthusiasm.

2525
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
If someone comes

2526
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
with an idea,

2527
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
first of all,

2528
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
we need to

2529
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
think about

2530
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
how to succeed.

2531
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
We don't have time for that.

2532
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
It has nothing to do with it.

2533
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
We need to change the rhetoric.

2534
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
What should we do?

2535
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
When we adopt this rhetoric

2536
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
on a daily basis,

2537
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
you ask,

2538
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
what else do you have?

2539
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
What if you succeed?

2540
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
What else do you have?

2541
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Let's start this conversation

2542
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
that doesn't hurt.

2543
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
In this way,

2544
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
we prepare our company

2545
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
to have a long future.

2546
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
The world is small today.

2547
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
You work in Austria.

2548
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
A little in Austria,

2549
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
a little in Japan,

2550
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
a little in America.

2551
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
We are lucky

2552
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
that we got

2553
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
somewhere in the world.

2554
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
In the whole world.

2555
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Between Japan and America.

2556
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Andras,

2557
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
the last question.

2558
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Jan,

2559
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
your best shot.

2560
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You always give me

2561
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
the last question

2562
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
because I don't have a question.

2563
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
42.

2564
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Your last answer

2565
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
was a good one.

2566
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
A good conclusion.

2567
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Unless you would like

2568
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
to add something.

2569
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
If we talk about

2570
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
corporate transformation,

2571
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
is it true?

2572
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
We just touched on hackathons.

2573
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
It was there at the beginning.

2574
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Then he said,

2575
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
if we only talk about hackathons,

2576
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
do we have enough?

2577
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I said, yes.

2578
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
If you catch me with time,

2579
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I will say now.

2580
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Do you have enough

2581
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
participants in hackathons?

2582
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Do you have enough companies

2583
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
to organize them?

2584
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
If you are a member of one

2585
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
or another group,

2586
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
where can you find

2587
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
contact to you?

2588
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
On all social networks

2589
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I hit.

2590
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I don't write posts.

2591
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I am often asked

2592
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
to write nice posts.

2593
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Last night

2594
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I replied to her e-mail.

2595
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Should I say it?

2596
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Urska Afna.

2597
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
The complicated part.

2598
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Transformation-lighthouse.com

2599
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Transformati on

2600
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
minus lighthouse

2601
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
H O U S E

2602
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
There will be a link.

2603
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Under the episode description.

2604
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
At this point,

2605
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Urska, thank you very much

2606
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
for taking the time to be here.

2607
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Andraž, thank you.

2608
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Jan, the team, thank you very much

2609
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
for your help.

2610
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Subscribe, give us feedback.

2611
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
See you next time.

2612
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Bye!
