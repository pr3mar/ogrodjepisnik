1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's start with the episode in Grodno again, with the 24th attempt to make a good analysis of technology,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
development, technical culture, everything that is connected here, everything that is balanced.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And today we will try...

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
At first I thought we would talk about some side projects, about how people start their small projects,

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and those projects grow and grow and grow.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And I thought this would be a good start, and then Luka would get in, and then I started looking for who Luka Renko is,

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and what he did, and when I started looking for him, I realized that maybe...

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Especially after you sent me an email, I realized that maybe this is not the best.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My side project is not a side project.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, I went to look at your github, but...

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Anyway, we have prepared together this...

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How do I say this...

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
NIT, and we will try here today to talk a little about how...

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, maybe a little more about bigger projects,

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that we will talk a little about investing in those bigger projects,

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we will talk a little about the technological ecosystem that is needed for this,

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
what else did he add...

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We have some sweet sources.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Of course, we will also talk in the follow-up, but very briefly, because I think...

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In the follow-up, we will talk, we will listen, yes.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, I didn't want to dedicate the whole episode to the follow-up, because I don't have much to say about it.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've already said it five times.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But the rest of what you say is also very impressive,

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and that's why we invited you today, so you can say something.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And yes, we know that today you are selling a ship.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
At the beginning, you told us about the podcast, or about the YouTube video,

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
there is a link to support, where you can support us,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and you will also help us in the future.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You will start with the first question, right?

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, I will.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wait, let me take it out.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Suspense.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Suspense.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now I will be like an old gentleman, who will have a...

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You will be a good businessman.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Wait, I have to correct myself a little, but...

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wait, yes.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Here, as a first...

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's simple, right?

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Luka, how do you see yourself?

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Because when we were preparing for the episode,

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
or when we accepted you,

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you are a man of many images,

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
or when you are at Jadarnica,

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
when you receive various awards on behalf of the community,

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which is building wonderful projects.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But how do you see yourself? Who are you?

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I see myself as someone who has successfully built teams,

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
developed teams.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I did that a few times in my career,

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and I really enjoyed it.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Building teams, building successors,

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
successful managers, new leaders, and so on.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
After Outfit7, I decided that I would not go

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
into that rollercoaster,

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
a scale-up company, once again.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I would not go if there was not a really good idea,

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
which would motivate me to work.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I decided what I would start with.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
One of the tasks was that I wanted to return to the environment

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
in which I grew up.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That is the part where I started investing,

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
where Silicon Garden is being built,

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
where we try to help local startups,

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
especially in the phase where it is the most difficult

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to get capital at the moment.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That is the early stage,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
where the developers are not interested yet.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They do not have the basic validation yet.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We, the locals, know these people better,

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
we know what they are capable of,

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and what results can be achieved.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The other thing I wanted to protect

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
was working with people.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That is why I decided to do coaching.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In a similar way I was working with my manager.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I do it without any methodology.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When I work with a few people,

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have four managers at the moment,

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
out of two companies there are a lot of people

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
who are changing.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I work with them weekly,

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and that is my stick,

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
where I help these people build themselves

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to the next level.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I deal with their challenges,

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
their individuality, and so on.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
One thing I found out is that I was lucky in my career.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I had a few managers who were pen and desk,

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but they were very persistent,

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and they gave me a lot.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I came across some challenges

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
that I did not even think about.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I was an engineer,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I worked in development,

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and through the process I realized

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that I am more interested in other things.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That is how I work.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Can you say that as a single contributor

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you cannot go back as much?

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I worked as a team,

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
so my projects were always team projects,

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
my whole professional life.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They were not one-man jobs

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
from the first project.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I realized that.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
On the other hand,

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you have to take more responsibility,

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and you have to take responsibility for others.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That was one of the things

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
that my first manager, Andrej Kuščar,

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
made me struggle for a year or two.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He said to me,

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you can work for three,

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
but you cannot scale anymore.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have to start helping.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I had no time,

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but I had to do it.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Those were hard lessons

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
that I experienced and changed.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Over time, I realized that other things

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
were also important for me.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I wanted to ask you

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
about investment.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You started talking about management.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is good management in Slovenia

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
something that you can learn

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in college or school,

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
or do you have to have some predispositions?

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Are we good managers in Slovenia?

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Do we have good material to become good managers?

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I think we have good material,

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
as long as we have people who want to learn

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and work on themselves.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Once you become a better manager,

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you can start changing other people.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You can lead and be a good leader.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think we have to realize

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that good management can happen

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in companies with good culture.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You have to have an environment

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
where the culture is good,

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
healthy, open, trustworthy.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's where good management can come in.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can have managers, MBAs,

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
who come in and do hard shots

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
in a certain environment,

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but I believe they are proper leaders

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
in a product company

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that you want to succeed in.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You said that you have to work on yourself.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What do you mean by that?

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You have to realize your own limitations,

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
your own fears,

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
your own subconscious problems

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that limit you in thinking.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You have to realize

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that you can't work with people

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
who are more compatible with you.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
As a manager, you work with different people.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
People have different value systems.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can't work with them,

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
so you have to adjust your communication

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
so that you can replace them.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think all these tasks are important.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you don't start working on yourself

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to adapt to certain limitations,

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
it will be easier for me to work this way.

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When I managed other managers,

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I managed a lot of things.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I noticed this when I wanted to hire someone.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A psychologist who was part of the hiring process

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
for someone I worked with for four years

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
said that he wouldn't fit in our culture.

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I said, how can I not know him?

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He said he was looking for a competitor.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There is a very rough culture in Outfit.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
People expect to fight for their decisions,

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and so on.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He said he was looking for a competitor.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I thought back and said,

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
yes!

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
When I hired him,

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I worked with other managers a lot.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was a micro-manager,

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so I was interested.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I wanted to know what it was like.

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I wasn't delegating responsibilities

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
but I was looking around.

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
People thought I was looking for a competitor.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Suddenly you realize

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that everything is going through your hands.

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I had a similar experience later on.

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I adjusted to these people.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He had a good approach.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He is a leader today.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think he has about 60 people in the company.

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think we can do better than that.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I wouldn't fit into the culture we had.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We have a more technical audience here.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Most of them are developers and engineers.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
To some extent,

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
a lot of people work as juniors or seniors.

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
To some extent,

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
a lot of people work as juniors or seniors.

207
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
At some point,

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
most organizations expect you to become a team leader.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Or a squad leader.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
At some point,

211
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you become a manager.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Then you have to decide

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
if you want to focus on engineering

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
or manage people.

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
At some point, it was the same for you.

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes, it was the same for me.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
At Herman Soft Lab,

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
we struggled a lot.

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
In the beginning,

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
it was easier to have a managerial career.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It was a digital agency company

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
where there were project managers.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It was easier to show responsibility

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
that you have 10 people.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It was easier to show responsibility

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
that you have 10 people.

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Then we managed to reach an agreement

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in the recording system

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that you can become a senior manager

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
or even more.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
At Herman Soft Lab,

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I made my first career to the top engineering level.

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was chief technology for the entire area,

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
but I didn't have a sub-manager.

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I wasn't a team manager.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then I decided

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
that I wanted to do something else

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and I started working as a manager

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
for the entire business unit.

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
for the entire business unit.

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I am responsible for the fact

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
that engineering has to be

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
balanced with management.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In real companies,

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
they have a level of chief,

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
when they are at the level of senior VP.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
In Slovenia,

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
there are not many companies

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that have such a need.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Someone at this level

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
is at the top in the world.

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't have the same expectations

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that everyone has to be at the top.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I see management in many nuances.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We have a lot of

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
imagined thinking

257
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
about what a manager should be like.

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We imagine that we need a manager

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
of this team and what it should be like.

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
People are very different.

261
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They need more things

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and maybe they will not be satisfied

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
only with team management.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think that the organization

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
should adapt to the people it has.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Create a structure that is ideal

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
with the people you have at the moment

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and fulfill these roles.

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A role is a team manager.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
A team manager is a person

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
who cares about his career path,

272
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
his next steps and so on.

273
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
On the other hand,

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
you have other managerial roles.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A technology leader,

276
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
a development leader in a field,

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
on a component, on a back-end, etc.

278
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This person is also a team manager.

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I see it as a role.

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Phew, that was a good warm-up.

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Will you continue?

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We are shocked.

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I mean, are we?

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Talk like a classic manager.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I would like to.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The structure of the company

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
is a bit stupid.

288
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It seems to me that we often copy

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
from a larger environment

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and then try to copy it

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to a smaller environment or to Slovenia.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In the end, we come to the conclusion

293
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
that technologically we all need Kubernetes

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
or the management of some teams.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They are not relevant.

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
My experience is primarily

297
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
in the scale of the company.

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The company grows fast.

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't have myself for a startup.

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If I had a startup,

301
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't know how I would do it.

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I would say that I was the first person

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
who prepared for the next level.

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I worked on a product,

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
a backup product.

306
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I grew from a team of 12 people

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
to 150 people who developed

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and supported the product.

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I didn't have the experience,

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
but I see myself as a scale-up manager.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
In this scale-up mode,

312
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
a lot of companies forgot

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
where they are and why they are successful.

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Do you mean culturally?

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Culturally, yes.

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
When a company grows,

317
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
founders have to delegate.

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
They don't ask themselves

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
what made them successful.

320
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What are the strong values

321
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
they lived by in the first year.

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What do they have to protect from this?

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Can I ask you this?

324
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Our guests before you

325
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
talked a lot about values.

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Can you give us a few values

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
that seem very important to you?

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Give us a few plastic examples.

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What do you mean by values?

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Values mean something

331
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
for the mentality of the company.

332
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let's talk about Outfit7.

333
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We thought about it a lot.

334
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We brainwashed people.

335
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
My experience with HMSoftLab is that

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
on the one hand,

337
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
we are not in the middle.

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
On the other hand,

339
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
we have a very strict culture in certain areas.

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
In my career,

341
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
we have a very strong culture.

342
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We have a very good teamwork.

343
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It was very important for us

344
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
to work well together.

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The team is more than just an individual.

346
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I didn't realize it until I went out.

347
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because it's a different environment.

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
People who went out

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
have a different attitude.

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
In Outfit7, we had specific tasks

351
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that we gave.

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
One of the most important ones was No Limits.

353
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It was a thing that said

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
that we shouldn't limit ourselves.

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We shouldn't limit ourselves in our thinking.

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Because the possibilities are limitless.

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What can we do?

358
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you limit yourself in the beginning,

359
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
your goal becomes low,

360
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and then you are satisfied with it.

361
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
From what I learned,

362
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
you can always go higher.

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can tell you an anecdote.

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
My previous manager always said

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that he didn't like me because I was too ambitious.

366
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I always said, no, you are too ambitious.

367
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
When you see that someone

368
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
gives you the opportunity

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
to go one step further...

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's not a bad word.

371
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You can be unrealistically ambitious

372
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and give people unreal goals.

373
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You can also disappoint them.

374
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Sure, but those goals must be something

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that you want to achieve.

376
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And even if you don't achieve them,

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
you have to ask yourself why.

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They had to be on the reach.

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There were failures.

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But if you don't limit yourself in the beginning,

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
if you don't limit yourself in the beginning,

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
then...

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
For example, we worked on No Limits

384
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and two teams appeared on the project.

385
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
We worked on No Game.

386
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It was a team of 20-40 people.

387
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Then VFX Artist started to doubt something

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and started talking to QA Lead.

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
They started to say,

390
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
if this mechanic still works,

391
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and so on.

392
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
These are doubts, fears.

393
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Art comes to you quickly.

394
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You have to know if it's worth it to work so hard.

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And in that moment,

396
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
we quickly decided to go together

397
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and discuss what worries us.

398
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Why are these doubts?

399
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Why do we think it won't happen?

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's get rid of these fears.

401
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Let's see and discuss.

402
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This is very natural.

403
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
We don't limit our ambitions.

404
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Can I ask you one more question?

405
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I recently talked to some members

406
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and they said that we want to...

407
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Especially big and older organizations

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
have a hard time with innovations.

409
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
One of the reasons they called him

410
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
is because they lost the feeling

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
that you can fail.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It has to be in the culture

413
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that we will try,

414
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and if it doesn't work,

415
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
we will do something else.

416
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Can you tell us how you do it?

417
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Failure is acceptable and we will all learn.

418
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I had big failures on Outfit.

419
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Million-dollar failures.

420
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We invested in a new game mechanic,

421
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
a multiplayer mechanic,

422
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
a new brand, a big launch,

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and it just didn't work.

424
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
For a game that was tested on the internet

425
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
by 200 people, it showed the best engagement.

426
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We haven't had such engagement on any other game.

427
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You get a lot of pressure,

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you get disappointed,

429
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
because of your own feelings.

430
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's hard if it's a failure.

431
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We tried a few more things

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
until we finally trusted the product.

433
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's a big investment,

434
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and you can't believe that someone

435
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
who puts so much energy into it,

436
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
just doesn't accept it.

437
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
On the other hand,

438
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you put it on the side,

439
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
because you need to catch up in 2-3 years.

440
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's your survival.

441
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If you don't succeed in 2-3 years,

442
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
how much freedom do you have

443
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
to maintain your competitiveness?

444
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's like content creation.

445
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
If every episode was like nothing,

446
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I don't know where we would be.

447
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Before we talked about some values,

448
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I always wondered,

449
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I think that my circle of people

450
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and acquaintances,

451
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
we're all technical perfectionists.

452
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We're real, we work on the market,

453
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
we're not academics,

454
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
we still have to work,

455
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
but technical expertise is important to us.

456
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You meet people in your career,

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and they say,

458
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
it's good that you have all that knowledge,

459
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
but try to be as scrappy as possible.

460
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's not 100% good,

461
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
because perfectionists can't be better.

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
80% is something I would do,

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and you say, let's do this.

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Then there are some values,

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
which are more scrappy,

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
but if it doesn't work,

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
how do you look at it?

468
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I think that most start-ups

469
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
are in a scrappy mode.

470
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The faster you can get to a prototype,

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
MVP or whatever,

472
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and get some confirmation,

473
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
some feedback,

474
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
so I was in the same situation.

475
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:13,600
In the beginning, I was thinking about another abstraction layer, just in case, if I were to change the base or something like that.

476
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,440
Then I learned a lot that this would only complicate refactoring in the future.

477
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,920
It would be much easier to change the base and everything around it.

478
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I was very pragmatic about it.

479
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,040
Outfit culture itself was completely scrappy from that point of view.

480
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,000
He is responsible, quick and dirty, make it work.

481
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,480
We will fix it when we succeed, we will fix it on a certain level.

482
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,759
Is it the same when you mentioned scale-up?

483
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Does that mean that when you get to the phase where you realize that you are interested,

484
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
is it then the time to go in that direction?

485
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,439
Yes, I think that's how he called me.

486
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:05,120
When he was alone, we knew each other from high school, because he was still in elementary school.

487
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,839
But when he was 15 years old, I didn't have any contact with him.

488
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,239
Then he pinged me on e-mail, I would like to scale-up a company, etc.

489
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,559
Would you like to come and take over as a VP of Engineering Technologies?

490
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,959
I said to him, I'm not interested.

491
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,959
I said, I'm really into software.

492
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:27,199
I did backup recovery systems, archiving and so on.

493
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,199
What are you, a cat?

494
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,199
First of all, I never played games.

495
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,199
Me neither.

496
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,199
I've never been in that space.

497
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:37,199
I'm just a meme.

498
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:39,199
But I said, let's listen to each other.

499
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:41,199
I'm just interested in the whole story and so on.

500
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:45,760
But he just presented the story to me again.

501
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
The problem is that he has it.

502
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
The company will now have to grow.

503
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
We have to do it at the next level.

504
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
He needs someone who has international experience.

505
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
He has experience in building teams.

506
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
When I came, there were 10 people.

507
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Founders, two animation students, an office manager and so on.

508
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
A very small team.

509
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,759
We knew how to sell.

510
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,759
We knew how to sell the story.

511
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,759
For example, Google App Engine sales.

512
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,759
We had it on the back-end.

513
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,759
It was so well released.

514
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,759
He made a stream for the game again.

515
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,759
It was interesting for me.

516
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,759
To see such a project.

517
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,759
To go a little further.

518
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,759
Actually, I fell on the back-end.

519
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,759
In the final phase.

520
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,759
In that story.

521
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,759
And to go back to international.

522
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,759
I was on some projects that did not develop so quickly.

523
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,759
And I regret it a little.

524
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,759
Will you ask any more questions?

525
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,759
Or try to get more investment in the world?

526
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:53,759
Yes.

527
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,759
I would like to move on.

528
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,759
Because

529
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,759
These things are all very interesting.

530
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,759
Because of our sponsors.

531
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,759
Because they are our contemporaries.

532
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,759
I would like to be younger.

533
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,759
This is definitely very interesting to me.

534
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,759
Time is limited.

535
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,759
We will try to connect everything somehow.

536
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,759
Try to tell us a little more.

537
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,759
What does the other part of your description do?

538
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,759
Coaching investor.

539
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,759
Can you tell us

540
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,759
For laymen.

541
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,759
For beginners.

542
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,759
So that we all understand.

543
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,759
What is this discipline?

544
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,759
What is this investment?

545
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,759
What are we investing in?

546
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,759
When you make an exit.

547
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,759
Slovenia is already

548
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,759
Some IT firm.

549
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,759
Made exits.

550
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,759
Sizable exits.

551
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,759
One thing.

552
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,759
That was probably it.

553
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,759
That I actually had some money.

554
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,759
That I got with the exit.

555
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,759
With which I did not deal.

556
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,759
I was lying on the account and I did not know what.

557
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,759
What.

558
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,759
Now a little gambling.

559
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,760
Then bitcoin.

560
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
I did not deal with it.

561
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
I did not want to trust it.

562
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
I needed an exit from the company.

563
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Also because I started to understand.

564
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
What do I want to do with it.

565
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
So part of the investment.

566
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
For me is also that.

567
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
The funds I made there.

568
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
I incorporate them.

569
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I invest them in some projects that I think are important.

570
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I support some projects that are important.

571
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
And in the final phase.

572
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
I also protect them to some extent.

573
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I do not lose them.

574
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
I assume that looking at your background.

575
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
You also understand them well.

576
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
All right.

577
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I do not.

578
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
My investment is not something that is very close to me.

579
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
I have to say.

580
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
I was also in the investment committee.

581
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Maybe a devil's advocate.

582
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Someone who challenges for devs.

583
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
I could not get the most hype.

584
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
I could not know.

585
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
What is the next trend.

586
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Maybe.

587
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
I have seen some feelings.

588
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
I know very well about the team.

589
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
I know well.

590
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Will the team work together?

591
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Is it complementary?

592
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Do we have the right energy?

593
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
I know that.

594
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
I think it is a good assessment.

595
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
I often look at it.

596
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
The Silicon Garden is a company.

597
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
We are founders.

598
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
We made exits.

599
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
People we worked with.

600
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
When we got some capital.

601
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
We collected together.

602
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Approximately 6 million funds.

603
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
From 25 individuals.

604
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
We started to invest ourselves.

605
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Not everyone works alone.

606
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
We distributed the funds.

607
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
We set up a structure.

608
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
We started to invest in the Slovenian community.

609
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
From our networks.

610
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Slovenians are also auto-innovators.

611
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
We have networks with them.

612
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
And so on.

613
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
To be healthy.

614
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
On the one hand,

615
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
it gave me a sense of what is happening.

616
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
I am not in technology anymore.

617
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
It gives me a lot.

618
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
On the other hand,

619
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
I think that

620
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
we should try to help.

621
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
And in the end,

622
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
we hope to make some good exits.

623
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Some good stories.

624
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Some next outfits.

625
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
And in the end,

626
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
we deserve it.

627
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
The idea is to have a good return.

628
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
My question is

629
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
about

630
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
the investment

631
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
in Silicon Gardens.

632
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
At what stage

633
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
does Silicon Gardens help companies?

634
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Can you briefly tell us

635
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
what are the rounds of investment?

636
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
I think a lot of people don't understand

637
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
how it works.

638
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
It's an exit.

639
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
It doesn't mean you run away from the company.

640
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
You can explain the terminology.

641
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
I'm not the best at explaining it.

642
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Basically,

643
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
it's like this.

644
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
You can create a startup,

645
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
and you invest

646
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
on your own.

647
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
You come to your funds on your own.

648
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
So, I would eat some money,

649
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
and then...

650
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Outfit7 was created

651
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
without any capital.

652
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
It's a company

653
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
that came to its first hit

654
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
with its own funds.

655
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
It's a company

656
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
that came to its first hit

657
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
with its own funds.

658
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
From that point of view,

659
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,760
it's an ideal outcome.

660
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
You create a business

661
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
that has a side.

662
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
It's on the market.

663
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
It has a healthy growth

664
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
in the background.

665
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
You don't need

666
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
daily capital.

667
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Not everyone is in that position.

668
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Not everyone has 300 euros

669
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
to finance half a year,

670
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
or a couple of friends

671
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
to do it.

672
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
In that case,

673
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
you need

674
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
family, friends, and fools.

675
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,760
They are probably the first ones.

676
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Friends, family,

677
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
or something

678
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
like that.

679
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Something from NASA

680
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
for such a gamble.

681
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
You need to invest them.

682
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
They believe in your idea,

683
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
and they give you money

684
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
to do something for them.

685
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
That's the angel round.

686
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
They come in healthy.

687
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
If it's 10 euros,

688
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
if it's 50,

689
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
I don't know.

690
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Then there are

691
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Silicon Gardens

692
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
that are early stage.

693
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Early stage means

694
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
that they are startups

695
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
that don't have a product yet.

696
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
They may have a prototype,

697
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
an idea.

698
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
We invest in people

699
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
that we believe have potential.

700
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Whether the idea is good,

701
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
whether the team is good,

702
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
whether the founders have a drive

703
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
and are strong enough

704
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
to believe in that story.

705
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Whether we know them well,

706
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
because they are former employees

707
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
of our networks,

708
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
and we know exactly what

709
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
these people are capable of.

710
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
You want to support them.

711
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
It's like a lottery ticket

712
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
and you simply give them money.

713
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
We at Silicon Gardens

714
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
invest in startups

715
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
from 100,000 euros

716
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
to half a million.

717
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
We let them invest in one startup

718
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
for half a million.

719
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
We have distributed 6 million funds

720
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
over 5 years.

721
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
We are going into the last year

722
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
and we are preparing a new stock.

723
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
We are planning a 30 million stock

724
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
and we will focus

725
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
on the wider region.

726
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Founders and investors

727
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
from Croatia and Serbia

728
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
would invest in us.

729
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
We want to expand our network.

730
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
But in the same style.

731
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Founders for founders.

732
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
We believe

733
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
that we as founders,

734
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
managers and successful startups

735
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
can help the world

736
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
and feed ourselves.

737
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
I have to ask you

738
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
specifically

739
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
about the audience.

740
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
About the audience.

741
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Easy, you got it wrong.

742
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
You are our fan

743
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
so you probably listened to everything.

744
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
My question is

745
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
what kind of money

746
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
do you transfer

747
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
to the company

748
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
you invest in?

749
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
The most

750
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
is that we can

751
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
help them.

752
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
We have different

753
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
profiles of people

754
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
who can help.

755
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
We have people who are

756
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
really good at

757
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
marketing, e-commerce

758
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
and so on.

759
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
App development

760
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
and on the other hand

761
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
distribution,

762
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
and so on.

763
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
We can help founders.

764
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Can I

765
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
ask you

766
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
one more thing.

767
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Do you get

768
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
paid?

769
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Yes.

770
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Does that mean you add

771
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
someone for the job?

772
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
No, founders are

773
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
like a supervisory board.

774
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
It's more like an advisory board.

775
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
It's someone who prepares

776
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
the company.

777
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
There is always someone

778
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
in charge

779
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
for every startup.

780
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
He prepares the startup.

781
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
And then that person

782
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
calls other investors.

783
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Not only those who work

784
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
in the investment committee.

785
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Can you,

786
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
when you have experience

787
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
in aerospace and so on,

788
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
can you connect with him

789
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
and so on.

790
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Also the network

791
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
is extremely powerful.

792
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Also the experience.

793
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Jugoslav Petković

794
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
who went through the investment rounds

795
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
with TUI Miskladi or

796
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Manta or Outbrain.

797
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
They have experience

798
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
with TUI Miskladi

799
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
and how to prepare for the next round.

800
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
So you need

801
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
a million-dollar investment

802
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
instead of 100,000 euros.

803
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
If we take

804
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
I am

805
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
an ambitious, full eager

806
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
person or I have a small

807
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
team.

808
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Maybe we already have a product.

809
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Maybe we put it on the market,

810
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
we didn't put it on the market.

811
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
For example, let's say we are chosen.

812
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
From 100,000 to

813
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
500,000 euros,

814
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
we often get 5,000,

815
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
if I understand correctly.

816
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
It covers the fact that

817
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
you can

818
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
hire the right person,

819
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
because we are running out of time.

820
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
We put it aside and

821
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
try to move it to a new phase.

822
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
For example,

823
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
in the next phase

824
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
we won't be able to

825
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
exit yet,

826
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
but we can get

827
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
the next round of investment.

828
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Yes, that's right.

829
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
When you

830
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
put the stocks in,

831
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
the stocks need to be

832
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
installed with a timer.

833
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
That needs to be done.

834
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
That's a good question.

835
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Why are there versions 1, 2, 3?

836
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Investors who

837
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
have entered the stock market

838
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
have entered into some conditions.

839
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
These conditions are

840
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
that the stock will receive

841
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
the capital from investors,

842
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
which will be paid

843
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
in 5 years, in some tranches.

844
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
This is when the stock

845
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
needs money,

846
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
or a year in advance.

847
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Let's say

848
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
the stock

849
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
in Silicon Gardens 2

850
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
is installed with a timer

851
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
for 5 years of investment,

852
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
5 years of exit

853
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
or monetization,

854
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
plus 2 years

855
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
of extension

856
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
for start-ups with additional potential,

857
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
or are just about to exit,

858
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
and it would be worth waiting.

859
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
What does this mean in practice?

860
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
If you have

861
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
investors inside,

862
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
if you have

863
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
friends, family and fools,

864
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
they probably won't expect

865
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
to get their money back in 10 years.

866
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Mom will probably be happy

867
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
to have a job.

868
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
And she will be worried

869
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
about those 10 euros.

870
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
If you have

871
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
investors inside,

872
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
they are there

873
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
to have a financial outcome.

874
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
This is why

875
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
they will encourage you

876
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
to stay in the market

877
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
as long as possible.

878
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Ideally,

879
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
with the first investment,

880
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
you are successful.

881
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
How successful can you be

882
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
if you are just struggling?

883
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Maybe one round is enough

884
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
to make you successful in the market.

885
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
You start to have some income.

886
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Maybe you can finance it

887
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
with a small loan.

888
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Maybe it's easier

889
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
to look for investors

890
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
for the next round.

891
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
What does it mean to be a successful investor?

892
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Do you sell the company

893
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
or do you work for a company

894
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
or do you just have

895
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
a constant influx?

896
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
As I said, it depends

897
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
on the time.

898
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
They actually leave the company.

899
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
You can leave it in many ways.

900
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
One way is to go to the stock market

901
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
and get an IPO,

902
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
the initial public offering,

903
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
and leave the stock market.

904
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
You have already sold the company.

905
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Another option is

906
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
to get a new investor

907
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
who has brought

908
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
your startup to a certain level.

909
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
They invest in the company.

910
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
When they invest,

911
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
they give 3 million.

912
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Of these 3 million,

913
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
2 million goes to the company

914
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
for a long-term growth.

915
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
1 million is collected

916
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
by the previous investors.

917
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
That's how it works.

918
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
The previous investors pay.

919
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Yes, they pay.

920
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
If you are under pressure

921
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
from certain circumstances,

922
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
it's a mistake.

923
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
Generally speaking,

924
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
what are the expectations?

925
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
In most startups,

926
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
you expect

927
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
1 out of 10 investments

928
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
to be successful.

929
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
They will do x10

930
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
and you will cover

931
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
everything else.

932
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Then there will be a few startups

933
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
that will succeed,

934
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
x2, x3, x4,

935
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
and some will probably

936
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
go bankrupt.

937
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
You will not be able to return

938
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
the investments.

939
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
You need to calculate

940
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
the numbers.

941
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
You can't invest in stocks with that.

942
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
When you are in a stock market,

943
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
you have to invest in everything.

944
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
You have to have a certain

945
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
return.

946
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
You want a certain return,

947
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
but there is also a risk

948
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
in investing.

949
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
You don't invest in state bonds

950
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
or coins.

951
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
You need to get a new partner

952
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
for every investment.

953
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
If you are a founder,

954
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
you need a new partner.

955
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
They have new knowledge,

956
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
new thinking,

957
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
new appetites,

958
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
and you will have to deal

959
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
with them in the future.

960
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
That means that

961
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
on the roadmap

962
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
or on a plan

963
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
if you want to invest

964
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
in a company,

965
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
you will have an impact.

966
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Definitely.

967
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
If a company takes

968
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
capital from you,

969
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
does that mean

970
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
that they have to propose

971
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
a plan of what to do?

972
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
Do you put it on a roadmap

973
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
or on a projection?

974
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
No, they don't recommend

975
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
any goals.

976
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Some investors

977
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
or even more investors

978
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
in a company

979
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
take the lead role.

980
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
They are more active

981
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
with management

982
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
and founders,

983
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
and others support them.

984
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Otherwise,

985
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
30 years later,

986
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
everyone has their own vision

987
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
of what founders should do.

988
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
You have someone

989
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
who is a lead investor

990
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
and a new round is coming.

991
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Investors in previous rounds

992
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
are very much on the side.

993
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
You are more or less following

994
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
and you expect that those who are new

995
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
will be the ones to take the lead.

996
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
They will be the founders.

997
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
For example,

998
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
we help a lot with product management,

999
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
but when it comes to

1000
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
organizing markets,

1001
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
scaling,

1002
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
and so on,

1003
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
a different company can

1004
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
achieve much more.

1005
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
It has a lot of potential.

1006
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Speaking of investing,

1007
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
we skipped

1008
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
all the questions we had.

1009
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
I would like to ask

1010
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
what happens

1011
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
when a company grows

1012
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
and invests in a market

1013
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
and we don't have an answer.

1014
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Everyone pays.

1015
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Was that a good answer?

1016
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
I think it was good.

1017
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
What interests me more

1018
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
is what Silicon Gardens

1019
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
is looking for.

1020
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
We have a lot of stocks

1021
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
and all of them

1022
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
differ a lot.

1023
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
One thing is definitely

1024
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
regionality and the network.

1025
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
You get to know people

1026
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
you invest in regionally.

1027
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
You don't have a local

1028
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
scout

1029
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
that you put on the

1030
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
website or comment.

1031
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
What are the other things

1032
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
that you invest in?

1033
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
You invest in things

1034
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
that you will get to know.

1035
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
We know software for service,

1036
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
we know app businesses,

1037
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
we know ad tech businesses,

1038
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
we know e-commerce

1039
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
and so on.

1040
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,760
We know brand building

1041
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
in the final phase.

1042
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
You will always have

1043
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
more potential for knowledge

1044
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
and you will see your bias.

1045
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,760
You have to be careful

1046
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,760
not to let that bias overwhelm you.

1047
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
You think you represent it

1048
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
and because you do,

1049
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
it seems more real to you.

1050
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
That is a part of the problem.

1051
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
DNA of the people

1052
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,760
who do the scouts

1053
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
and us on the investment committee

1054
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
is definitely known

1055
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,760
in decision making.

1056
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
You can learn from that.

1057
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
You can learn from those skills

1058
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
and you can't rely on them.

1059
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
You mentioned industry,

1060
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
but on your website

1061
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
it says

1062
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
that you are looking for

1063
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,760
proven market traction.

1064
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
Can you tell us

1065
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
what that means?

1066
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
I can tell you

1067
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
about BirdBuddy.

1068
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
BirdBuddy.

1069
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
I know one of the co-founders,

1070
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
he is a product manager

1071
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
at Outfit.

1072
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
You know what kind of person he is

1073
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
and what you can expect from him.

1074
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
When you came up with that idea,

1075
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
people in France

1076
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
came to us

1077
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
to ask if we would do

1078
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,760
a Kickstarter campaign.

1079
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Kickstarter, Kickstarter,

1080
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
it doesn't sound good.

1081
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,760
But after you showed us

1082
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,760
what you have done,

1083
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
in the sense that

1084
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,760
you made a whole web presence,

1085
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
in the sense that

1086
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
this product already exists,

1087
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
that you got credit cards

1088
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
from people

1089
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
and people already bought it,

1090
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
and you made a campaign

1091
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,760
where you evaluated

1092
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,760
how much the campaign would cost,

1093
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
and that there were paying users

1094
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,760
who gave you a credit card

1095
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
for which you said

1096
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
sorry, we don't have that yet,

1097
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
and you made a cancellation,

1098
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
but you validated

1099
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
that the market exists for that.

1100
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,760
You know,

1101
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
you haven't done anything like that before.

1102
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
You know, it was just an idea

1103
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,760
and it wasn't

1104
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
a photoshopped picture.

1105
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,760
But it's very unimportant.

1106
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
Unimportant with the methodology

1107
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,760
of advertising campaigns

1108
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
on Facebook,

1109
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
how much we will pay for them,

1110
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
what will be the price,

1111
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
and so on.

1112
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
And when someone brings it to you,

1113
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
and you say, hey,

1114
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
let's give them 50-100 euros

1115
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,760
to make a Kickstarter campaign,

1116
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
a good promotion,

1117
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,760
if they worked so hard for this,

1118
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
it's worth supporting.

1119
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,760
And so maybe we invested

1120
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,760
more because of the traction

1121
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
and because it's a lifestyle business.

1122
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,760
It's a good business for some people,

1123
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,760
but it's hard to sell it.

1124
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,760
It's hard to scale it to a certain level

1125
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,760
because we brought it with us

1126
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,760
or with a software,

1127
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,760
or with hardware.

1128
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,760
But they showed

1129
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,760
that they have the idea,

1130
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
and we believed in it.

1131
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,760
We didn't prepare it

1132
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
because of how much they believed

1133
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,760
in the market,

1134
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
in the enthusiasts,

1135
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
and so on.

1136
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,760
And then they proved

1137
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
that it's worth it.

1138
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Maybe we believed in it at the beginning.

1139
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,760
BirdBuddy is an amazing story.

1140
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
I saw

1141
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,760
a real-time feed

1142
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
where you can

1143
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,760
turn on the cameras

1144
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
and they send back the footage,

1145
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
and in real-time you see the birds from all over the world.

1146
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
You can also see

1147
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
other cameras and birds.

1148
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,760
It's really interesting

1149
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
how they managed

1150
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
to create such a global brand.

1151
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,760
It's really fascinating.

1152
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,760
It's the best thing ever.

1153
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
That's an example

1154
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,760
of an atypical startup.

1155
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,640
It is not a typical startup for investing in VC, which has proven its worth over time, but Traction showed you how to do it on paper.

1156
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,120
And they validated it with credit cards.

1157
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:21,440
No, we made a flyer, and there are some enthusiasts on Facebook, they talk a lot about it.

1158
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,959
How many of those cards did you pull? That's the question.

1159
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,320
Now I turned it to the side, so we don't make a mess.

1160
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,320
Homemade water from a pipe, that's not good.

1161
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
That's the stuff we have.

1162
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
The stuff we have.

1163
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:47,279
Here I have two questions, let's go to the last one in this pile.

1164
00:50:47,599 --> 00:51:03,919
Can you tell us what is the biggest difference between the Silicon Gardens and the Slovenian business complex?

1165
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:11,919
Can you tell us that?

1166
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:22,480
I am also the type of person who wants to invest in a lot, so I got involved in the business angels.

1167
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,919
I once went as a trainer to this business complex to get to know it a bit.

1168
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:36,080
The difference I see is what you actually want as a return.

1169
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:43,279
And now, like in the Slovenian business complex, they invest money in the market.

1170
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:52,879
They don't look at the exit as an outcome, they invest money in a certain environment.

1171
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:59,120
I noticed that in this assessment, a lifestyle business is supported very quickly.

1172
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:05,199
The idea is great, but then you ask yourself, what is a lifestyle business?

1173
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,800
That means that you see that this can be done by a founder and two more people will survive.

1174
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
Great.

1175
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,399
And now, if it is supported, two people make a local business out of it,

1176
00:52:18,399 --> 00:52:25,199
they survive, they have a solidly paid service and so on, and a sustainable business, nothing bad.

1177
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,600
For a company, this is not enough.

1178
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,600
And I think that is one of the biggest differences.

1179
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Now, for example, a business company has the idea that if you find a foreign investor,

1180
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,600
they will add a combination.

1181
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
I don't agree with that.

1182
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,600
But everything is a bit oriented in that direction.

1183
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The difference is also in the fact that you invest your own money,

1184
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
or you manage someone else's money.

1185
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
We put our own money in it.

1186
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
When we manage this company, it is an amateur-led company.

1187
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
The first Silicon Garden company, which invested in Flavia, Arpovia and so on,

1188
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
was entirely amateur-oriented.

1189
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:18,399
D.O.O. invested in 10 companies, put them on those tickets,

1190
00:53:18,399 --> 00:53:20,399
and completely unprofessionally...

1191
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:24,399
Do you mean because you were still in school?

1192
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:28,399
I was not healthy at the time, but that was the way they were...

1193
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:30,399
A start-up?

1194
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:32,399
Yes, a start-up.

1195
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:36,399
The two of us went to do a real investment, an alternative investment.

1196
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:42,399
The minimum investment according to the Slovenian legislation was 150,000 euros.

1197
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
You cannot invest in such a company,

1198
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
because you have to be an informed investor.

1199
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,800
This is a guarantee that you do not put people under your wing.

1200
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,800
When someone invests 150,000 euros in something,

1201
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
they know that there can be risks,

1202
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,800
and they can probably survive without those 150,000 euros.

1203
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
When you manage that...

1204
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
For example, as an investment committee,

1205
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
I am aware that I manage my own money,

1206
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
but also from some of my friends,

1207
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,199
and I also have a responsibility for them.

1208
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,200
For example, there are some evaluators.

1209
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,200
You come to KS, evaluate some points,

1210
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
then some are counted,

1211
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
and in the end they get 1 dinar.

1212
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
For some points.

1213
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
There are 5 evaluators,

1214
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
and half of them are...

1215
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
In the last month there were 20.

1216
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Yes.

1217
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,600
In the end, maybe this is not the most potential,

1218
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
but it is a child's system,

1219
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,600
from which people invest.

1220
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,600
It's a little different.

1221
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,600
Public money is not our money,

1222
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
it is our money.

1223
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
I just wanted to...

1224
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
I think it's good that we have it,

1225
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
but it's something else.

1226
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
It is something else,

1227
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
and it is also needed on the market,

1228
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
but it is not completely irreplaceable.

1229
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
I just added an asterisk.

1230
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I also participated a few times

1231
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
as a part of the Slovenian business team,

1232
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
as a mentor.

1233
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
OK, there are different tasks.

1234
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Find out both,

1235
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
if you are in the phase of searching.

1236
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I will just say that at this point.

1237
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Will we have any more questions

1238
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
at this point, Andras?

1239
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
No.

1240
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
We skipped some questions.

1241
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Supporters will know in the future

1242
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
what these three questions are.

1243
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yes.

1244
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,399
I can say it again,

1245
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,399
if you like these personalities,

1246
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,399
and if you want to support

1247
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:42,399
our task,

1248
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:44,399
we will put some links below,

1249
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:46,399
so please support us,

1250
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:48,399
it will help everyone.

1251
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:50,399
We support Slovenians too little

1252
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:52,399
from the things we create,

1253
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:54,399
so I can only support.

1254
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:56,399
Yes, so we all support Tomas.

1255
00:55:56,399 --> 00:55:58,399
Now,

1256
00:55:58,399 --> 00:56:00,399
the next task,

1257
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,399
I have here

1258
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,799
two more tasks,

1259
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,799
and then we will move on.

1260
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,799
Maybe we will talk about the potential

1261
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,799
of technological companies.

1262
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,799
We are trying to

1263
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,799
make this podcast work.

1264
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,799
We asked

1265
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,799
our audience

1266
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,799
for questions,

1267
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,799
and Matej sent us a question.

1268
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,799
Will you read it?

1269
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,799
I will.

1270
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,799
Matej wrote,

1271
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,799
lately we are looking at

1272
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
whether more money is invested

1273
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
in companies whose product

1274
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
is based on information technology.

1275
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
In most cases,

1276
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
we are talking about

1277
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
10 million investments.

1278
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
Many times, companies

1279
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
do not realize

1280
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
the love they have

1281
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
for collecting capital.

1282
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
Do you think

1283
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
in recent years

1284
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,200
we are spending

1285
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,200
too much money

1286
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600
on information technology?

1287
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Yes, of course.

1288
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
The situation has changed a lot

1289
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,600
in recent months,

1290
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
maybe in the last half a year.

1291
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Valuations are different.

1292
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,600
In startups

1293
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
valuations are well known.

1294
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
Before,

1295
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,600
it was easy to estimate

1296
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
1 million,

1297
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
but now

1298
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,600
we will have to show something.

1299
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It is not that easy

1300
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
to get 1 million.

1301
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It has changed a lot.

1302
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And yes,

1303
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
certain companies

1304
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
have a lot of capital

1305
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
that they try to place

1306
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
in the market.

1307
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
EF, which is in different areas

1308
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
in Slovenia, Croatia,

1309
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
EF is the first company

1310
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
in the world,

1311
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
they have funds

1312
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
that they have to reinvest.

1313
00:57:56,399 --> 00:57:58,399
The goal is

1314
00:57:58,399 --> 00:58:00,399
to invest in the market

1315
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:02,399
and to buy

1316
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:04,399
a lot of luck.

1317
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:06,399
Some of them

1318
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,399
will be satisfied.

1319
00:58:08,399 --> 00:58:10,399
How lucky you are,

1320
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:12,399
how well you have decided,

1321
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:14,399
how well you have estimated

1322
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,399
some potentials,

1323
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:18,399
it will be seen

1324
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:20,399
in a few years,

1325
00:58:20,399 --> 00:58:22,399
maybe in 5-10 years.

1326
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:24,399
It is not known

1327
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,799
how many start-ups

1328
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,799
will be pivoted

1329
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,799
in the end.

1330
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,799
If the founders

1331
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,799
are ready

1332
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,799
and have the grit

1333
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,799
to do it.

1334
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,799
Yes,

1335
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,799
some investments surprised me,

1336
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,799
but again,

1337
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,799
I support

1338
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,799
money to be invested.

1339
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,799
You can't estimate

1340
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,799
the price.

1341
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
We were interested

1342
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
in RoboDločar.

1343
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Why did we choose RoboDločar?

1344
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
Maybe it will work out,

1345
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
but I always asked

1346
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
why it turned out so badly,

1347
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
what was wrong with it,

1348
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
what did we learn from it?

1349
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
It is a school,

1350
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
every failure is a school.

1351
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,200
You learn here.

1352
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,200
I think that

1353
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
we can exaggerate

1354
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200
the failure

1355
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,599
and put a label on it

1356
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,599
and it is like that and so on.

1357
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,599
I think that

1358
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,599
you have to be persistent,

1359
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,599
at least you learn from those failures.

1360
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,599
I would like

1361
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,599
to try

1362
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,599
to focus on

1363
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,599
the potential of technological companies.

1364
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,599
We are more interested

1365
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,599
in

1366
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,599
Slovenia's

1367
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,599
technological companies

1368
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,599
or

1369
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,599
companies that

1370
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,599
work in this area,

1371
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,599
competitive or

1372
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,599
European.

1373
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,599
Can

1374
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,599
you tell us

1375
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,599
more about it?

1376
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,599
On a technological level?

1377
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,599
I don't know where

1378
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,599
it could be

1379
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,599
a little better,

1380
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,599
do we need

1381
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,599
more support,

1382
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,599
do we need a different infrastructure,

1383
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,599
where are

1384
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,599
the opportunities

1385
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,599
to make it better?

1386
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,599
We need a better educational system.

1387
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,599
Do we need a better educational system?

1388
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,599
If we

1389
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,599
compare us

1390
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,599
to Silicon Valley,

1391
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,599
I lived there

1392
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,599
for a few months in 1992

1393
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,599
and my family and I

1394
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,599
were there for a year.

1395
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,599
If I look at

1396
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,599
the situation there

1397
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,599
or here,

1398
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,599
we are not there yet.

1399
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,599
You can imagine

1400
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,599
that Silicon Valley

1401
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,599
started with Hewlett-Packard,

1402
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,599
Intel,

1403
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,599
microprocessors,

1404
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,599
and that drove

1405
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,599
the next start-ups.

1406
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,599
Those people then

1407
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,599
invested and created

1408
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,599
the next companies.

1409
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,599
It is the 20th generation

1410
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,599
of those companies

1411
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,599
and I think we are

1412
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,599
on the 1st or 2nd generation.

1413
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,599
We are not there yet.

1414
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,599
There are no stories yet.

1415
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,599
I can tell you that

1416
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,599
if I look at

1417
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,599
the software industry,

1418
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,599
which was the biggest IT company

1419
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,599
for many years,

1420
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,599
a successful story came out of it.

1421
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,599
I can say that

1422
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,599
a story came out of it.

1423
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,599
Click, Sportradar,

1424
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,599
a story came out.

1425
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,599
Investing in Slovenia

1426
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,599
was 150 million in the last period.

1427
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,599
It came out of it.

1428
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,599
So,

1429
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,599
the next generations

1430
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,599
are already here.

1431
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,599
We need to encourage the environment.

1432
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,599
I think it is better

1433
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,599
if those people who created Exit

1434
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,599
invest in the environment

1435
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,599
because it is hard on the one hand.

1436
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,599
It is hard to go back.

1437
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,599
There is also

1438
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,599
an investment mode

1439
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,599
where you have to grow.

1440
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,599
It is not something you have done before

1441
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,599
and you can get used to it.

1442
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,599
It is not simple.

1443
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,599
We are not all for that.

1444
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,599
Not everyone who has capital

1445
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,599
will naturally

1446
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,599
want to do that.

1447
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,599
You want more than that.

1448
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,599
Everything goes into some

1449
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,599
impermanence and so on.

1450
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,599
I also invest in

1451
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,599
the decision of impermanence.

1452
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,599
It is part of

1453
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,599
preserving some values

1454
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,599
for a long time.

1455
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,599
You don't have to think about it.

1456
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,599
I am

1457
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,599
from the audience

1458
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,599
again.

1459
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,599
Draž says

1460
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,599
you are a passionate supporter

1461
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,599
of the inhabitants.

1462
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,599
One of the new topics

1463
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,599
is the Technological Forum of Slovenia.

1464
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,599
I forgot about that.

1465
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,599
Can you tell us

1466
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,599
where will

1467
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,599
that forum be?

1468
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,599
Is it a topic

1469
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,599
where we will get

1470
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,599
a more connected

1471
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,599
community?

1472
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,599
Why is that?

1473
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,599
It is still

1474
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,599
planned

1475
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,599
to launch

1476
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,599
somewhere in May.

1477
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,599
Publicity and so on.

1478
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,599
We established

1479
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,599
an economic interest association.

1480
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,599
It is a formal form.

1481
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,599
The Slovenian Technological Forum.

1482
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,599
We are waiting for the government

1483
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,599
to confirm the use of the word

1484
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,599
Slovenian.

1485
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,599
We haven't got it yet.

1486
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,599
We are a technological forum.

1487
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,599
The idea is

1488
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,599
that we have been listening

1489
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,599
for many years.

1490
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,599
Many of the entrepreneurs

1491
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,599
who tried to do something

1492
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,599
changed the environment

1493
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,599
and adapted to the environment

1494
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,599
of the technological sector.

1495
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,599
They worked hard

1496
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,599
and got a lot of information

1497
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,599
about the company.

1498
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,599
I am a representative

1499
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,599
and so on.

1500
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,599
Marcik also tried

1501
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,599
different associations

1502
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,599
and an economic forum

1503
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,599
and so on.

1504
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,599
They were unsuccessful.

1505
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,599
In the last year and a half

1506
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,599
there were

1507
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,599
17 companies

1508
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,599
who joined us.

1509
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,599
We said

1510
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,599
that we will give

1511
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
20,000 euros

1512
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,599
for this project.

1513
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,599
We believe

1514
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,599
that we will put our money

1515
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,599
into it.

1516
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,599
We will create

1517
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,599
an association

1518
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,599
that will try

1519
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,599
to place

1520
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,599
an agenda

1521
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,599
in the public.

1522
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,599
We will lobby politicians

1523
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,599
and try to persuade

1524
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,599
the public and politicians

1525
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,599
to start

1526
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,599
working.

1527
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,599
I think

1528
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,599
we will have to

1529
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,599
create a vision

1530
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,599
of what Slovenia should be.

1531
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,599
A strategic plan.

1532
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,599
No, not a strategic plan.

1533
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,599
A vision.

1534
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,599
What do we want to be in 10 years?

1535
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,599
A less defined,

1536
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,599
but a starting point.

1537
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,599
Something that

1538
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,599
the society would accept.

1539
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,599
This is not

1540
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,599
just something

1541
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,599
for the environment,

1542
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,599
it is everything.

1543
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,599
The technological sector

1544
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,599
must be successful

1545
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,599
if we do not improve education.

1546
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,599
If the environment

1547
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,599
is not open

1548
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,599
to the migration

1549
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,599
of immigrants

1550
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,599
and their families.

1551
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,599
We need a lot of

1552
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,599
initiatives.

1553
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,599
Silicon Gardens

1554
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,599
is one of the members.

1555
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,599
We see that

1556
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,599
if we invest in the Slovenian sector,

1557
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,599
in the next round,

1558
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,599
this sector will move

1559
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,599
to Delaware, London,

1560
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,599
or somewhere else,

1561
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,599
because a venture capitalist

1562
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,599
from Silicon Valley

1563
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,599
will not come to a notary

1564
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,599
in Slovenia with a power of attorney

1565
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,599
where he will be able

1566
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,599
to invest.

1567
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,599
No way.

1568
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,599
This is

1569
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,599
a problem

1570
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,599
that he will not solve.

1571
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,599
There are some problems

1572
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,599
that can be solved

1573
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,599
with low-hanging fruit.

1574
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,599
There are also problems

1575
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,599
that need to be imagined

1576
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,599
as a vision,

1577
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,599
to start believing

1578
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,599
that something can be done.

1579
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,599
I believe in politics

1580
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,599
as a vision.

1581
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,599
If we look back

1582
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,599
while I was preparing

1583
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,599
politics

1584
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,599
before independence

1585
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,599
and so on,

1586
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,599
we had a vision

1587
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,599
of an independent state,

1588
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,599
we had a vision

1589
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,599
of the European Union,

1590
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,599
we had a vision of the euro,

1591
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,599
and the whole society

1592
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,599
was working to achieve it.

1593
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,599
A lot of things

1594
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,599
had to be adapted

1595
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,599
to achieve it.

1596
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,599
Now we are moving

1597
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,599
without any vision.

1598
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,599
We are talking about

1599
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,599
a bit of tourism,

1600
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,599
a bit of dark metal,

1601
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,599
a bit of aquaponics.

1602
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,599
My question is

1603
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,599
related to that.

1604
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,599
What kind of infrastructure

1605
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,599
is really important,

1606
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,599
purely plastic,

1607
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,599
what kind of infrastructure

1608
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,599
is needed for this kind of

1609
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,599
tasks?

1610
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,599
Sometimes they say

1611
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,599
you need a railway,

1612
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,599
you need a highway.

1613
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,599
Where do you see

1614
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,599
this basic

1615
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,599
base layer

1616
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,599
that is really needed?

1617
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,599
I am a big advocate

1618
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:19,599
that education is

1619
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:21,599
one of the big tasks.

1620
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,599
I am not talking about

1621
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,599
the vehement digitization

1622
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:27,599
and so on.

1623
01:08:27,599 --> 01:08:29,599
This aspect seems important to me,

1624
01:08:29,599 --> 01:08:31,599
but it seems more important

1625
01:08:31,599 --> 01:08:33,599
that the next generation

1626
01:08:33,599 --> 01:08:35,599
that comes out

1627
01:08:35,599 --> 01:08:37,599
of the school system

1628
01:08:37,599 --> 01:08:39,599
would experience

1629
01:08:39,599 --> 01:08:41,599
more things,

1630
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,599
more cooperation and so on.

1631
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:45,599
Today, the school is very competitive

1632
01:08:45,599 --> 01:08:47,599
in terms of individualized

1633
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:49,599
assessments and some fight

1634
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:51,599
for that.

1635
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,599
You have to create

1636
01:08:53,599 --> 01:08:55,599
a foundation for cooperation

1637
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:57,599
and so on.

1638
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:59,599
Education seems to me

1639
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:01,599
to be one of the key tasks.

1640
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:03,599
When I say

1641
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:05,599
digitization,

1642
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:07,599
I mean that

1643
01:09:07,599 --> 01:09:09,599
if you look at Nobel Prizes

1644
01:09:09,599 --> 01:09:11,599
most of the awards

1645
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:13,599
were awarded

1646
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,599
in different fields

1647
01:09:15,599 --> 01:09:17,599
for achievements

1648
01:09:17,599 --> 01:09:19,599
that were effective

1649
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:21,599
due to the use

1650
01:09:21,599 --> 01:09:23,599
of data

1651
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:25,599
and information technologies

1652
01:09:25,599 --> 01:09:27,599
that enabled

1653
01:09:27,599 --> 01:09:29,599
breakthroughs.

1654
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,599
Today,

1655
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,599
chemists, physicists,

1656
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:35,599
everyone needs

1657
01:09:35,599 --> 01:09:37,599
to be literate

1658
01:09:37,599 --> 01:09:39,599
in digital sciences

1659
01:09:39,599 --> 01:09:41,599
a long time ago.

1660
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:43,599
If we don't use

1661
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:45,599
these talents of young children,

1662
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,599
we probably won't

1663
01:09:47,599 --> 01:09:49,599
be able to go to Bangalore.

1664
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:51,599
I was lucky

1665
01:09:51,599 --> 01:09:53,599
when I was in school.

1666
01:09:53,599 --> 01:09:55,599
I had a math teacher

1667
01:09:55,599 --> 01:09:57,599
who opened my eyes.

1668
01:09:57,599 --> 01:09:59,599
He was really good

1669
01:09:59,599 --> 01:10:01,599
at computer science

1670
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:03,599
at the Kran High School.

1671
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,599
He was led by a teacher.

1672
01:10:05,599 --> 01:10:07,599
I think we need more of that.

1673
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:09,599
That's one thing.

1674
01:10:09,599 --> 01:10:11,599
The other is bureaucratic trust.

1675
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:13,599
Bureaucratic trust is nonsense.

1676
01:10:13,599 --> 01:10:15,599
When you say

1677
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:17,599
this is trust,

1678
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,599
can we send it?

1679
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:21,599
We don't have it in the company.

1680
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:23,599
If there is a trust,

1681
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:25,599
where can you send it?

1682
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:27,599
Someone set it up.

1683
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,599
What is the solution?

1684
01:10:29,599 --> 01:10:31,599
How can we remove this trust?

1685
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:33,599
This is where

1686
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:35,599
the journalist's

1687
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,599
inexperience comes in.

1688
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:39,599
Maybe the journalists would

1689
01:10:39,599 --> 01:10:41,599
do better.

1690
01:10:43,599 --> 01:10:45,599
There is a quote.

1691
01:10:45,599 --> 01:10:47,599
If you want to make enemies,

1692
01:10:47,599 --> 01:10:49,599
try to change something.

1693
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,599
It sounds like an uphill battle.

1694
01:10:51,599 --> 01:10:53,599
Yes.

1695
01:10:53,599 --> 01:10:55,599
I agree.

1696
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,599
We also think

1697
01:10:57,599 --> 01:10:59,599
a lot

1698
01:10:59,599 --> 01:11:01,599
about how

1699
01:11:01,599 --> 01:11:03,599
we will be able to communicate

1700
01:11:03,599 --> 01:11:05,599
this information.

1701
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,599
If you try to change something,

1702
01:11:07,599 --> 01:11:09,599
it's a disaster.

1703
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,599
I think we need a new vision.

1704
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:13,599
We need to imagine

1705
01:11:13,599 --> 01:11:15,599
a better future.

1706
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:17,599
Why?

1707
01:11:17,599 --> 01:11:19,599
And then we hope to

1708
01:11:19,599 --> 01:11:21,599
talk about it.

1709
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,599
A good example

1710
01:11:23,599 --> 01:11:25,599
is Digital Serbia.

1711
01:11:25,599 --> 01:11:27,599
They are an IT company.

1712
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:29,599
Serbia is in a different situation.

1713
01:11:29,599 --> 01:11:31,599
The success rate is too good.

1714
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:33,599
We tolerate everything.

1715
01:11:33,599 --> 01:11:35,599
It's not bad enough yet.

1716
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:37,599
It's good.

1717
01:11:37,599 --> 01:11:39,599
When you are in a worse situation,

1718
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:41,599
it's easier to grow.

1719
01:11:41,599 --> 01:11:43,599
They launched

1720
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,599
a voice

1721
01:11:45,599 --> 01:11:47,599
where they said,

1722
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,599
I'm learning Python at school.

1723
01:11:49,599 --> 01:11:51,599
That was the vision.

1724
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,599
Then they came to this.

1725
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,599
They started

1726
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:57,599
programming based on

1727
01:11:57,599 --> 01:11:59,599
Word and writing.

1728
01:12:01,599 --> 01:12:03,599
It's a creative work.

1729
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:05,599
It's a creative creation.

1730
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:07,599
They do it

1731
01:12:07,599 --> 01:12:09,599
with students,

1732
01:12:09,599 --> 01:12:11,599
students and so on.

1733
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:15,599
You continue.

1734
01:12:15,599 --> 01:12:17,599
When we were preparing,

1735
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,599
we thought a lot.

1736
01:12:19,599 --> 01:12:21,599
I'm an investor.

1737
01:12:23,599 --> 01:12:25,599
We have certain problems

1738
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,599
with law

1739
01:12:27,599 --> 01:12:29,599
or with

1740
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,599
not so modern

1741
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:33,599
legislation.

1742
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,599
We thought,

1743
01:12:35,599 --> 01:12:37,599
what does it look like in Slovenia

1744
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:39,599
if you want to make a business

1745
01:12:39,599 --> 01:12:41,599
for employees?

1746
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:43,599
When I listen to it,

1747
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:45,599
I feel like

1748
01:12:45,599 --> 01:12:47,599
we are at a point

1749
01:12:47,599 --> 01:12:49,599
where

1750
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:51,599
the legislation

1751
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:53,599
states that certain institutions

1752
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:55,599
wrote their own laws

1753
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:57,599
and proposed them.

1754
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,599
Maybe it helped

1755
01:12:59,599 --> 01:13:01,599
to change the law.

1756
01:13:01,599 --> 01:13:03,599
I'm talking about

1757
01:13:03,599 --> 01:13:05,599
the evolution

1758
01:13:05,599 --> 01:13:07,599
of diseases.

1759
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:11,599
How do you see

1760
01:13:11,599 --> 01:13:13,599
this topic

1761
01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:15,599
of employee capital?

1762
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,599
We are working on it.

1763
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:19,599
There will be steps in lobbying.

1764
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:21,599
Lobbying has mixed feelings.

1765
01:13:21,599 --> 01:13:23,599
In Slovenia,

1766
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,599
it's a taboo.

1767
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:27,599
I don't think

1768
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:29,599
it should be.

1769
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,599
It depends on the person

1770
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:33,599
who does it and the way you do it.

1771
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:37,599
I don't think it's the best

1772
01:13:37,599 --> 01:13:39,599
if laws

1773
01:13:39,599 --> 01:13:41,599
come out of the blue

1774
01:13:41,599 --> 01:13:43,599
and are proposed.

1775
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:45,599
I think the parliament

1776
01:13:45,599 --> 01:13:47,599
has to do its job.

1777
01:13:47,599 --> 01:13:49,599
They are paid

1778
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:51,599
to do their job.

1779
01:13:53,599 --> 01:13:55,599
I don't want this.

1780
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,599
On the other hand,

1781
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:01,599
if you want to change something,

1782
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,599
you have to show the way.

1783
01:14:03,599 --> 01:14:05,599
There are different ways.

1784
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:07,599
How do you solve

1785
01:14:07,599 --> 01:14:09,599
the problem of

1786
01:14:09,599 --> 01:14:11,599
giving a startup

1787
01:14:11,599 --> 01:14:13,599
and making it profitable?

1788
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,599
The biggest problem

1789
01:14:15,599 --> 01:14:17,599
is that people

1790
01:14:17,599 --> 01:14:19,599
don't buy it.

1791
01:14:19,599 --> 01:14:21,599
If they buy it for nominal value,

1792
01:14:21,599 --> 01:14:23,599
they will pay

1793
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:25,599
in cash.

1794
01:14:25,599 --> 01:14:27,599
More than you plan to invest.

1795
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:29,599
That's exactly what's happening.

1796
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:31,599
People are looking for a way

1797
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:33,599
to do it.

1798
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,599
They establish a company

1799
01:14:35,599 --> 01:14:37,599
and that company invests.

1800
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,599
It's hidden behind a holding company.

1801
01:14:39,599 --> 01:14:41,599
Slovenia or anywhere else.

1802
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:43,599
It's transparent

1803
01:14:43,599 --> 01:14:45,599
but it's not treated

1804
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:47,599
as a source of income.

1805
01:14:47,599 --> 01:14:49,599
Or, I don't know,

1806
01:14:49,599 --> 01:14:51,599
in the end,

1807
01:14:51,599 --> 01:14:53,599
the Industrial Democracy Institute

1808
01:14:53,599 --> 01:14:55,599
adopts the ESOP model

1809
01:14:55,599 --> 01:14:57,599
which is a company

1810
01:14:57,599 --> 01:14:59,599
as a part of the system.

1811
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I would like to see it as something that cannot be picked up by a large number of people.

1812
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
On the other hand, there is a great potential that people who are involved in some great stories

1813
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
will gain some added value and then pay a capital gain.

1814
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And in the end, the money, the people who are here, in Slovenia, who are working here,

1815
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
creating a family and so on, will probably be used by the majority here in the final phase,

1816
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
and not invested.

1817
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Are we, as a society, aware that we live in such a global world,

1818
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
so that capital can jump quickly, but we are too little?

1819
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Too little, too little.

1820
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Do things happen quickly, or do we get confused because we are not aware of it?

1821
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I don't know if we are not aware of it, but I think it's a priority.

1822
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
We are a typical example of status quo.

1823
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Why would I change anything? It's just a part of it.

1824
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It's not that bad.

1825
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I think that's the main problem.

1826
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Are we going to eat now, or are we going to ask some followers?

1827
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Because he's been struggling with it.

1828
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
We can't eat here if we don't ask some followers.

1829
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:42,000
We'll sort it out. I think we have one more message from the audience.

1830
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Yes, we can sort it out.

1831
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
You have it in front of you. Please, do it.

1832
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
You can make a drink of water if we need it.

1833
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Or a top dog.

1834
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Did you find it?

1835
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Yes, I did.

1836
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Majalko asked a question about technology.

1837
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I believe you have it very respected.

1838
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Luka leads a huge team of volunteers,

1839
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
where he has created a trailer during the pandemic.

1840
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
He has a question about soft skills,

1841
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
and how he came up with the organization of the work at the same time.

1842
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I believe that technology is not the most demanding thing in all these projects,

1843
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
but how do you organize a group of volunteers?

1844
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It's like herding the cats.

1845
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yes, it's very different.

1846
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I was lucky enough to experience it myself.

1847
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I was in Ubuntu and KDE community for 4 years,

1848
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and I was very active.

1849
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I saw it there.

1850
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I saw the Ubuntu canonical, Ubuntu community,

1851
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
and the aspect of mixing it.

1852
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Problems that arise there,

1853
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
and that's where I tried to solve them.

1854
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
In Ubuntu community, which we had at KDE,

1855
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
and I learned a lot there.

1856
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I saw that things are different there.

1857
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's not like in a company,

1858
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
where you make a top-level decision,

1859
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
and then it's done.

1860
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Community and meritocracy are the best types.

1861
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
What you do, you do.

1862
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
If you do something good,

1863
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
you'll be on the right track,

1864
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and you'll keep doing it.

1865
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
The advantage of being an investigator during COVID

1866
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
was that, on the one hand,

1867
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
you could stay at home,

1868
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
work from home,

1869
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
and on the other hand,

1870
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
there were some smart people.

1871
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
They were worried about what would happen,

1872
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and they said,

1873
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
this seems more important to me

1874
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
than what I do in the office.

1875
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
We had a few people

1876
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
who were on the other side,

1877
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
because we were so engaged,

1878
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
and interested,

1879
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
that we changed the priorities.

1880
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
In the beginning, it was very simple,

1881
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
because people were very engaged.

1882
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I didn't change the plan,

1883
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I just put together my Excel table,

1884
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
and that was it.

1885
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Then it all came together.

1886
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I said, let's not do it again,

1887
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
and it happened overnight.

1888
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I was a comfortable person,

1889
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
and when I fell asleep,

1890
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
in the 10th grade,

1891
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
it was dark again,

1892
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
and I said, wow,

1893
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
yesterday I said let's not do it,

1894
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
and now this.

1895
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
You don't need a lot,

1896
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
because the environment is such

1897
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
that people are people.

1898
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
There were people from the academic sphere,

1899
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
who first tasted

1900
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
what it is like in an entrepreneurial environment.

1901
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
We had a more entrepreneurial culture,

1902
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
a more mentality,

1903
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
because there were a lot of developers,

1904
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
IT people, product managers,

1905
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
who were from such agile companies.

1906
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And there were people from the academic world,

1907
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
professors from different faculties,

1908
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
scientists,

1909
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and they first tasted

1910
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
what fast-paced moving was like,

1911
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
and they enjoyed it.

1912
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Because they were used to doing

1913
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
big tasks,

1914
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and it was impossible for them.

1915
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Now they are all over the country,

1916
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
and there is no funding,

1917
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
and there was a can-do mentality.

1918
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It was very simple.

1919
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Then later,

1920
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
the motivation,

1921
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
the question is again

1922
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
the individual who sees it as a responsibility,

1923
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and moves forward.

1924
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Last year and a half,

1925
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
it was Maja Založnik,

1926
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
COVID-19,

1927
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
last year and a half,

1928
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Maja Založnik,

1929
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and some other people

1930
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
who jumped in at the moment.

1931
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
If there were 300 people active,

1932
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
100 people active weekly,

1933
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
and so on,

1934
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
now we have a scientific community

1935
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
behind it,

1936
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
which is the bearer of the project,

1937
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
so that we can collect donations

1938
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
through it,

1939
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
and so on.

1940
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
That was the main reason

1941
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
for establishing it,

1942
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
and also because we got

1943
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
a commercial version of SLEK

1944
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
as a non-profit.

1945
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And these tasks,

1946
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
to offer some infrastructure,

1947
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
but the society is not the one

1948
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
that contributes,

1949
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
it is the ones

1950
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
that contribute,

1951
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
and so on.

1952
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Some individuals

1953
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
came up with the idea,

1954
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
they were ready to do it,

1955
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
and then there was

1956
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Jakar Danev,

1957
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
who coded it,

1958
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
and in the end,

1959
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
we had a new service.

1960
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
What is now easier,

1961
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
what is not,

1962
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
it is hard to find

1963
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
motivation,

1964
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
it is hard to find the team spirit,

1965
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
because they are just volunteers,

1966
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
and they all have the same time

1967
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
to invest,

1968
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
and then they wait for this,

1969
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
and that, and so on.

1970
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Is this a model,

1971
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
do you need

1972
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
a state entity

1973
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
in these projects,

1974
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
or does it transcend?

1975
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
No,

1976
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
you don't need it.

1977
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Are you making an offer

1978
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
for public good?

1979
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Yes,

1980
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
it came up as a response

1981
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
to a need,

1982
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I think we gave a need to the market.

1983
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
If I tell you what

1984
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
the MWP was,

1985
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
when I was asked what it was,

1986
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I said that all I need

1987
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
is one page,

1988
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I go to one link every day,

1989
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
and I can get

1990
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
quick information about what is going on,

1991
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
or I go deeper and find everything there.

1992
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I don't need to have five pages,

1993
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
three levels down somewhere,

1994
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
to find waste water,

1995
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
data, or whatever.

1996
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
That was the idea,

1997
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
when the idea came up.

1998
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
That's why it's on the long side now,

1999
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
because we haven't refactored it yet,

2000
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
redesigned it,

2001
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
and it still serves as the main idea.

2002
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And then there was a need.

2003
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
We were millions of users,

2004
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
and there are millions of users

2005
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
who access it every month.

2006
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
One thing that I think

2007
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
is particularly important

2008
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
is that

2009
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
open source models

2010
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
enable transparency.

2011
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
They enable openness and transparency,

2012
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and it's all visible.

2013
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Is this also a part

2014
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
where it was the basis

2015
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
for trust that was needed

2016
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
at the same time, I think?

2017
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Yes, to some extent.

2018
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Data that we created

2019
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
was all in CSV,

2020
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
in GitHub, in Diffie.

2021
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Everything was visible.

2022
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
People could verify it,

2023
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
correct it, and send it back.

2024
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And while we were working

2025
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
on the data,

2026
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
we had the validation automatically built in.

2027
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Tanja Ambrozic,

2028
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
who used to work in RIC,

2029
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
the old accounting center,

2030
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
as an analytician,

2031
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
still sends Excel daily

2032
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and recommends

2033
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
if something is missing in a model.

2034
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
You learn something

2035
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
from the people

2036
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
who sing about it.

2037
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Transparency certainly helps.

2038
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
It also helps that

2039
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
a few junior engineers

2040
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
who were at Sladilnik

2041
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
found future jobs

2042
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
at the reference base of Sladilnik.

2043
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
This also happened.

2044
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I don't know.

2045
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
At the end of the day,

2046
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I don't know.

2047
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Maybe it's a great example

2048
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
for discussion,

2049
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
but someone like Šarkaš

2050
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
is now looking for a new career

2051
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
in IT.

2052
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
He worked here on COVID,

2053
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
on healthcare,

2054
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
and contributed a lot.

2055
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It enables a certain environment,

2056
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and in the end,

2057
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
the community is the greatest value.

2058
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
The connections we established

2059
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
are the greatest value

2060
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
for Sladilnik.

2061
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Now,

2062
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
we have a whiteboard here,

2063
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
and it says that we are running out of time

2064
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
for an extremely interesting

2065
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
part.

2066
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I would just quickly...

2067
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The repository is on GitHub,

2068
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
the organization is on GitHub,

2069
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
on Slack. If Sladilnik interests you

2070
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
and you are developers,

2071
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I think you will find a link to it,

2072
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
if you haven't yet.

2073
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So, on behalf of our

2074
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
team, thank you for Sladilnik,

2075
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
and to you and everyone who worked hard

2076
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
for Sladilnik.

2077
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
To conclude,

2078
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
we have two more questions,

2079
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
and then we will wrap up.

2080
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Right at the end.

2081
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
There.

2082
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Now,

2083
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
when I look at

2084
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
some of the people

2085
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
who are connected to Silicon Garden,

2086
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and I think

2087
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
it's a step

2088
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
in the right direction,

2089
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
as a student,

2090
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
a few people

2091
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
stayed in Slovenia.

2092
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
You could have gone to Tuin,

2093
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
and you were in Tuin,

2094
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
but why did you

2095
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
stay in Slovenia?

2096
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Why didn't you run away to Tuin?

2097
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I would say,

2098
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
because of Radansk.

2099
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
When I worked

2100
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
at Silicon Valley,

2101
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I really enjoyed

2102
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
the environment.

2103
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
In 1999-2000,

2104
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I was appointed

2105
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
to San Jose Mercury News,

2106
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
which is a local newspaper,

2107
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
and I was reading it

2108
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
every day,

2109
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
on paper, if you can imagine.

2110
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Inside, there were only good stories

2111
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
about what was happening,

2112
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
about new startups,

2113
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
in a daily newspaper.

2114
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
There were also other local stories,

2115
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
about the process of downtown San Jose,

2116
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
and the fact that this positivism

2117
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
can do anything,

2118
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
was incredible.

2119
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
The project I was working on

2120
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
didn't go well,

2121
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
and I was looking for

2122
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
an alternative,

2123
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
so that I could stay there.

2124
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I identified three companies

2125
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
that I talked to,

2126
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
but in the end,

2127
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
as the right engineer

2128
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
wrote,

2129
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I was ready to

2130
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
leave,

2131
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
and I didn't like it.

2132
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I didn't like

2133
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
the fact that

2134
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
if I didn't prepare

2135
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
the food myself,

2136
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I wouldn't eat well.

2137
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
There were companies

2138
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
that were on a different level.

2139
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
In the end,

2140
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I was a fan of Radansk,

2141
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
and I had the feeling that

2142
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Radansk found me there.

2143
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
So, I decided

2144
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
that the quality of life

2145
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
in Slovenia is relatively good.

2146
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
We don't know

2147
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
what we have

2148
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
at what distance.

2149
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
As long as you're not a fan,

2150
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
you don't know.

2151
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Maybe I'm hard-delivered,

2152
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
that this is so good,

2153
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
maybe I'm a baker,

2154
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I don't know.

2155
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I'm a fan of Radansk,

2156
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
but I don't know

2157
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I had a lot of colleagues

2158
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
with whom I could

2159
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
go to Inno,

2160
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I did careers at EMC,

2161
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Microsoft, Oracle.

2162
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
We had a lot of coaching

2163
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
at the same time.

2164
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Part of that

2165
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
was that there were no opportunities,

2166
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
but I decided that

2167
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
it's a matter of personal decisions.

2168
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Maybe I had a challenge

2169
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
because of that,

2170
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
maybe a small one on the other hand,

2171
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
you can make great stories from here.

2172
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
One last question.

2173
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Give us another

2174
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
world for young people

2175
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
in the industry.

2176
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I also wrote that young people

2177
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
can listen to older people.

2178
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
We all don't know something,

2179
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
so we need a good world.

2180
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Young people who are moving

2181
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
to the sector

2182
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
at the moment,

2183
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
or maybe us,

2184
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
who are young at heart.

2185
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I would like to ask

2186
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
if you are doing something

2187
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
that motivates you personally?

2188
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
That's a question

2189
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
you should ask once a month.

2190
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Do you do it

2191
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
because it motivates you personally?

2192
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Do you do it with a personal motivation?

2193
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Do you believe in the story you are doing?

2194
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
And if not,

2195
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
do you think about what would

2196
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
motivate you?

2197
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Maybe it's an independent path,

2198
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
maybe it's a quick course.

2199
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I haven't done a lot

2200
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
in the history of my career.

2201
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I've been at Hermes Softlab for 18 years,

2202
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
since I was 18.

2203
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
When I found out I would be

2204
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
in the market at 36,

2205
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I found out I would have half my life

2206
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
there, in a company.

2207
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
And the last year and a half

2208
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I was more worried

2209
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
about how I, as a manager

2210
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
of another company,

2211
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
would take on another team.

2212
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I grew up in a team,

2213
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
they bought me,

2214
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I was under their care,

2215
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
and because of that,

2216
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I was able to survive

2217
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
the last year and a half,

2218
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
which were not ideal for my career.

2219
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Ask yourself,

2220
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
does it motivate you?

2221
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
If you are doing something

2222
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
with your personal joy,

2223
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I believe there are a lot of opportunities

2224
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
in the world of IT,

2225
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
where you can do it.

2226
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I am responsible for loyalty,

2227
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I am not the kind of person

2228
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
to change things,

2229
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
but think about

2230
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
what you do,

2231
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
is it a product, a story,

2232
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
do you really believe in it?

2233
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And if not, do you believe in it?

2234
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
That's the first step.

2235
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Why don't you believe in it?

2236
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Why are you not fully in it?

2237
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Because when you start doing it,

2238
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
it will be easy.

2239
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Then you start functioning differently.

2240
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It's not a service anymore,

2241
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
it's something that enriches you,

2242
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
you start enjoying it,

2243
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
and it's not hard at all.

2244
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And the environment around you

2245
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
will change.

2246
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
When you change,

2247
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
the environment around you will change.

2248
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Thank you, Luka,

2249
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
that was our exit.

2250
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Thank you again, Luka Renko,

2251
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
for your interview, we appreciate it.

2252
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Thank you, Tepan Draž,

2253
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
thank you to the team,

2254
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
thank you to Dollar Media for the production,

2255
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
thank you to the viewers.

2256
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Thank you, because you're doing

2257
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
such a dedicated podcast in this area,

2258
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I think it's really enjoyable.

2259
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
If you listen to it regularly.

2260
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Yes.

2261
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
The problem is that

2262
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
there are no more daily commutes,

2263
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
and then there are opportunities for that,

2264
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
even when I wash dishes,

2265
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I still listen to the podcast,

2266
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
and it's just fleeting time,

2267
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
the listener does too much,

2268
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
and so on.

2269
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I listen to it regularly.

2270
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
You can listen to us too,

2271
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
we have a diadrama.

2272
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
No, we have other sounds,

2273
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
you don't like them.

2274
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Thank you for being with us,

2275
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
see you next time,

2276
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
there are links below for support,

2277
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
and see you next time.

2278
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Did we forget something? That's it.

2279
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Thank you.

2280
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Good luck.
