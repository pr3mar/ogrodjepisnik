1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's start. Welcome to the new episode of Eugrodija.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the 20th episode.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
21th.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
21th episode.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The second episode with video support.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you read the first one, it was an experiment.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first one was an experiment, but it was so good that it wasn't exactly a pure experiment.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So today we will try to succeed with video support,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we will be more reliable to our co-producers on sound, so we respect that too.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Today we have a new guest with us, Dr. C. R. Goll.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We will talk about Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence from the perspective of engineering.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We will try to go deeper into how Artificial Intelligence changes our world,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
how it changes the planet, how we will lose services.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We talked a little about those topics that are related to it.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't talk anymore, because then AndraÅ¾a won't like it, because I have too many secrets.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No problem, you will tell a lot of things, and listeners and viewers will be disappointed,

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because we won't touch those things, because we will run out of time.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We don't know how long this episode will be.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If it's too long, we will split it into two parts.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, Boris, can I introduce you?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can try.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I can try.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Boris is a master that I have been training for years,

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and he positions himself very well in Artificial Intelligence, in the use of Artificial Intelligence,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and is a part of the product of the use of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You also have a very interesting career path, so I will ask you a few questions about that.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So, today you are in charge of Artificial Intelligence, data, and data science, if I understand correctly.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, I lead the data discipline, and everything that is related to data falls into it.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Data engineering, machine learning, data analytics.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now, when we last talked in person, I think we talked in Porto Rojo,

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and you said you were going to the Slovenian Entry Festival, and you will be the headliner there.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How did you present yourself there?

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Actually, I remember well, because I focused so much on what I was going to say, or show,

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that I had the idea that half of it was just talking about slides, and the other half was demo examples,

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and that's a lot of art, so you can really prepare me well if I want to sing in a short time.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, let's first find out how you tried to create such a serious business that deals with Artificial Intelligence.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or we will first find out what Artificial Intelligence is.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Or we will first find out what Buzzword is, and what it really is.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, okay, let's start with that.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I mean, I don't know if we're going to go back now.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now, tell me, why do you believe so much in Artificial Intelligence, that you and your friends decided to establish Ektimo,

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and why do you think it's time to do some sub-ethnic business in this area?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, first of all, I want to say that it was all part of a big strategic plan.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It wasn't like that in the beginning.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
At the very beginning, I thought I was doing things related to finance,

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
quantitative finance, fascinating algorithms, the idea that you can make better decisions

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
if you look at the data at the top, and so on.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We established this business at a very interesting time,

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
when in the Slovenian area, the financial industry was at its peak in the 1920s,

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ready to invest.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, I started to think a lot about how we could expand what we were doing with algorithms,

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and so I quickly realized that what I was starting to gain in terms of data knowledge,

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
there was no reason to limit it to just one industry.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I was even younger at the time, and a bit more naive.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then, when I looked at what was happening in the United States in this area in the late 1990s,

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I had a feeling that everything was already done, that I could start a business here.

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Later on, I learned that we were probably Slovenia, five years ago, maybe even more.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But you positioned yourself as a company that would work in Slovenia,

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
did you say Slovenian market, or whoever comes?

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes, you're right, maybe it wasn't so strategically thought out.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In practice, we were a company that worked mostly in the Slovenian area,

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
more because of intelligence than because of strategy.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What I later saw was that it was crucial to find a way to talk to people in the markets,

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
where there was enough capital for investment in this area,

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
maybe there was also a greater market development, and later on,

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the transition to these markets.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If I were to go back in time, I would try to make it so that in six months of my life,

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
somewhere in the suburbs of London, I would show up at some meetups,

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and I would get in touch with people.

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now, let's explain what this business is about, what problems do you have,

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
what do you solve, to make it clearer.

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We're still talking about ECT.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, yes.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a bit of a blast from the past, as you would say.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's how you put it.

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's good that we started with that.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What kind of artificial intelligence was there in the 18th century?

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Or a little earlier.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The idea was to help companies build systems where data science was a key element.

81
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But as some kind of advanced BI?

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, no, no.

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean, to set up models of machine learning that would make predictions,

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
which would then be used by companies.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But in a very generic way, do you mean a different type of data,

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
or is it a specific type?

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It was more generic.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Generic in the sense that we didn't move to an industrial vertical,

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but more niche in the sense that we targeted data science.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We didn't offer data engineering students,

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
software development by hand, and so on.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now, one topic that we will somehow discuss a little later.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
People have come, and even today,

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
companies that implement artificial intelligence,

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that solve problems with artificial intelligence,

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
because they are looking for a solution that will be based on artificial intelligence.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is this knowledge available on the market?

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or do people come and say,

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
we have such a big problem that we can't solve it any other way,

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
can you help us?

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is this knowledge available on the market?

102
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think it can be divided into two categories.

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think that many of the problems that companies have,

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
they don't realize that with the right model of artificial intelligence,

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
they could solve it today.

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think that people on the market will be looking for people

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to help them implement this thing,

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
because they simply don't realize that it can be solved in this way.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I think there is a lot of it.

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
In the last 10 years, we have invested a little too little in this,

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
we don't have an internal team.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Can someone on the market help us put this together quickly?

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because we are a little behind, for example.

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are old-fashioned.

115
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I went a little further.

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You went from Ektima to Comtrade, Digital Services,

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and now you are developing these things in Endavit.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
With a larger reach, in a larger company, with a larger budget,

119
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
everything together has become more serious.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I haven't thought about it yet.

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Actually, it was quite a leap from Ektima

122
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to one of the larger IT companies in Slovenia, in Riga at the time.

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It was an interesting experience.

124
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I think that someone who is used to living in a small company

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and constantly working on innovation

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
can bring a lot to a larger company.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is difficult, because it is very rare in 10 years

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that someone makes a leap from a small management company

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to a larger company.

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
My experience was very positive.

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Then, a little later, I moved to a foreign company,

132
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
which has an even larger system.

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We will talk about this a little later,

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
about Artificial Intelligence.

135
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you think that the size of the company

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
that deals with these technologies has a role?

137
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Can we say that these are tools that AndraÅ¾ Zdelek

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
from SP can take and start working with?

139
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you need a larger engineering team?

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you think that this is an experience?

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is something that has changed a lot

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
in the last few months or years.

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Actually, for applications of Artificial Intelligence,

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
when it was five years ago,

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
there was a tendency for larger teams to implement it easier.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now, with the arrival of new models,

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
pre-learned, with huge amounts of data,

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
with better tooling that helps these things in production,

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it seems to me that it is more even ground.

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Perhaps a larger company can cope

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
with greater difficulties in implementation,

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because there is no need for limitations

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
when it comes to technological solutions.

154
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But there can be limitations in how to change business processes

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
so that this technology can reach its goal.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Change management in large companies is really difficult.

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
OK.

158
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Watch this segway, AndraÅ¾.

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now that I've prepared for this episode,

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I've read some books about Artificial Intelligence,

161
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Artificial Intelligence for Engineers,

162
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and I've read some different books.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
One book that I will refer to later in the notes

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
is this one, How Machines Think.

165
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In this book, there are very illustrative

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
algorithms that are used,

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
from what should be done to drive a smart car,

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to how smart video recognition is,

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
various concepts.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The introduction is like this,

171
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
let's talk about how machines think,

172
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
how machines are prepared to be smarter,

173
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and what algorithms are behind it.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
In the introduction of this book,

175
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
a very good example is that in 1737,

176
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
a French artist made a robot,

177
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
an automaton, that could play the piano.

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It could play 12 different melodies,

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
12 different songs.

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It had a mechanism like those old clocks,

181
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and it was very popular.

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It was seen by the majority of people

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
as a crazy thing for gamers and entertainment.

184
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He made it, and then a group of skeptics

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
started asking themselves how this thing works.

186
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
King Ludwig, who was the boss at the time,

187
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
said that it was a fake, that it couldn't be.

188
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There was a little girl inside,

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
who knew how to play it, 5 years old,

190
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and she knew the melodies.

191
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They totally rejected him.

192
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The church also said that it was a blasphemy,

193
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
that the machine couldn't be smarter.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Then he wrote that he presented his idea,

195
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
how his machine works in front of an academy of science,

196
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and he explained the mechanisms,

197
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
how the hands move, and how the machine works.

198
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He got a recognition from the Science Board,

199
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that it was a legit machine.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But society saw all the problems

201
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
through what was done,

202
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and they didn't understand what to do,

203
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
how the machine works,

204
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and why it was made.

205
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'd like to dig deeper into these things,

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and see how these algorithms work today,

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
what is needed for things to work,

208
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and how we develop them in the future.

209
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Here we're probably...

210
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay, go ahead.

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Great.

212
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Here we're probably talking about something

213
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that was learned in advance.

214
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The algorithm only works once,

215
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
for those 15 minutes, and so on.

216
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When we talk about AI,

217
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the parameters can change.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The decision-making tree is much bigger.

219
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can put it this way.

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The algorithm is a whole procedure

221
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to solve a specific problem.

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And that's true when we talk about this system.

223
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I agree that this is a definition of the algorithm.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I think that...

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I guess it depends on how broadly

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and extensively you define the problem.

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In the beginning,

228
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
the path this technology chose

229
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
was always more against the system,

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
because the same system can solve

231
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
a lot of different problems.

232
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I think that in the end,

233
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
it will go in that direction,

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
with a system that is always more complex.

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We can then debate where this complexity ends.

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This is a topic that is often separated

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
when people say, for example,

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
complex artificial intelligence.

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What does that mean?

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It means that people are not entirely AI,

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
because there are a lot of problems

242
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
that we don't have and don't know.

243
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We are not biologically well-constructed

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
to be able to solve them entirely.

245
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I agree.

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The operating system knows everything.

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And then you have programs

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that are specifically designed

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
to solve a specific problem.

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Can you imagine that?

251
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes.

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You have a whole core...

253
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You are going to skip the whole story,

254
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but I think that the systems

255
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
that are still at the beginning,

256
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
but are still accessible enough

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
for us to start working with them today.

258
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We can work on such a system.

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We have an orchestrator that gets tasks

260
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and then decides for an individual task

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
that came up.

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Which other sub-system is best suited

263
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
to solve that task.

264
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It sends that task to the sub-system,

265
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
it is already present,

266
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and it needs to solve that task even more,

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
or it can solve it by itself

268
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and send it back to the orchestrator as a solution.

269
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That is one such system.

270
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Most artificial intelligence systems

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
are not like that today.

272
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Most systems are not like that.

273
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Maybe it would be good to take a step back

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
because of these differences,

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
because now we have more to change.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Most artificial intelligence systems

277
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
functioned in such a way

278
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that they solved one exact,

279
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
very precisely defined problem.

280
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
To solve such a problem,

281
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
it was necessary to learn the model again.

282
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Most of the time it meant

283
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
to get the data,

284
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
to get the information,

285
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to get the data that was taken very precisely

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
with that specific problem.

287
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
To mark that data, for example.

288
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If we wanted to classify things,

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
we could first mark it,

290
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
learn the model,

291
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
then put that model into production,

292
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
see how well it works,

293
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and as soon as there were

294
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
more noticeable changes in the distribution of those examples,

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
we went out of the distribution

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
where it was learned,

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the problem was no longer working well,

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
then the whole art was to find out when it happens,

299
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
to give new data,

300
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to give a new designation.

301
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Problems are very, very difficult,

302
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and subsequently also difficult

303
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
in an unusual way.

304
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Even if the system, as it was learned,

305
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
knew how to solve that problem relatively well,

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
if we then think through the whole life cycle,

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
what expenses will there be,

308
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
how many people will be able to keep some distance,

309
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it's not a pile of water.

310
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What started to change

311
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
with those pre-learned models,

312
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
a few years ago,

313
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
was the concept that if we take a model

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and really learn it

315
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
in a huge amount of data,

316
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
which includes a lot of different problems,

317
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
we can imagine

318
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
how a pile of different distributions

319
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
would mix together

320
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and thus learn,

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
then we come to a model

322
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that is able to solve

323
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
different problems

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
in the same model

325
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and is also somewhat more robust

326
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
because it was not in such a singular distribution at all.

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But what you're talking about now,

328
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
is that something you've already used?

329
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes, yes.

330
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's put it this way,

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the architecture of transformers

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
was the driving force

333
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
for the development of this trend.

334
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think it was in 2017,

335
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
somewhere around that time.

336
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
An important thing here was

337
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the need for a change

338
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
in the classical system.

339
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The data had to be rewritten.

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
One interesting solution was the so-called

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
self-supervised learning,

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
where we can take unmarked data

343
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and imagine,

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
or rather say it in pictures,

345
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that we have a picture,

346
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and give it an analog model

347
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
on the basis of the remains of the picture

348
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
to tell us which cube we took out.

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And we can do the same for the text.

350
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But if you only chose one

351
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
out of the whole set,

352
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
would that be enough?

353
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No, no. Imagine you take

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
100 million pictures,

355
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
each of which you take out a cube,

356
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and then you say...

357
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, you mean a subset of 100,000.

358
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No, no. You take 100 million pictures,

359
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
each of which you take out a cube,

360
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
you use the rest of the cubes,

361
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and you give it an analog model

362
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
to tell you what's missing.

363
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because at one point you don't need

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to know what's missing.

365
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You try to learn from the context,

366
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
from the remains of the picture.

367
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's the same with speech.

368
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll give you some examples.

369
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
For example, let's talk about language.

370
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Language was the driver

371
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
of the development of new methods.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
For example,

373
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
basic sentences.

374
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
An apple fell out.

375
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But then there was a tree,

376
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
but that word is missing now.

377
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
When a model sees enough sentences,

378
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
if it wants to become better

379
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
when it tells you

380
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
what word is missing,

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
it probably forms a representation

382
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
instead of an apple growing on a tree.

383
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If it falls from a tree,

384
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
it's more likely to fall from a tree

385
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
than from a shelf.

386
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It can also fall from a shelf.

387
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We'll get to that later.

388
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You need a huge amount of data

389
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to be able to...

390
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
To work with solutions.

391
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It must cost a lot.

392
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's a huge cost.

393
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
To some extent, it's true.

394
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But it's not the same concept.

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Trash in, trash out.

396
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You can help your neighbors.

397
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
For example, if you have some data trust.

398
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
For example, Wikipedia, or books, for example.

399
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And then you can look at some of the basic properties of the text in those high-quality sources.

400
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Then you go through everything you've scraped down from the Internet,

401
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and then you protect those things that are a little more similar to those high-quality sources,

402
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and the rest goes to the side.

403
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So, in fact, if you've calculated it all, it took you some money and time,

404
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
but in the sense of programming, you don't have to deal with it much,

405
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
because those things fall out on their own.

406
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And we have a lot of that data.

407
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So those models...

408
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We have a lot, who has a lot?

409
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, you can have a lot of them.

410
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
At the beginning there is this Common Crawl,

411
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
which is actually a collection of what scrapers pick up from the Internet.

412
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's available, although it's huge.

413
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So maybe you need a little more money to be able to do something with it,

414
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
but at the beginning those data are there, you can use them.

415
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Now, I'm going to tell you about a project we started,

416
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and I'm going to tell you about the problems you've already solved in some way,

417
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and you're going to tell me what the next generation of such a system would be like,

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
so that it can be done better.

419
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Are you ready for that?

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
What?

421
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Are you going to tell me your pet project?

422
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
No, no, no.

423
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm going to be stupid in consulting.

424
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No, no, no.

425
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll pay you later.

426
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Okay, so the problem was this.

427
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We developed a technology for massively inquiring people.

428
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
More languages around the world.

429
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
People come in and you ask them questions,

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you put a chat bot,

431
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
you ask them questions,

432
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
people give you answers,

433
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
they get a reward.

434
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Which in theory is a very good way to get very interesting data,

435
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
you can do it massively, great.

436
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The problem is that this concept of giving people a reward for participating on the Internet

437
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
attracts a lot of off-roaders, logically.

438
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And the challenge we had was how to develop a system

439
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that would ensure that those who answer the question

440
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
would answer honestly,

441
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
not just click,

442
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and as soon as they come to the reward, they pay.

443
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
We needed a system that would give a score,

444
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
or an indicator,

445
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
if the answer really belongs to the person or not.

446
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And what did we do?

447
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We created a system that recorded all the small micro-interactions

448
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
that a person did on the control room,

449
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
and then we combined them with the answers.

450
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
For example, how you moved the mouse,

451
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
how you moved the hoverboard to an element,

452
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
how you changed your mind.

453
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
For example, you asked him,

454
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
is the moon the sun?

455
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And then you asked him the other question,

456
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
is the moon still the sun?

457
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And if these two answers were correct, it was a logical task.

458
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Anyway, we collected a huge amount of data and parameters,

459
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
we formed some 12 features,

460
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and then we said,

461
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
okay, a combination of micrometrics and answers,

462
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
we can label and make a label,

463
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
this is legit, this is not legit.

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And we labeled the dataset,

465
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and we had a relatively good system to prepare it,

466
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
whether it was in a file or not.

467
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The task was great,

468
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
but there was a problem,

469
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
when the user changed,

470
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
the interactions started to change,

471
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
then there were problems,

472
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
for example, the number of questions changed,

473
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and it affected...

474
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Whatever we changed,

475
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
it was actually not robust enough,

476
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
we had to train it again,

477
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
learn it again.

478
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
This will prepare the life cycle,

479
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
how the scoring works,

480
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
whether it is still relevant or not,

481
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because it started to affect us.

482
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
This is an example of what we were doing,

483
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and we solved the problem.

484
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I wonder how we could do it more robustly,

485
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
in the context where you put it first.

486
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Is it possible?

487
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It is possible,

488
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
but on the other side,

489
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
on the front side,

490
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
capabilities are improving.

491
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Absolutely.

492
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I would like to ask,

493
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
why did you need to collect data?

494
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Do you mean data for fraud prevention,

495
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
or just data?

496
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
No, just data.

497
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Data was used for market research,

498
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
on a global scale,

499
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
we were interested in

500
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
whether people use YouTube,

501
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
TikTok,

502
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
how long they are on TikTok,

503
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
mobile banking,

504
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
we were interested in everything

505
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
people do in the digital space.

506
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
These data were very important

507
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
for global corporations,

508
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
they have to allocate a global budget

509
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
for product development,

510
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
marketing,

511
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and so on.

512
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
These are very important data

513
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
on what people do.

514
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The problem is that

515
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
when you give a bounty

516
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
for someone to solve it,

517
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
then you have a question,

518
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
people click on the question,

519
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
if you click on the question,

520
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
then it is something

521
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that is quite easy to automate.

522
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh yes.

523
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Or if it is for some simple

524
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
text input and so on,

525
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
it is not difficult to do.

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
With these new approaches,

527
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I would probably say

528
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
that the fraud detection part

529
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
has changed the way

530
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
data is collected.

531
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Why not have a proactive bot,

532
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
which would find people

533
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
in a carefully selected

534
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
natural habitat,

535
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and talk to them

536
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
in a free-flow chat,

537
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
which is then

538
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
a little harder

539
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
to swallow.

540
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I can say that

541
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I was very hijacked

542
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
in the whole debate,

543
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but the next thing

544
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I described was text.

545
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
People write text

546
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
or click buttons.

547
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The next generation of this system

548
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
was sound.

549
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
These questions were written,

550
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
those questions were processed

551
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
through sound,

552
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and then it went into

553
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
listen mode,

554
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and when you answered,

555
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
part of the real-time

556
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
speech-to-text transition

557
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
took place.

558
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And what you are doing

559
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
quickly showed

560
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
what was happening

561
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
in the space.

562
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Then it turned out

563
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
that people solve it

564
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
in an underground railway

565
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
or on a bus.

566
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
On the other hand,

567
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
you collected emotions,

568
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
people answered very gently,

569
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
or when they realized

570
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that the microphones

571
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
were about to turn off.

572
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It turned out that

573
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
through a lot of scripting,

574
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
a lot of people today

575
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
make fun of writing

576
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
buttons for the microphone,

577
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and that the script

578
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
started to fail

579
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
because they didn't have a microphone.

580
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So, yes,

581
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
this aspect can be improved,

582
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
but then comes

583
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the scale.

584
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Textually,

585
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
interacting with people

586
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
is really expensive,

587
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
because sound and infrastructure

588
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
are different things.

589
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Privacy is also important.

590
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes, I agree.

591
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's a waste of time and money.

592
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yes.

593
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Okay, I'm done.

594
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
As far as

595
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Frodo is concerned,

596
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
there is a constant

597
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
war, a competition

598
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
between...

599
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
What is a cat-and-mouse game?

600
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The only thing that is clear

601
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
is that you can't

602
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
use artificial intelligence

603
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
in this game,

604
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and let others

605
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
have the advantage.

606
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I think it quickly

607
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
fell apart.

608
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
When we looked at the data

609
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
in this system,

610
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
when we activated our system,

611
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
it fell apart

612
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
very quickly.

613
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But then

614
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
a few people

615
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
got to know

616
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
the tools you use

617
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
against the ones you use,

618
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and then they started simulating

619
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
how the mouse moves to make it work better.

620
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And it really is a cat-and-mouse game.

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Frodo completely.

622
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes,

623
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
when you have money in your pocket,

624
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
on the other hand,

625
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
there is a lot of interest in it.

626
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'll give you

627
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
an example,

628
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I wouldn't call it a fraud,

629
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but a dark pattern.

630
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
For example,

631
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
a company

632
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
offers you an order,

633
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
it's very easy to make an order,

634
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
but if you want

635
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
to cancel it,

636
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it's very difficult.

637
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You have to go through all the steps,

638
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and for them,

639
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
it may not be

640
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the most moral

641
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
or so on,

642
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
but it's understandable.

643
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
They have even less

644
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
of their own systems,

645
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
because you are

646
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
allowed to do it

647
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
in an unoptimal way.

648
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
What happens

649
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
is that

650
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
as you

651
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
imagine

652
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and imagine,

653
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
one thing that will

654
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
slowly raise the cost

655
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
for this dark pattern

656
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
is that

657
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
the logic

658
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
on their side looks completely different.

659
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
For example,

660
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
if you have a bot

661
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
that can automatically

662
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
go through all those

663
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
strange steps and cancel the order,

664
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
they may now have

665
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
on their side

666
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
some expense

667
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
that goes

668
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
for the interaction

669
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
with your bot.

670
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It can be very expensive for you,

671
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but they have to be in an interaction

672
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
with millions of bots,

673
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and

674
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
these things can

675
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
turn upside down.

676
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think we'll see some of that

677
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
in this area.

678
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
These quite obvious

679
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
dark patterns may not work anymore,

680
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
because there will be some level of

681
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
intelligence on both sides,

682
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
not just on one.

683
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But that's good.

684
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
One more

685
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
similar example.

686
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
For example,

687
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
in law,

688
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
not all people have

689
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
laws for everything,

690
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
but people have

691
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
very different access

692
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
to people who can help them

693
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
navigate these laws.

694
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And of course,

695
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
this is very much needed.

696
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
A company that has a lot of money for its employees

697
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
may have a lot of money

698
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and manage to do something.

699
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Now, if you

700
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
introduce

701
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
an extra-priced service,

702
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
legal aid,

703
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
that

704
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
reduces the gap

705
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
between what the weak

706
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and the powerful have,

707
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I think this can change

708
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
the whole dynamic.

709
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Which is good again.

710
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I mean, I believe

711
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
that...

712
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Why are you avoiding me?

713
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Let's move on

714
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
to the topics that are weak.

715
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
No, no, I'm trying, but...

716
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What has become,

717
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I see it as evolutionarily good,

718
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and at the same time,

719
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
this gap is decreasing.

720
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So,

721
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
a company that doesn't have these opportunities

722
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
is now coming to some opportunities,

723
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
while a company that needs it a lot

724
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
is now,

725
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
its position is now a bit different.

726
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Let's be specific,

727
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
for those who may be more interested.

728
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
A company that deals with such things

729
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
is Do Not Pay.

730
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
They have become

731
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
quite well-known in this area,

732
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and it's worth looking at

733
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
what is the last thing they have.

734
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This Do Not Pay,

735
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I understood,

736
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
they are fighting

737
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
against you paying

738
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
those subscriptions,

739
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
that you don't pay anything.

740
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
No, I think they are positioning themselves

741
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
as some kind of

742
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
small consumer

743
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
average person advocate.

744
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
In various interactions

745
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
with the system.

746
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It can be about cancelling orders,

747
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
it can be about some kind of

748
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
basic legal aid, and so on.

749
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But I think that

750
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
just a few weeks ago,

751
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
they challenged

752
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to give some kind of award

753
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to an artificial intelligence

754
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
that will be able to win

755
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
in court in some cases.

756
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yes, in Germany,

757
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I think it will be in Germany,

758
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
there will be a trial,

759
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
although I think it will still be

760
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
for some parking lot,

761
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
some high stakes.

762
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And the party

763
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
will represent itself,

764
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
because it has the opportunity,

765
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and it will have a hearing,

766
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
where the model will decide

767
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But they also offered

768
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
for one million dollars

769
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
an award to someone who would be prepared

770
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
to go to a similar trial,

771
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
but in front of the US Constitutional Court.

772
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Which would be hard to do,

773
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
because people commented

774
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
that you can't do that

775
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
at all.

776
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But

777
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I believe they are quite confident

778
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
in what they currently have,

779
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
what is currently possible.

780
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
For example, I saw a video

781
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
where they were talking

782
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
with a representative

783
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
of a charity

784
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
about lowering the age limit,

785
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and it was broadcasted.

786
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I think

787
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
it was for Comcast,

788
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to lower the age limit.

789
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And that's just

790
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the tip of the iceberg

791
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
where it will go.

792
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think you can see

793
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
even more of this

794
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
in the meat industry.

795
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Will it always be

796
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
affordable?

797
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I look at it

798
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
as a usable perspective

799
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
when it comes to

800
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
new products.

801
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
For example,

802
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
what are the products

803
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
that people would like

804
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
to have and use?

805
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
One option is to look at

806
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
what rich people use

807
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and try to

808
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
imagine what it would look like

809
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
if you did it a thousand times cheaper.

810
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Would things change or not?

811
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Of course it would be cheaper.

812
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I think that things

813
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
like an assistant

814
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
who instead of you

815
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
handles

816
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
offering telecommunications,

817
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
or I don't know, you make

818
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
various reservations,

819
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
something together with which you want to engage,

820
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think there is a lot of potential here.

821
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I think that

822
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
this year will be the same

823
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
when these types of agents

824
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
will move forward.

825
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Now I would like to

826
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
try to talk

827
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
a little more about these concepts.

828
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What we could do at the beginning.

829
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What we could do at the beginning.

830
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Can you explain to us

831
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
the concept

832
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
of artificial intelligence,

833
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
machine learning and deep learning?

834
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What are the

835
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
connections and where

836
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
does it lead us?

837
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
What is the buzzword?

838
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What is the marketing buzzword?

839
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What is Hollywood?

840
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
What is sci-fi?

841
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What is the business

842
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
we are talking about in this term?

843
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Let's start with artificial intelligence.

844
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The most

845
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
adored word here.

846
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This is a very

847
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
complex thing.

848
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
A lot of things

849
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
can fall into it.

850
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I personally

851
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
see it like this.

852
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
A system that

853
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
produces outputs

854
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
based on some inputs

855
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
that are consistent

856
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
with some

857
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
optimization function.

858
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
This is the subsequent point

859
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
that we can almost

860
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
talk about. For example,

861
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
a system that looks

862
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
at the value

863
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
of a temperature sensor

864
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and then

865
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
gives you an output

866
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
based on the value

867
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
is a kind of intelligence.

868
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It sounds like

869
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
an if

870
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
or case clause.

871
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It can be.

872
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I do not exclude them

873
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
automatically

874
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
.

875
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This is purely

876
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
official.

877
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
In practice, people use it like this.

878
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Artificial intelligence is all

879
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
that we don't know how to do yet.

880
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Subsequently, it also directs

881
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
the whole

882
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
discussion.

883
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
For example, one company says it uses

884
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
artificial intelligence.

885
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It uses some three inputs.

886
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Then you get a lot of money.

887
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe.

888
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But people will say

889
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
that this is not artificial intelligence.

890
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Artificial intelligence is just that.

891
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Then we go forward.

892
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Do you want to say that

893
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
artificial intelligence is what is massively

894
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
needed in marketing purposes?

895
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
In any case,

896
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
it is needed.

897
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I see that

898
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
you added a bunch of products

899
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
with new names, which are actually old products.

900
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Now we have some kind of artificial intelligence

901
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
inside.

902
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Probably similar to what you said before.

903
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
A couple of ifs that are now smartly decided.

904
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I think this is an example.

905
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
As far as ifs are concerned,

906
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
this moment,

907
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
maybe the last two years, is quite harmful.

908
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Because, for example,

909
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
people use it as an excuse.

910
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, this is not

911
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
really smart.

912
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
These are just if-inputs.

913
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We are now very deep

914
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
in a period when

915
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
we have gone relatively far away

916
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
from any kind of if-inputs.

917
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But then,

918
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
no one is offended

919
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
because we all

920
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
saw those memes

921
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
where it says up and down,

922
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and then there are if-inputs.

923
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
But we are no longer the same.

924
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yes, but I mean,

925
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
if we go back,

926
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
what kind of machine do you think

927
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
at the end of the day

928
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
there is a machine

929
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
that works on some

930
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
zeros?

931
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yes, I don't know.

932
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It is true that we have built more abstractions,

933
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
especially in mathematics.

934
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I mean, the counter-argument

935
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
for this kind of argument

936
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
is always that

937
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
you are not some kind of machine.

938
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
If they would look deep enough at you,

939
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
what would they see? Some molecules?

940
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Where is the magic?

941
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
He says he has a soul,

942
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and he has free will.

943
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yes, but all machines now also say they have.

944
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Only the right to work can be at the beginning.

945
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Sooner or later, you won't even need that anymore.

946
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But if we go back

947
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
a little bit,

948
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
if the concept of artificial intelligence is so complex,

949
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
then what is machine learning?

950
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
A lot of people use it just like that,

951
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
as a nickname.

952
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Machine learning is

953
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the process of

954
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
teaching something to the model,

955
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
or the machine

956
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
is teaching something.

957
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So,

958
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
we are a bit more complicated here.

959
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
We are not

960
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
decision-makers,

961
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
we don't have any

962
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
functions, but this is

963
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
just a learning process.

964
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But machine learning is

965
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
key to artificial intelligence?

966
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Yes.

967
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
In the beginning...

968
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I mean, you can

969
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
accept...

970
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
You will have examples when you can

971
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
accept some decisions,

972
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
or produce some output,

973
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
without having to have a very powerful component of some learning.

974
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Most of the things that interest you

975
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
are necessary learning.

976
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And if we go

977
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
to deep learning,

978
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
deep learning is a special

979
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
branch of machine

980
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
learning,

981
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
which is based on many

982
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
neural networks,

983
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
as some basic

984
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
architecture.

985
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Probably,

986
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
some other architectures could

987
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
implement this concept, but

988
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
this is a paradigm

989
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
that has been

990
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
implemented

991
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
for the last 10 years,

992
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and still exists.

993
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Of course,

994
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
the question is, what now?

995
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Is this it?

996
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't think so yet.

997
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I think there is still a long way

998
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
to go for

999
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
improvement.

1000
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I like

1001
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
this definition.

1002
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I can say that it was

1003
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
a period of deep learning.

1004
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Then we switched to

1005
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
big learning.

1006
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I like it, because

1007
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
it's a great buzzword,

1008
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
deep learning and big data combined.

1009
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
If you can't sell anything with it,

1010
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
then you really can't do anything.

1011
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But the point is,

1012
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
models that require

1013
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
so much computational power,

1014
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and are trained on such huge amounts of data,

1015
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
that you can't

1016
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
transfer them to a smaller laboratory,

1017
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
but only big tech

1018
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
or very well-funded startups

1019
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
can do it.

1020
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That's what we've seen in the last few years.

1021
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The models that are

1022
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
talked about the most today

1023
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
are typical examples of that.

1024
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
With those cutting-edge

1025
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
products,

1026
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and then we'll talk more about those products,

1027
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
is there

1028
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
a way of deep learning

1029
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
or

1030
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
an evolution of deep learning,

1031
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
or is it a hybrid approach?

1032
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Is it a secret?

1033
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
The reason why

1034
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
we're here,

1035
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
why we're talking about it today,

1036
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
is deep learning.

1037
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
If that didn't happen,

1038
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and if we didn't have those things,

1039
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
then I wouldn't be talking about it.

1040
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Maybe I'd be talking about it in CryptoCon.

1041
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
No, I wouldn't.

1042
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I still have a few lists.

1043
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Those two things are definitely connected.

1044
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Crypto and AI

1045
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
are definitely connected.

1046
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
No, let's move on.

1047
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We'll cut that part.

1048
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
What was really important

1049
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
within deep learning

1050
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
was the point, I think I already mentioned it,

1051
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
the architecture of transformers.

1052
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I think it's better to

1053
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
do it with a few slides.

1054
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
But the mechanism

1055
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
that's behind it

1056
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
is attention.

1057
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That was very, very

1058
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
important.

1059
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Roughly speaking, it's because

1060
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
you get a context,

1061
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and then you take

1062
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
the whole context,

1063
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and you weigh the parts

1064
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
in the context

1065
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
that deserve more attention.

1066
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But that process is

1067
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
human interaction,

1068
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
when it decides,

1069
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
or is it built

1070
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
based on what?

1071
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
As much as it can

1072
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
pay attention to. That's the beauty of it.

1073
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So this paradigm, when it started, is now being applied to all possible examples of use.

1074
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:25,000
At the beginning, they were words, then they were pictures, then they are now multimodal models that can take colors out, connect those colors, and so on.

1075
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Can I ask about deep learning? Is it about neural networks that are connected to each other?

1076
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:45,000
What do you mean by deep? What is meant by deep? Layers that you can put together, neurons that you can put together?

1077
00:50:45,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Imagine that you have layers made up of many neurons, and the signal travels through those layers, and those layers are typically large.

1078
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What is it, 100,000, 10,000,000?

1079
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
No, no, I don't mean 100,000,000.

1080
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Just a feeling?

1081
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Well, let me put it this way, basic things. We talk a lot about parameters in these models.

1082
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Here, a parameter is, let's say, the weight of each connection between two neurons.

1083
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
How many connections are there?

1084
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:44,000
At the moment, let's say, I don't know, the model used by PTTRI has 175 billion connections.

1085
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Now, in fact, there are also more complex models that go against billions, or maybe we are already somewhere above that.

1086
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But is that a parameter that you add when you learn the network?

1087
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
No, no, that's the same thing that the network learns. The network learns how it should be.

1088
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But the number that you mentioned, billions, is that a limit that you want to train?

1089
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Not more, but is that the consequence?

1090
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yes, you define that.

1091
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,000
At the beginning, when you set up the architecture of the network, you know how many layers to choose, how many connections to choose, and so on.

1092
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But what are the values ââof each of these, the network then learns by itself.

1093
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I don't know.

1094
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Did you learn anything?

1095
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
That's the whole point. Well, not just me, I hope there will be people who will learn and listen to us here.

1096
00:52:46,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Now, we have a question, can you tell us a little more about the projects you are doing in NDAVI with these technologies?

1097
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Then I can ask you more about AI products, and maybe we can talk a little about how they work for you.

1098
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I would really like to hear what kind of day-to-day project you are working on, so that people can get a sense of what the industry is doing.

1099
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I know you work with 4GTP, so you can say.

1100
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Maybe it would be like this, what is this moment?

1101
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
If we make a time lapse, what are the problems that are being solved?

1102
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Are they really real?

1103
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:48,000
We can detect some things in the pictures for the purposes of production or medicine.

1104
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:58,000
We can tell some prices, we can tell the amount of inventory that is needed.

1105
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
These are things that are already known to people.

1106
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But at the same time, we are still actively developing internally.

1107
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Now we can go for things that use the latest technologies as much as possible.

1108
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:34,000
For example, coding assistants, systems for optimally managing knowledge in companies, various bots for answering questions, and so on.

1109
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
When you go to a job interview, they always ask you what your pet projects are.

1110
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Do you want to say what your pet project is?

1111
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm working a little more on how you play.

1112
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I can also sum it up.

1113
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Sometimes there are some things that I do and they are so interesting that I can say about my pet project.

1114
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:15,000
One thing that I do in my free time is a semantic scanner for tweets.

1115
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:24,000
This is such a functionality that a person would like to be productive on their own.

1116
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
What do I mean by that?

1117
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
For example, I like a bunch of tweets.

1118
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Then there comes a moment when someone grabs me and I would like to touch on some topics that have come to my radar.

1119
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But how do you find this now?

1120
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Now I'm doing this, for example, I'm going to take this tweet, then I'm going to take some tweets that are contextually related to it.

1121
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Then you take a picture that someone has pasted, and then you look at what the personality of that picture is.

1122
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Then you look at what people wrote in that tweet when they quoted it or tweeted it.

1123
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Then you take it all together, put it in GPT-3 to summarize it carefully.

1124
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Then you put all these things in a vector database, and in the end, it's not over yet.

1125
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The idea is to write a topic that interests you and automatically attracts those tweets that are the most relevant.

1126
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:38,000
In other words, you have to understand the nature of tweets, you have to know how to connect with the broader context of what people are saying.

1127
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But also on the other hand, when you ask a question, you can ...

1128
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Yes, but the biggest thing is, for example, this was a project that would be like ...

1129
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Five years ago, the research department and I don't know how many different engineers, now I often do it myself as a hobby.

1130
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Because simply with the models of GPT-3, the context is automatically pre-learned.

1131
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
To actually make a user, more like a researcher.

1132
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I mean, yes, plus it helps me write code.

1133
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
If I need something ...

1134
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So you described it as something that someone can come in quite quickly and start using quite quickly.

1135
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Yes, if I wanted people to take something away from this conversation, it is that time has really changed.

1136
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And technology has really become more accessible.

1137
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Instead of talking about some academic articles that you can study, let's talk about the fact that they are simply tools that you just start using and are completely no-code.

1138
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You know what, a big challenge is that sometimes it happens in front of juniors.

1139
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
AndraÅ¡ will probably confirm this.

1140
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
That people pick up an article, watch a YouTube tutorial, put themselves in the subject.

1141
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Then they come to the service.

1142
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Then you realize that more than that tutorial, people don't have context, background, depth.

1143
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And when these challenges begin, when they start, you have to know how to put them together somehow.

1144
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Here is the part where you say that these people need a little self-interest in the problem and self-research.

1145
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Yes, just self-research and go, for example, look at how the JavaScript library works.

1146
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's probably a magnitude more simple than understanding all these exercises.

1147
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's probably.

1148
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It's pretty much the same here.

1149
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's pretty much the same.

1150
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I mean, no, we just came into an era where these are products.

1151
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Where products are used.

1152
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You use a product to help you optimize a part of your work or beginning, whatever.

1153
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't think there are any such examples here.

1154
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Maybe I would say this here.

1155
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:20,000
When it comes to the use of artificial intelligence, I think that in the past we have focused a lot on the use of examples that are really not exemplary for this.

1156
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And to some extent, if we look at the amount of investment that went into the car itself.

1157
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:36,000
This is a kind of newscast, where the car is driven in almost the entire world at high speed.

1158
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
At any moment, human lives are at risk.

1159
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And one mistake and life is over.

1160
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
High stakes, totally.

1161
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yes, it's full of high stakes.

1162
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It could be even worse, but okay.

1163
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And of course, then you do something and it's 99.99%, but that's way too little.

1164
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And every next decimal becomes a billion, or a tenth of a billion, or whatever.

1165
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:09,000
For once, I would say that the best examples for use are those that can help you do something many times a day.

1166
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And if you do it wrong, you can catch it pretty quickly.

1167
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And then pressing Generate again is not a problem.

1168
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And then you get used to the fact that the system must always be correct.

1169
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And these systems, for the most part, are available today and you can start using them.

1170
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So for people who are thinking about what would be a good starting product for artificial intelligence,

1171
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
or for machine learning, choose some products that are not so high stakes,

1172
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
and that do not endanger your life.

1173
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Imagine a company.

1174
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
For example, a company that has never done a lot of data science,

1175
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
and then it goes into the water.

1176
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And they decide where they're going to apply it.

1177
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
That's going to cost us a lot.

1178
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And then we're going to go into the most high-stakes part,

1179
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
because we want to improve those investments.

1180
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That's going to cost us the most, that's going to hurt the most.

1181
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And then they try to solve this very difficult, very high-stakes problem.

1182
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Every step is painful.

1183
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And at the end of the day, artificial intelligence didn't really get us to the fourth decimal point.

1184
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We were completely disappointed.

1185
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
At the same time, they have someone in the back office,

1186
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
who actually has a lot of time and his own life,

1187
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
to start a completely unoptimized process,

1188
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
so he could totally, simply optimize it,

1189
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
but he doesn't think it's high stakes, and then he doesn't go into it.

1190
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Now that's it.

1191
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
When people talk about digital transformation in the industry,

1192
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I don't know, our industry is out of date, it needs to be transformed,

1193
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
let's first divide what processes you have,

1194
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and maybe start automating those low-hanging fruits,

1195
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
such projects,

1196
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
not first take your favorite artificial intelligence,

1197
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and then go to the most hardcore problem you have.

1198
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Maybe that's how you start.

1199
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I would like them to have a positive attitude towards it,

1200
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
to ask them what they want from life.

1201
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And that's where it starts.

1202
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Can we make this system so that there will be less life with artificial intelligence?

1203
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Now I have this...

1204
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Jesus, how am I going to connect this, Andras?

1205
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I don't know, you imagined it.

1206
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Maybe we should talk a little about the products

1207
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
that use artificial intelligence,

1208
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
and then we'll go there and look for a source and connect it.

1209
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Now I've written down a few of those more well-known,

1210
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
more current products, and some of them may be less well-known.

1211
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I think you know everything, if you don't know anything, we'll be sorry.

1212
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But I think you know everything.

1213
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
The first product that changed this whole part of the space,

1214
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and that really made such a pump,

1215
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I mean, lift for security.

1216
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Lift for security, yes.

1217
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
It's GitHub Copilot.

1218
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
This is a plugin that you get for your IDE,

1219
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and this plugin prepares a code that you write, I think in the comments,

1220
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
and when you write a comment, it offers you a snippet of the solution,

1221
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
you click Tab or Enter, and it fills it out for you.

1222
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
This part is taught on GitHub's repository,

1223
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
that is, all the code that GitHub has.

1224
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Do we know publicly or privately?

1225
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I mean, I know this product pretty well,

1226
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
so it's taught on Mars,

1227
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
it's used in its core,

1228
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
these are GPT-3 codec models.

1229
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
These were actually models that were taught both on the top of the code,

1230
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
and in plain language.

1231
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Then, when it was already taught,

1232
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
it was only slightly adapted to work better with code.

1233
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
But yes, basically, this is a GPT-3 model.

1234
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It started as a GPT-3 model,

1235
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and then it was fine-tuned.

1236
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
You described it as quite simple,

1237
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
quite trivial,

1238
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
more of a marketing tool,

1239
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
nothing special, you could have done it at home.

1240
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I mean, practically...

1241
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
100 dollars a year, or 10 dollars a month.

1242
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You can do it yourself for that kind of money.

1243
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
No, Oto, do you use it now?

1244
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
No, I don't.

1245
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Do you write code with this system?

1246
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
No, I have a lot of...

1247
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You know, it's a bit like this.

1248
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I have almost 200 open-source repositories on my GitHub,

1249
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and in there you can find everything,

1250
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
examples, prototypes, whatever.

1251
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And when I was given those snippets, those cores,

1252
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
it meant that I had my own archive,

1253
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
or that I was giving it to the community,

1254
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
so that people could use it.

1255
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I don't know if I,

1256
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
when I had those 200 repositories,

1257
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and the pull requests,

1258
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
when I gave them all out,

1259
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I don't know if I knew at the time

1260
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
that someone would use it,

1261
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
and that someone would use the GitHub Copilot

1262
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and take my snippets out.

1263
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Do you know what I mean?

1264
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's a part of it.

1265
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It's a part of you.

1266
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
If I write a brutal scale there,

1267
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
my example will be very unique,

1268
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and someone will write,

1269
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I need this brutal example.

1270
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Ultimately, they will take my code.

1271
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Or they will pay and then...

1272
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Not in that way, maybe.

1273
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
No, what...

1274
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Should we go to the picture?

1275
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
No, I'm here with the same problem.

1276
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Maybe it's easier to explain it like this.

1277
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Also, those models for generated pictures

1278
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
were taught on a whole set of

1279
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
such and different pictures.

1280
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
People gave them very different names,

1281
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
and they didn't think,

1282
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
almost none of them,

1283
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
that an AI would learn it.

1284
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
If the AI looks at all those sets of pictures,

1285
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
it learns some representation.

1286
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Those pictures are not stored inside it.

1287
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Only those in the weight

1288
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
are stabilized,

1289
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
or then learned in such a way.

1290
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Then, when you write a text inside,

1291
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
that text is translated into a picture,

1292
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
but it's actually on the basis of those representations

1293
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
of visual concepts that were learned.

1294
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
They are not code now.

1295
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
No, no, that's not the basis.

1296
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
No, that's not the basis.

1297
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I think, for example,

1298
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
for a generated picture,

1299
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
the size went down to 4 gigabytes.

1300
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You know, with those models,

1301
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
stable diffusion...

1302
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I mean, where in those 4 gigabytes

1303
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
are the preserved works of art from all over the world?

1304
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Now, if you happen to find

1305
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
that a snippet came out,

1306
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
which is really very similar to something

1307
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
that you worked on...

1308
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It's beautiful, exactly.

1309
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You can find examples.

1310
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
That's enough for you.

1311
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
If you imagine a distribution of codes,

1312
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
if you happen to know each other in one box,

1313
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
you have a very large company

1314
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
that works on the same problem,

1315
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
most of your representations

1316
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
in that model of distribution

1317
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
were taken out of what you contributed.

1318
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And the rest will be the same.

1319
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Maybe the next generation

1320
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
that you will generate

1321
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
will be a little different

1322
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
than the one you wrote.

1323
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
It's a real problem.

1324
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
There are also models

1325
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
that were strictly learned

1326
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
on codes that have a permissive license.

1327
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
If you published something

1328
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
under an MIT license,

1329
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I think it's hard to convince

1330
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
someone to find a way

1331
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
to use what you don't like.

1332
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But do you think that...

1333
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Maybe at the beginning,

1334
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
when you open a GitHub project,

1335
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
when you upload it,

1336
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
there could be a checkbox

1337
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
that would say

1338
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
how to use the code for Copilot

1339
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and you could have the possibility

1340
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
to do that.

1341
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
In some phases, it will appear.

1342
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
But not now, when we've already done it.

1343
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Let me give you an example

1344
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
from art.

1345
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I think it could be like that.

1346
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I don't know much about art

1347
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and I believe it will go in that direction.

1348
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
For example, in art,

1349
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
some...

1350
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
not so many organizations,

1351
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
but a team

1352
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
that works on one of those

1353
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
big datasets of pictures

1354
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
gave the artist the opportunity

1355
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
to say,

1356
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I don't want to be involved in this.

1357
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
What will be the result?

1358
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
A lot of artists

1359
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
will say,

1360
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
can you please include me?

1361
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Because a hundred people

1362
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
is a hundred miracles.

1363
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And that model will learn that.

1364
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And then,

1365
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
someone will realize

1366
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
that if he writes

1367
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the prompt that leads

1368
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
the model to do something,

1369
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
he can say,

1370
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
give me a combination

1371
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
of this, this, this, and this artist.

1372
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
From those who

1373
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
gave permission,

1374
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
the result will be so

1375
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
that it will look indistinguishable

1376
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
from what he would produce

1377
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
if he said he doesn't want to be included.

1378
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And...

1379
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That's the problem.

1380
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
In the end, a lot of people

1381
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
moved one step forward,

1382
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
because they didn't

1383
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
directly contribute to the learning.

1384
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But when the model,

1385
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
the visual or coding learning,

1386
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
will be able to

1387
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
reproduce the same code

1388
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
in the end,

1389
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
it will be very similar to what they did.

1390
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Well,

1391
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
if that's a problem

1392
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
that will happen,

1393
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I imagine that this thing

1394
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
can end up in a court.

1395
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It already ended up in a court.

1396
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
How did it end up?

1397
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
A project

1398
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
like GitHub

1399
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
or Copilot,

1400
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Antitrust,

1401
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
something like that.

1402
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I don't hope to speculate,

1403
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
because it's more of a question

1404
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
than it really is.

1405
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Look,

1406
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
what would happen to this industry

1407
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
if,

1408
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
let's say,

1409
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Europe, full privacy

1410
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
heavy,

1411
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
if you want

1412
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
to make those data sets

1413
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
that we will train on,

1414
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
and if, let's say,

1415
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Copilot or any AI,

1416
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
you have to explicitly

1417
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
get permission from people

1418
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
to be in that data set.

1419
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Because now it's the other way around.

1420
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Now we download everything,

1421
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
the whole internet, Wikipedia,

1422
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
if you say otherwise,

1423
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
everyone has to give permission,

1424
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
you have a lot of problems in this industry.

1425
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Because you don't have a data set.

1426
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Now I see

1427
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
how are you going to prove

1428
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
that he's in the data set?

1429
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1430
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Like you said,

1431
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
in the end it's all about the weight.

1432
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
He said,

1433
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
it's not the database,

1434
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
it's the TV channel.

1435
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
How are you going to prove

1436
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
that I'm here?

1437
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's the same picture you post on Facebook,

1438
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
it's not yours anymore.

1439
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Let's put it this way,

1440
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
in practice,

1441
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
how many examples

1442
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
where you write a code

1443
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
but don't get a license?

1444
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Then at the other end of the world

1445
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
there's a programmer

1446
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
who looks at your code

1447
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
and writes his own.

1448
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Maybe he's a little biased,

1449
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
a little changed,

1450
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
but in reality,

1451
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
your code was his main belief.

1452
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You won't even know it.

1453
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's not easy to prove these things.

1454
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Sometimes it's so obvious

1455
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
that it hurts your head.

1456
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But it's the same art.

1457
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
People looking at pictures

1458
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
and making their own versions

1459
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
or covers in music,

1460
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
it's like a war in progress.

1461
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It can happen.

1462
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
If we go with strict regulations,

1463
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
it can also

1464
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
lead to

1465
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
this kind of abuse.

1466
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Then people would say,

1467
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
wait a minute,

1468
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I can't draw almost

1469
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
the same thing,

1470
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
because each of them

1471
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
will be similar to the existing author.

1472
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Can this also be used

1473
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
as a counter?

1474
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
In the sense of proof,

1475
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
that you can use

1476
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
artificial intelligence to prove

1477
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
that this is a copy.

1478
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yes, I think

1479
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
to some extent it can.

1480
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's hard to do it

1481
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
with any kind of readiness.

1482
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
How do you look for similarities?

1483
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Semantic or...

1484
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Ok, next product.

1485
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Now we'll go to products

1486
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
from OpenAI.

1487
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It's a startup company.

1488
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Is it still a startup?

1489
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
What did you do it for?

1490
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
When I was doing research,

1491
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Microsoft said

1492
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
they would invest 10 billion dollars

1493
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
in the company that made

1494
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
ChatGTP.

1495
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
These are chats.

1496
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Very expensive chats.

1497
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I think they invested

1498
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
before that.

1499
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Some incorrect data shows

1500
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
that they already invested 3 billion.

1501
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Microsoft puts a lot

1502
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
on OpenAI.

1503
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Clips will always be used.

1504
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Then you'll open Office

1505
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and say, hey, I need

1506
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
to import my books.

1507
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
The thing will happen.

1508
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
The main thing is

1509
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
that they have

1510
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
some data

1511
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
on how to work with Microsoft

1512
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and how to connect,

1513
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
how to share profits,

1514
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
and so on.

1515
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
One thing that a lot of people

1516
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
probably didn't hear.

1517
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Again,

1518
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
it's an agreement

1519
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
that you can't

1520
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
break.

1521
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You can't

1522
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
If they deserve more than 250 billion, it's all theirs.

1523
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes, yes.

1524
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I chose that 75% is paid.

1525
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
If you are interested in the research of the company,

1526
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
google it, it's interesting to know how it works.

1527
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Now, Andras has researched the 4GTP a lot,

1528
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
because he was on some other day,

1529
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and he thought about it.

1530
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
But when I saw the 4GTP and what OpenAI does,

1531
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and when you look at it from a different perspective,

1532
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I have a feeling that in the first 15-20 years,

1533
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
google is starting to take care of their core business,

1534
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
which is search and advertising.

1535
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
There are a lot of things that we can talk about in more detail,

1536
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
but I have a feeling that maybe there will be a revolution in this space.

1537
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And also when you started that semantic search,

1538
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
to open up those topics.

1539
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Do you have a feeling that the guys have stopped a trend

1540
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
that we simply don't have to ignore anymore?

1541
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I mean, looking at the fact that it's only in the media,

1542
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
that it's the hottest topic in the last two months.

1543
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I mean, they're sour cucumbers anyway.

1544
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's interesting to me.

1545
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Maybe it's interesting to OpenAI too.

1546
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
It's the beginning of GPT.

1547
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It's a very slow modification of the GPT-3 model.

1548
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I started using GPT-3 in the summer of 2020,

1549
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
and that's when I experienced it,

1550
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I think, because now there are a lot of people.

1551
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Then after the best efforts for the last two years,

1552
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I was not impressed,

1553
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
and a large part of that time was already available.

1554
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I won't say that I didn't manage to impress anyone,

1555
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
but a lot of people didn't even look at it.

1556
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
It wasn't a big undertaking to try to implement something with it.

1557
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So I would say...

1558
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
More.

1559
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
More.

1560
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
That chat, GPT, is a great example of what can be done with user experience.

1561
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's a better example of user experience,

1562
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
and not an achievement, as for Artificial Intelligence.

1563
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
What was Artificial Intelligence on this topic,

1564
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
it was done two years ago.

1565
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
But when you use it,

1566
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
chatbots like this,

1567
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
and those online assistants,

1568
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
we have now experienced two big leaps.

1569
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
When the scientific world came,

1570
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
around 2000, when all the videos first started,

1571
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
and then when Facebook gave support for chatbots in its messenger platform,

1572
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
and now we have this chat interface again.

1573
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I don't see that it would be that different.

1574
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Chatbots were a total flop, I think.

1575
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
They were.

1576
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,000
The problem was simply the methodology they used.

1577
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It wasn't mature enough for what UX designers wanted it to be.

1578
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So Zadeva tried to understand what IT was,

1579
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
and then she wanted to dive into some of those pre-prepared conversation tracks.

1580
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And we don't talk to people like that.

1581
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
You wrote a track about how it wouldn't work,

1582
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
so I think you're a bit ahead now.

1583
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yes, but for a call center, that's exactly it.

1584
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Of course, it's not.

1585
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
But on the other side of the phone,

1586
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
there's a diagram that says,

1587
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
OK, he's asking about this, we have to answer that,

1588
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
we have to ask him that.

1589
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
If we link it to the product we mentioned earlier,

1590
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
that we massively agitate people,

1591
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and we're looking for these Zadeva.

1592
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
You know, today people are already used to it.

1593
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
They have an icon on their phones, on their computers,

1594
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and they know that if they press that button,

1595
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
an action will take place.

1596
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
You don't know what's going to happen,

1597
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
you don't know what he knows,

1598
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
you don't know where he's going to chase you,

1599
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
you don't know what he's up to,

1600
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
you don't know anything,

1601
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
and you just can't get them to do something.

1602
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
For me, that's what triggers them,

1603
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
that they don't know,

1604
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
and then they start talking,

1605
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
and then we believe that...

1606
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Yes, they're fully self-confident,

1607
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
and they need two hours to talk to the same button.

1608
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1609
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I don't know what that button is capable of.

1610
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Yes, that's right.

1611
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And you're going to be one of them.

1612
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Do you know what that woman, or man,

1613
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
is capable of?

1614
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I don't know.

1615
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Is that possible?

1616
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You ask yourself,

1617
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
what if they start talking about something

1618
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
that I'm not prepared to talk about?

1619
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
That's a good point.

1620
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I believe that for some people it's a problem.

1621
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
For some people, conversations are stressful,

1622
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
and they're worried.

1623
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You know what else?

1624
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
If I don't know what he knows,

1625
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
there's a person there,

1626
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
and if he doesn't know,

1627
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
maybe he'll ask,

1628
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
maybe he'll give you the best possible answer.

1629
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
People will be able to interpolate

1630
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
from incomplete data.

1631
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
You see?

1632
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Exactly, those systems are capable of that now.

1633
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That's why we're going to talk again

1634
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
in a new era of chatbots.

1635
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I actually think that

1636
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
a different term will probably be used

1637
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
to make a little breakthrough

1638
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
in what happened.

1639
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I don't know if it's an assistant or an agent.

1640
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
So a bot has a negative...

1641
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I mean, like a chatbot.

1642
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
That's bullshit.

1643
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Space.

1644
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Yes.

1645
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
They'll use the argument,

1646
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
we've already created chatbots as a company,

1647
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
and they were a total fail.

1648
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And then when one thing fails,

1649
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
and something better comes up,

1650
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
it's hard to reintroduce it,

1651
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
because there's already a bone there.

1652
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I think marketing will dig it up

1653
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
In the end, it doesn't matter.

1654
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Maybe if we just go back to OpenAI,

1655
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
as we introduced it.

1656
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
OpenAI is really

1657
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
the main player,

1658
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
this moment in this area.

1659
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And now, why?

1660
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
What was the thing that differentiated them

1661
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
from the others?

1662
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
They were very comfortable

1663
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
putting all their chips

1664
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
on the hypothesis of scaling.

1665
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And now they're experiencing a payoff

1666
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
for putting it on.

1667
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Because, for example, in 2019,

1668
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
people were laughing at everything.

1669
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
For example, the GPT-2 model came out,

1670
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I was already very fascinated by it.

1671
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And people simply didn't believe,

1672
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I mean, when I say people,

1673
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I mean experts in the field,

1674
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
that if we scale it up a bit more,

1675
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
we'll achieve much more impressive results.

1676
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And that's exactly what happened.

1677
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Because it can go further.

1678
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I mean, with this push forward,

1679
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
does what they're starting to do

1680
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
still escalate even more,

1681
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
or is there some limit

1682
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
to which we'll reach?

1683
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I mean, as far as I can see,

1684
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
we don't know.

1685
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
But if I wanted to bet on something,

1686
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I would say that we still have

1687
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
plenty of room for scaling.

1688
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I don't see us running anywhere.

1689
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Because, for example,

1690
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
in the previous methodology,

1691
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
let's say this deep learning

1692
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
without big learning,

1693
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
it started to show up.

1694
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
For example, in computer vision,

1695
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
there wasn't much drastic improvement.

1696
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I mean, you get up to 98% accuracy,

1697
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
but then every tenth percent

1698
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
is very difficult.

1699
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
But here, it's going pretty well.

1700
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I wrote to myself,

1701
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
this chat GTP,

1702
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I wrote a couple of problems,

1703
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
or challenges that I see

1704
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
with this thing.

1705
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And if you're going to investigate

1706
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
these problems yourself,

1707
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
you'll see them.

1708
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
One of the problems is that

1709
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
when they were training

1710
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
these models,

1711
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
it took some time

1712
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
to build all those models.

1713
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Actually, one.

1714
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And then

1715
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
you have a snapshot

1716
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
of the current world

1717
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
of those models.

1718
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And he doesn't know, for example,

1719
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
who is the current president

1720
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
of the United States,

1721
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
he doesn't know these current things.

1722
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Do you think that if they

1723
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
increase the size,

1724
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
they still won't have

1725
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
the up-to-date world,

1726
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
do you think it will be incorporated somehow,

1727
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
that it will be more alive?

1728
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
When will this be visible?

1729
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I miss that, I have to learn that.

1730
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I think that's

1731
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
a key question.

1732
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So if anyone fell asleep,

1733
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
thank you.

1734
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Yes, really.

1735
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
The current model, I think

1736
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
they all say that it's

1737
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
from 2021,

1738
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
in the fall,

1739
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
autumn,

1740
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
so the data they saw

1741
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
are static.

1742
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And you can't

1743
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
solve it just by scaling.

1744
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I mean,

1745
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
if something happened

1746
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
that hasn't happened yet,

1747
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
you have to know.

1748
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
If you solve it by scaling,

1749
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
it would be interesting.

1750
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
But there are other solutions,

1751
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
which are quite simple.

1752
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So he doesn't need

1753
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
to have all the knowledge of the world

1754
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
written in his notes.

1755
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
That's why it's good

1756
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
to put it in a context,

1757
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
what is the knowledge in the notes,

1758
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and how can we draw

1759
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
some kind of analogy

1760
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
for how people work.

1761
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I will put this analogy,

1762
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and then it will be easier to talk about it.

1763
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
For example, let's take a person.

1764
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
You have a short-term memory.

1765
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
For example, if you solve a task,

1766
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
you have to know

1767
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
what you are doing.

1768
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
If you write a code for a function,

1769
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
you probably know

1770
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
what function it is.

1771
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
That's a short-term memory.

1772
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Then you have a long-term memory.

1773
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
You can think

1774
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
that you remember them,

1775
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
but you can attach them.

1776
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
You can simply

1777
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
use that knowledge.

1778
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
But it's not easy.

1779
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You can either not remember something,

1780
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
or you remember something,

1781
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
or you mix it up with another memory.

1782
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
A human memory

1783
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
is not necessarily the easiest.

1784
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Then

1785
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
you have the knowledge

1786
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
of yourself.

1787
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You can go to Google,

1788
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
search for a book,

1789
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and so on.

1790
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
How does this look

1791
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
in language models?

1792
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Language models have

1793
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
a prompt.

1794
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I think a lot of people

1795
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
have experimented with it.

1796
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's a guide

1797
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
that you give to the model,

1798
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
and then it continues

1799
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
the text from the guide.

1800
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
The guide has a short-term memory

1801
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
logo.

1802
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
That's what the model

1803
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
has in front of it,

1804
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
so it can work the easiest.

1805
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
The role of a long-term memory

1806
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
in models is played

1807
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
by

1808
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
neurons or weights.

1809
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
The entire neural network of the model

1810
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
is actually

1811
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
some kind of long-term memory.

1812
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
But that doesn't mean

1813
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
that models don't have to use

1814
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
other forms of memory.

1815
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Models can

1816
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
connect to the prompt,

1817
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
they can look at the database,

1818
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
they can look at some repository

1819
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
of texts, and then

1820
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
from there, in a short-term memory,

1821
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
they attach

1822
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
information that is relevant

1823
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
for solving the problem they are working on.

1824
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
This is now a mechanism

1825
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
that will support a lot of

1826
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
solutions, but at the moment

1827
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
there is not enough focus on it.

1828
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
People expect that this neural network,

1829
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
if all the information is stored,

1830
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
is not a base.

1831
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I see these models

1832
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
as some kind of glue,

1833
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
because they are complex enough

1834
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
to quickly capture the context

1835
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
and you can put them together.

1836
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
For example, between the problem

1837
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
you have and the data you need,

1838
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
this problem is solved.

1839
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I wrote

1840
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
integration

1841
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
as a problem.

1842
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Today,

1843
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
if you put a table inside

1844
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
and make some connections

1845
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
from that table,

1846
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
probably in such a concept

1847
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
you will connect

1848
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
with other models,

1849
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
with other systems, and

1850
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
extrapolate knowledge from that.

1851
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
This is the kind of integration

1852
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
we see.

1853
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
In a way.

1854
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I'll give you an example,

1855
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
it's quite simple.

1856
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
For example, these models are not

1857
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
good at arithmetic.

1858
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
It's a bit strange, but it is.

1859
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
If you multiply

1860
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
two six-digit numbers,

1861
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
it will probably work.

1862
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
But you can tell this model

1863
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
in a short-term memory.

1864
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
You can tell it,

1865
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
you are not good at arithmetic.

1866
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
If the user

1867
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
asks a question

1868
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
when you think he is

1869
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
exceeding his ability,

1870
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
then you write a Python code

1871
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
that will

1872
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
look for a solution to that question

1873
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
and

1874
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
calculate the result and return it.

1875
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You can tell this model.

1876
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
If you ask him

1877
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
what 2 plus 3 is,

1878
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
then he answers

1879
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
from his long-term memory.

1880
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
He will answer correctly.

1881
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
If you give him to multiply

1882
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
two six-digit numbers,

1883
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
he will write a

1884
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
mini Python function

1885
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
and he will give you the answer.

1886
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I could very vehemently say

1887
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
that you are now

1888
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
a machine for neurosymbolic

1889
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
computing.

1890
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Then there are

1891
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
use cases

1892
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
where you can monetize

1893
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
GTP and PNA products

1894
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
so that

1895
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
companies will use

1896
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
GTP

1897
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
and

1898
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
GTP3 as

1899
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
a core.

1900
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Then they will

1901
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
access

1902
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
their specific data,

1903
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
their

1904
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
use case, or

1905
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
train for their domain

1906
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
that is specific

1907
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
finance or

1908
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
accounting. I think that the most

1909
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
simple use cases in companies

1910
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
will come

1911
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
from this title,

1912
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
in a similar setting.

1913
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You will use it as a member

1914
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
because you will make one process

1915
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
simpler.

1916
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
You will be able to

1917
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
pull out full value

1918
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
from the automation of certain processes.

1919
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
For example,

1920
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
a company has a lot of

1921
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
internal rules and documents.

1922
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Everyone has to follow

1923
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
all of this.

1924
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
This is complicated.

1925
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
If something happens and you as an employee

1926
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
have to react to it,

1927
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
you are not sure what to do.

1928
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
In companies it looks like

1929
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
you start asking around

1930
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
if you know how to do it,

1931
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
and then they ask you.

1932
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Such things can be

1933
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
solved in such a way that

1934
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
when you ask for a point,

1935
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
it will not weigh you down.

1936
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
No, it will do

1937
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
semantic search of all internal rules,

1938
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
search for relevant

1939
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
problems, and on the basis of this

1940
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
it will give you an answer

1941
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
to what is the right thing to do.

1942
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
But you just said

1943
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
that you will ask for a point.

1944
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Yes, I know.

1945
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Again, the use case

1946
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
will be a point

1947
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and you will ask

1948
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
and the database

1949
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
will not be static,

1950
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
it will go through and on the basis of this

1951
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
they will find the best answer.

1952
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And maybe this is what ...

1953
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Yes, but from the point of view

1954
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
of user experience,

1955
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I think the difference is

1956
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
that a private car and a tank

1957
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
are both vehicles.

1958
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I agree that

1959
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
user experience is better,

1960
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
but

1961
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
it's just that maybe

1962
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
you should ask for a point.

1963
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1964
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It's hard for people

1965
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
to understand

1966
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
how important

1967
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
this improvement is

1968
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
that they have their own

1969
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
hands-on experience interaction with these systems.

1970
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
You have to

1971
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
try to see.

1972
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Ok, I think

1973
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I will connect two things here.

1974
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
In machine learning,

1975
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
when we evolve the quality

1976
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
of models, we break

1977
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
the basic inputs

1978
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
on a test dataset,

1979
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
then on a real dataset,

1980
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
and then we look at how much we have

1981
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
done today. And then you have

1982
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
metrics, accuracy,

1983
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
recall, precision,

1984
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
which actually describe how good

1985
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
and high quality these models are.

1986
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And when we

1987
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
talk about machine learning systems,

1988
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
this is very important,

1989
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
because you know,

1990
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
if you have a well-trained model

1991
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
or not so well-trained,

1992
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
it will work differently than you think.

1993
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And now,

1994
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
when I used

1995
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
this 4GTP,

1996
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
when you put

1997
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
some problems in it,

1998
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
which are maybe a little more

1999
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
fringe or a little more on the edge,

2000
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
because there is not much knowledge about it,

2001
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
it still responds very

2002
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
self-assuredly.

2003
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
It responds very

2004
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
well,

2005
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
it takes action.

2006
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
For example, I don't know, you give it a code,

2007
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
you say, make me a code review,

2008
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
then it writes you 7 points of code review

2009
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
and what you need to improve.

2010
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
And then 3 points are real,

2011
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
but the other 4 are total nonsense.

2012
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
But

2013
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
it doesn't say that anywhere.

2014
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
There is no warning anywhere,

2015
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
no confidence,

2016
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
but now I see that people take, for example,

2017
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
the output of these tools,

2018
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
generate, I don't know,

2019
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
a marketing newsletter,

2020
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
or I don't know, a podcast script,

2021
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I don't know,

2022
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
and sell it as a solution.

2023
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And then

2024
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
they push so far

2025
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
for you to take it,

2026
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
that it's amazing,

2027
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
that it's not far from it.

2028
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Definitely not.

2029
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That's why it's right.

2030
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
There are some warnings.

2031
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Yes, there are, but I agree.

2032
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
This is really needed in some way

2033
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
of this model.

2034
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It is not in the spirit of use.

2035
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Yes, people find very creative ways

2036
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
to exploit these technologies.

2037
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
The key,

2038
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
successful way of using it

2039
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
is in integration.

2040
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
If you need

2041
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
symbolic capability,

2042
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
for example, now you have an interaction with Wolfram Alpha.

2043
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
You can

2044
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
use a natural language

2045
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
task that comes in your model,

2046
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
and then

2047
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
it gets the output

2048
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
and communicates it.

2049
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
The same goes for these tools.

2050
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
When you give it a guide

2051
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
at the beginning, it is very helpful for you.

2052
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The answer is

2053
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
based on the things

2054
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
that came from

2055
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
those memories.

2056
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
It can't answer your problem

2057
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
with those snippets

2058
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
and tell you that it doesn't have

2059
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
concrete information.

2060
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
This can be solved

2061
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
to some extent with prompt engineering.

2062
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
You can't use it

2063
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
as a chatbot for launching

2064
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
fucking rockets.

2065
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
You said that

2066
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
you can also write a prompt

2067
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
on your own.

2068
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Then it becomes

2069
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
some kind of art.

2070
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
That's right.

2071
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
ChatGPT

2072
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
has some art

2073
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
where it doesn't go

2074
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
and what it won't answer.

2075
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
But

2076
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
there are people who

2077
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
went to research how to write

2078
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
a prompt so that everyone gets

2079
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
a prompt injection.

2080
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Maybe because

2081
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
it's about prompt engineering.

2082
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
When these models first came out in 2020,

2083
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
everything was in prompt engineering.

2084
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
You could ask

2085
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
in the right way

2086
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
to get what you wanted.

2087
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
But now

2088
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
reinforcement learning

2089
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
with human feedback is being done

2090
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
in these models.

2091
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
We have a model that was learned

2092
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
unsupervised.

2093
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
If we give it

2094
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
a task, it gives a result.

2095
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Then we have people

2096
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
who grade

2097
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
whether the answer is good or not.

2098
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
On the basis of this grading

2099
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
the second model is learned

2100
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
to tell us

2101
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
how a person would

2102
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
evaluate the answer given by the first model.

2103
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Once

2104
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
we have both models,

2105
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
the first one gives

2106
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
the results, the second one tells

2107
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
if it was good or not.

2108
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Reinforcement learning happens.

2109
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
This leads to a model

2110
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
that follows the driver

2111
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
who gave it to you.

2112
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
A large part of

2113
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
prompt engineering does this

2114
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
because

2115
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
the way the model is

2116
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
constructed is

2117
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
to simplify it as much as possible.

2118
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
OK.

2119
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Phew.

2120
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Vlade, do you have anything else?

2121
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

2122
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
No, no, no.

2123
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I have a few more questions

2124
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
and then we'll wrap up.

2125
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Now I will

2126
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
step out of

2127
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
these products

2128
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
and ask

2129
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
the field of artificial intelligence,

2130
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
machine learning, deep learning,

2131
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
the product we have

2132
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
now changed,

2133
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
does this field grow exponentially?

2134
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
The things we saw

2135
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
at the beginning of the year 2021

2136
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
and 2020,

2137
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
and now

2138
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
it's boom.

2139
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Does it really grow?

2140
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Or is it just media talk?

2141
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I went specifically

2142
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
to look for an answer to this question,

2143
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
but the number of

2144
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
research papers published,

2145
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
the number of articles published,

2146
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
the number of codes published,

2147
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
the number of projects published,

2148
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
the activity within this space,

2149
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
everything grows exponentially.

2150
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
And also the tools,

2151
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
their quality

2152
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
is improving almost exponentially.

2153
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Things like today,

2154
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
when we film this,

2155
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
are interesting,

2156
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
but by the end of the year

2157
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
they will be much, much, much better

2158
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
than they are now, because again

2159
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
we have this exponential growth.

2160
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I have some charts here

2161
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
and all the charts go up quickly.

2162
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And now my question will be

2163
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
ok, let's say

2164
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
this hypothesis holds,

2165
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
that growth is really fast and

2166
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
exponential.

2167
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
But now, how does it grow?

2168
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Is it because

2169
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
it's such an interesting

2170
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
opportunity to make

2171
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
a big leap, to really put

2172
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
a lot of money in it?

2173
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Or is it software

2174
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
that enables us to do this?

2175
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Or is it hardware that enables us to do this?

2176
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Or is it hardware prices that enable us to do this?

2177
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
What is the reason

2178
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
for this exponential growth?

2179
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:17,000
In the end, Richard Sutton wrote a short essay entitled The Bitter Lesson,

2180
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:22,000
where he said some time ago that if we look through the art of intelligence,

2181
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
what has been achieved, what has not been, then we draw a line,

2182
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
why did all this happen? It is because all these achievements, in a way,

2183
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,000
were supported by hardware and so much more computational power.

2184
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And I think this is still true.

2185
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:50,000
When we talk about scaling, of course, we will always need more computational power for scaling.

2186
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And in order to overcome this, if we count on hardware becoming more capable,

2187
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
it is not just hardware.

2188
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I will also talk about ways to optimize things with better software and so on.

2189
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
But that is the basis.

2190
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,000
And here, to say that we have a powerful cut-off on the horizon,

2191
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
to see it now, no, no.

2192
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Because no, not only in the individual processor core.

2193
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I am currently very confident that in the next three years,

2194
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
in terms of hardware, we will still grow.

2195
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Unless there is an exogenous event, like a war or something like that.

2196
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,000
But other than that, in the next three years we will still grow.

2197
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Three years of computing isâ¦

2198
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Ten years.

2199
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Fifteen years in some other words.

2200
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
And do you hope to tell us where we will grow?

2201
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I mean, let's say, what will happen at the end of this year for AI?

2202
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
What do you hope to say, where will we be?

2203
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
One thing that is already highly anticipated is the arrival of GPT-4.

2204
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I think that when it happens, it will be much bigger than what it was at the beginning of GPT.

2205
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
It's hard to say what the functionality will be like.

2206
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
My expectation is that the model will be more connected to the Internet.

2207
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It will enable delegating tasks, which I could manage independently.

2208
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Then I expect, when it comes to generating videos,

2209
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I expect a drastic improvement by the end of this year.

2210
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I think we will reach the point where you can generate an entire evening with one shot.

2211
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It won't be the most valuable thing until the end of this year, but look, the next yearâ¦

2212
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:55,000
But here, the video is again about deepfake.

2213
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Yes, you know, when it comes to deepfakes,

2214
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:06,000
we have to find a solution that won't be connected to detecting it,

2215
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
because it's a losing battle.

2216
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I suggest that the solution be more in the sense of cryptography.

2217
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:19,000
So, if you have a cryptographically verified channel

2218
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
through which someone gives information,

2219
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
then you can assume that if the information came from that channel,

2220
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
and I hope so, if not, then not.

2221
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
No matter how you try to detect something,

2222
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
some time goes by, then a better meme comes and it doesn't work anymore.

2223
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
When we were talking earlier, Miska and Muckaâ¦

2224
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Yes, that's true.

2225
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:49,000
What people have shown is that it is possible to manipulate deepfakes quite well.

2226
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So, what is the added value of being able to include deepfakes in a healthy way,

2227
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
is an important question.

2228
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
But I think that more like those media deepfakes,

2229
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:07,000
which would worry me, is when an agent calls you

2230
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
and has a pleasant conversation with you on the phone,

2231
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
or you have a video call with him.

2232
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,000
To some extent, voice already exists.

2233
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
To some extent.

2234
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
It's a kind of a scheme, right?

2235
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Or should I say, they're already here.

2236
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Yes, but what's the point if you won't be able to hear anymore?

2237
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
I'm more interested in whether something is being done against it,

2238
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
that is, whether you will know or detect that it is an output

2239
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
that was generated through an AI system,

2240
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
that on the other hand, it is really a bot,

2241
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
and then record the voice.

2242
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
The Chinese have a great solution now.

2243
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Everything that is generated with artificial intelligence,

2244
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
all images and all photos must have water,

2245
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
it must be generated.

2246
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
They solved the problem.

2247
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Yes, they solved it.

2248
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
You know, it's a new technology, radical,

2249
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,000
some kind of crop picture, you know.

2250
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Okay.

2251
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Now I have two or three more questions here,

2252
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
and then we'll wrap up.

2253
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:27,000
You asked this question, but what is the role of a data scientist

2254
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:33,000
or a machine learning engineer in this whole aspect?

2255
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I think that we will now fight against artificial intelligence.

2256
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I don't know, probably a lost battle.

2257
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
We probably have to learn how to work with it.

2258
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I mean, what is the role of a modern engineer in this area?

2259
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
You see, this question is a bit about the role,

2260
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
what people are doing, and a bit about AI safety.

2261
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
But it's done, it's been mixed.

2262
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
What will you do when you start programming on some scale?

2263
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
We'll write a podcast host.

2264
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
You'll say that today.

2265
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
If you have an idea for today's show,

2266
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
you can generate it.

2267
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
The guy who does OpenAI has a contract for,

2268
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
what did you say?

2269
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
For that, how do you say, universal income,

2270
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
and through that he will give back to people

2271
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
who will no longer have a job because of it.

2272
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
But let's go back to that.

2273
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Let's go back to those vlogs.

2274
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Yes, to the vlogs.

2275
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Well, a data scientist,

2276
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
who was so attracted to the title,

2277
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I mean, still is,

2278
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
but when people join Data Science,

2279
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
they expect to be able to build models,

2280
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
and to be able to get to know a lot of different architectures,

2281
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
which they will use creatively, and so on.

2282
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
But that part is a bit boring.

2283
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Because, for example, in the usual Data Science,

2284
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
the problems in the field are well understood,

2285
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
and the models that solve it are well known and documented,

2286
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
but they don't really need that creativity.

2287
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Because a lot of those people are the happiest when they say

2288
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
that they won't actually do that.

2289
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Plus, there are various AutoML methods,

2290
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
which, even if you have to do it,

2291
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
it's fully automated.

2292
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
And consequently, the role of Data Science

2293
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
is now at two ends.

2294
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
The first is understanding which data we need,

2295
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and are those data okay,

2296
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
and it's very clean.

2297
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Marsik doesn't really care if you promise

2298
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
that you will learn some sophisticated models,

2299
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
but that's an essential part of it.

2300
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
On the other hand, there is communication.

2301
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Constantly, aha, now we got something out of those models,

2302
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
and now we need to show it to the stakeholders,

2303
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
why, and what would be good to do with it.

2304
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And again, there is also a field where

2305
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Marsik is not really looking for that.

2306
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
He would rather develop models.

2307
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Well, now, in Machine Learning Engineering,

2308
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I think that this engineer part came from

2309
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
building something,

2310
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
because a builder of a system that works continuously

2311
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
and has to work really smoothly,

2312
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
and verified, and so on.

2313
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Here it is more about setting,

2314
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
I would say, a pipeline,

2315
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
which will go from, let's say,

2316
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
a business problem or a query,

2317
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
to the final implementation,

2318
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
in accordance with the entire verification that must take place,

2319
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
so that everything flows smoothly.

2320
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
In short, building and maintaining such systems.

2321
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,000
So, in a way, these are roles that are always more divergent.

2322
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Again, it's like that.

2323
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Even a Machine Learning Engineer

2324
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
will not need to spend a lot of time

2325
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
on learning models.

2326
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
For example, what is happening now,

2327
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
where new architectures are being used,

2328
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
whether you are in the universities,

2329
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
where the budget for calculating is very financially limited,

2330
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
and in those development departments,

2331
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
companies that have decided to invest a lot of money in it.

2332
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
And then they have a role,

2333
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
which is now decided again,

2334
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
not only by a Machine Learning Engineer,

2335
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
but by a Research Scientist.

2336
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:30,000
But also for,

2337
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
let's say, for ordinary engineers,

2338
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
because it sounds very stupid,

2339
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
but let's say you are a web developer,

2340
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
that you are, I don't know, a front-end developer,

2341
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
that is, you are not a Data Science or Machine Learning Engineer.

2342
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:50,000
It seems to me that it is smart to be in touch with this technology,

2343
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
because now you have to use it,

2344
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
or it turns into a non-functional thing.

2345
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I can give you an example.

2346
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
For example, someone had an example,

2347
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
that is, he had a plugin that was written in jQuery,

2348
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
and he had some other template,

2349
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
and he put it inside gtp,

2350
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
and he said, write me a React component out of it.

2351
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And the React component was executed,

2352
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
you fix it a little, boom, and it worked.

2353
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
These are some examples,

2354
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
where you have to build a little knowledge,

2355
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
that now this tool will help you improve it.

2356
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
You don't have to be a ML Engineer,

2357
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
but these tools can help you, or what, I don't know.

2358
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yes, maybe a little personal perspective,

2359
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
which can be a little boring.

2360
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
One thing I definitely noticed,

2361
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
when it comes to implementing some such tools,

2362
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
which is GPT,

2363
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I noticed that people who work in marketing,

2364
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
people development, managers, sales,

2365
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
in short, such people are much faster

2366
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
in using these technologies.

2367
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
For example, I don't know, I show it to them once,

2368
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
and then we sit down in two months

2369
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
and casually change it so that they use it every day.

2370
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It seems to me that for people

2371
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
who are more focused on development,

2372
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
it's not always like that,

2373
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
but often you can feel some kind of resistance,

2374
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
and a very strong skepticism

2375
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
about what we can do with these tools.

2376
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I mean, my recommendation is

2377
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
to pay attention to this,

2378
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
not necessarily only for tools that are for development,

2379
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
but also for other things.

2380
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
For example, one side is,

2381
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
which is very useful,

2382
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Future Tools,

2383
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
which is really worth looking at,

2384
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
because it is such a carefully selected set of products

2385
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
that can be used today

2386
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
for solving various things.

2387
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I don't know, I would say banal,

2388
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
how to increase the resolution of the image,

2389
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
and of course, there is also such a tool

2390
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
when the GPTs are up and down.

2391
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I think it will go in that direction,

2392
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
and there will also be senior developers

2393
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
who will use these tools

2394
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
to make them even better.

2395
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Also, if I look at Twitter,

2396
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I will say that people

2397
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
who I know are pretty good developers,

2398
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
then after a few months of using these tools,

2399
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
they recommend that they make them

2400
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
not only very effective,

2401
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
but also that more than a hundred of their codes

2402
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
are created by using these tools.

2403
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Okay, last question.

2404
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Are you ready?

2405
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I was a little shy about that.

2406
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I would also like to know

2407
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
what management is doing,

2408
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
how to connect

2409
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
this part of artificial intelligence and management,

2410
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
or is management now making more different decisions

2411
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
on these tools,

2412
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
or is there a better distance

2413
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,000
and still deciding the way we have decided so far?

2414
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
That's a bit of a shopping question.

2415
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
But what would you say today,

2416
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
for example, to technological companies

2417
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
and their management?

2418
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
The first thing that I think is most useful,

2419
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
if everything is clear,

2420
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
is to get a hands-on experience

2421
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
with these tools for all people in management.

2422
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
You don't have to generate codes,

2423
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
but start using them,

2424
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
take an hour, ask questions,

2425
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
see what you get back.

2426
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I think that this one-hour experience

2427
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
will be worth more than a group of consultants

2428
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
with one-hour posts,

2429
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
to see what can be done.

2430
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
As far as management is concerned,

2431
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
and how it will be applied to companies,

2432
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I think they will be at a point

2433
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
that is not too far away from that.

2434
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Companies will start to appear

2435
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
that will entrust a part of their responsibilities

2436
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
to a dedicated agent.

2437
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
For example, the company Antropic,

2438
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
which is one of the most important players

2439
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
in large models,

2440
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
recently published an article,

2441
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I think it was titled Constitutional AI,

2442
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
where they investigated

2443
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
how you can give a model some rules,

2444
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
or directions, or values,

2445
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
so that it doesn't neglect them.

2446
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Then it transplants other models

2447
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
that are consistent with it,

2448
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
and trains them through it

2449
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
and automatically becomes more synchronous

2450
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
with those directions.

2451
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I think that the company will start,

2452
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
when it investigates new business models,

2453
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
to form an infrastructure as code.

2454
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
We will have a company as code.

2455
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
You can have an orchestrator,

2456
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
in the sense of a COO,

2457
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
who will then assign tasks under the manager,

2458
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
and then he will process them,

2459
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
and in some of those tasks,

2460
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
he will hire people,

2461
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
in others, maybe not at all.

2462
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
In short, I think it will all work

2463
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
more closely together.

2464
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And now, I mean,

2465
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
you can see where...

2466
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I mean, if we go into the engineering world,

2467
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
or some companies,

2468
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
are there some...

2469
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Can there already be

2470
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
a certain part of the workplace threatened?

2471
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Let's say that AI, for example,

2472
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
will replace or halve

2473
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
a person's job.

2474
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
At the moment, my assessment is that

2475
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,000
this is an extremely unused technology.

2476
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
In the sense that,

2477
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
through most of the history of artificial intelligence,

2478
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
we had these illusions,

2479
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
what would be given,

2480
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
then you tried it, and it didn't work.

2481
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Or it wasn't there yet.

2482
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Then, relatively quickly,

2483
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
we jumped into a period

2484
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
when a lot of things can be done,

2485
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
but nobody knows about it.

2486
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Or even if they know, they are sceptical,

2487
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
oh, that's not possible yet.

2488
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
And we have...

2489
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Inefficiency.

2490
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Yes.

2491
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Incorrect.

2492
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
And even if we're talking about

2493
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
general artificial intelligence,

2494
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
it always seems to me

2495
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
that at some point we will have these systems at will,

2496
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
but they won't be used,

2497
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
which will be tragicomic,

2498
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
but it will happen.

2499
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
So,

2500
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
when we're talking about opportunities for people,

2501
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
you have to realize

2502
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
that what will be struggling

2503
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
is this communication and awareness

2504
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
of how to spread among people.

2505
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Let's say that GPT has done a lot here,

2506
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
but still,

2507
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
in a way, very, very little.

2508
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
So, people who are worried

2509
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
about what the foundations are doing now,

2510
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
that it will be automated,

2511
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
they can think about it,

2512
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
and they can, when they start,

2513
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
focus more on the communication direction.

2514
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
To be that connection element

2515
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
that helps people

2516
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
to fill in those gaps.

2517
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Scary.

2518
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Oh yeah?

2519
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Did you think about it?

2520
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
I also wrote here

2521
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
the risk of questions.

2522
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Risk, opportunity,

2523
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
it's connected.

2524
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yeah.

2525
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Maybe that's also

2526
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
the timeline situation.

2527
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
We've already implemented chat twice in our company,

2528
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
and it was a fail twice.

2529
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
People still call the call center,

2530
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
and we hired 60 people in the call center.

2531
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Why, for God's sake, would we have a third or fourth GTP?

2532
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
But technology is probably like that.

2533
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Now you will have a bot, now you will have an agent.

2534
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
But technology is developing,

2535
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
it's getting better and better.

2536
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Yeah, that's what I wanted to say.

2537
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
For example, when we work on those announcements,

2538
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
where we are, and how long

2539
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
it will take us to get there.

2540
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I'm currently working on Metacolus,

2541
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
which is a kind of prediction market.

2542
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
It's a specific question.

2543
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
When will it be publicly known,

2544
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
or I think it will be announced

2545
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
that it is not yet available.

2546
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
For example, artificial intelligence,

2547
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
and then in this question,

2548
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
they say it's a mistake.

2549
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Artificial intelligence,

2550
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
which is only defined that it will

2551
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
reach a certain level of performance

2552
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
on one of the four benchmarks.

2553
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
For example, this year,

2554
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
in January,

2555
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
there was this announcement,

2556
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
which is usually done by people

2557
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
who know something about it.

2558
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
It was in 2042.

2559
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
A few days ago I looked at it,

2560
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
and now it's 2027.

2561
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
We're getting there.

2562
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
No, this prediction may only give

2563
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
an illustration of how much

2564
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
expectations have changed

2565
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
over the course of a year,

2566
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
and I find it interesting

2567
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
to look at companies that make

2568
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
plans, for example,

2569
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
plans for 10 years in the future.

2570
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I don't hope to make plans

2571
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
for 10 years in the future.

2572
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
We're getting there.

2573
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Let's tell people that

2574
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
they should learn more

2575
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
in machine learning.

2576
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
They should find out

2577
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
what these models are.

2578
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
They should be more open

2579
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
to these technologies.

2580
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
We can tell them that

2581
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
there is a lot of documentation,

2582
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
a lot of examples,

2583
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
and that they should not use

2584
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
these tasks too often,

2585
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
that they should become

2586
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
more ergonomic,

2587
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
that there are fewer tasks

2588
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
and that they should be more

2589
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
alert and aware of these technologies,

2590
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
that they are most prepared for tasks,

2591
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
and that it's probably a good time

2592
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
to get rid of these things.

2593
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Yes, I think the time is now

2594
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
the best,

2595
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
it would be even better

2596
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
a day ago.

2597
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Maybe one such

2598
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
general thing.

2599
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Neural networks have

2600
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
a kind of easiness,

2601
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
catastrophic forgetting,

2602
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
or something like that.

2603
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
When you train a network,

2604
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
it adds healthy data,

2605
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
and then you start to train it

2606
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
on a slightly different problem,

2607
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
and it forgets quickly.

2608
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I have the feeling that

2609
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
a lot of people have this

2610
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
catastrophic remembering problem.

2611
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
People start to build

2612
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
some expertise in a field,

2613
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
they draw some value,

2614
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
self-value from it,

2615
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
and it's very difficult for them

2616
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
to accidentally come across a technology

2617
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
that makes that skill less useful.

2618
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Yes, because I didn't learn it,

2619
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I didn't know it.

2620
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Part of it is that people

2621
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
don't program into our habits,

2622
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
and we build

2623
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
a whole mindset around it,

2624
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
and then it's hard

2625
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
to come up with something new

2626
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
if we don't deprogram

2627
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
or start using

2628
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
these new tasks.

2629
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Yes, but

2630
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
there's something special

2631
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
about our industry,

2632
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
that things happen really fast,

2633
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
and if

2634
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
you don't invest

2635
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
your time and

2636
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
money in development

2637
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
and acquiring your knowledge,

2638
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
you get stuck.

2639
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I don't know, I won't have much to say

2640
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
if we don't talk about these things.

2641
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
These are the experiences

2642
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
that teach you

2643
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
that you shouldn't fall asleep.

2644
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Yes, OK.

2645
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Well, I think

2646
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
we should go and eat

2647
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
or something.

2648
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Why are you laughing?

2649
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
What about the viewers and listeners?

2650
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
If you're hungry, eat.

2651
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
If you're hungry, eat.

2652
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
If you're in a hurry, wait a little longer.

2653
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Boris, thank you very much

2654
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
for your time and views.

2655
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Last words?

2656
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Thank you for everything.

2657
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I also told you

2658
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
to watch Endavo,

2659
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
and Karirse,

2660
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
who also has some interesting roles.

2661
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Brendan from SteklaniÄka.

2662
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Yes, SteklaniÄka.

2663
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
So watch Endavo.

2664
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
AndraÅ¾, thank you

2665
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
for your time.

2666
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Jan, thank you too.

2667
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
So,

2668
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
listen to us more,

2669
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
share this with your colleagues,

2670
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
give us some feedback,

2671
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
and see you next time.

2672
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Bye.
