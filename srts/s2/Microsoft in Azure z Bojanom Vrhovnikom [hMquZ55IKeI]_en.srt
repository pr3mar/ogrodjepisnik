00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome to the new episode of Yugrodija, our new podcast with video support.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today we are in Zbranje, in Kristalni Palači, on the 7th floor,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
hosted by Microsoft Slovenia.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today we are joined by Bojan Vrhovnik, Senior Cloud Solution Architect,

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
who has been working with development at Microsoft for 15-16 years.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We invited him to Yugrodija today because we had an episode about cloud and IAC,

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we wanted to hear what's inside Microsoft's cloud,

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
how Azure is developing, what life at Microsoft looks like,

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because we are now interested in what you are starting in this story.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's have a debate with you today, maybe we'll chat a bit.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Did I forget anything?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Great, thank you for coming.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you for coming. Did I forget anything?

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, great news.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
When we were recording, we realized that there is relatively little cloud in Azure.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We both worked a lot with AWS, I worked a lot with GCP,

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I worked with Azure, maybe Azure was a bit different,

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
so that's why we are here.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Great.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, let's start with the introductory part,

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which is the easiest and most difficult to do,

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but I have to ask you to tell us what you are starting at Microsoft.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
As you said, I am a Cloud Solution Architect.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is important to know is that Microsoft has many different types of Cloud Solution Architects.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, you have Cloud Solution Architects that focus on pages,

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and you have Cloud Solution Architects that focus on partners.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My job is related to partners.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What does this mean exactly?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Cloud Solution Architects.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
They say something, but my job is to enable and collaborate with partners

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to enable them for Azure.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Enable it for Azure, as they say.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In other words, to know how to use Azure to the best of their ability.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What does this mean exactly?

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What does it look like in practice?

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Enable for Azure.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's a broad topic, but in practice it looks like this.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, you could say, okay, send me an email with all the roadmaps,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
but in practice it's not like that.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What we are starting with is to say, okay,

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you want to use Azure, let's have a look,

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
first, as you know, let's have a look where you are,

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
let's have a look at what you want to do with it,

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and then we help you with various trainings, hackathons,

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
proof of concept projects, demos, and similar things.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean, we go from start to finish.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I mean, we actually teach them how to use Azure in practice

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
with the best practices we have.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The biggest problem is that people go to azure.com,

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
register, get a credit card, take the first decision they see,

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and say, okay, I'm going to use it.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They get a 100% credit so they can try it.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, that's always the case.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's the same with every cloud platform.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You have the same 100% option,

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
where you have specific devices that are 100% in a specific field,

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then you also have specific services that can be used.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, partners usually have, if they work with Microsoft,

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
we have a so-called partner program,

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and in the partner program they get, depending on what tier they are in,

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
they also get specific credits that they can use monthly for Azure.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What does that mean?

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
For example, they have a so-called MSDN,

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
or Microsoft Software Developer Network,

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
an account where they have $100, $150 a month

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
so they can use Azure for free in their development.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And, of course, a lot of other programs that we have.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We're going to go into more detail,

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
but just to say, partners,

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
are they parties, or are they people who have overwritten it,

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
or are they above it?

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I mean, what does a partner mean?

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It depends, if we look at it.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are they all using Azure?

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, no.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So, partners can also be parties.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
A party is someone who uses your solution.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Partners then use the solution,

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and then sell it forward.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
They also have their own parties that help them,

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
they also have their own solutions that they want to sell forward.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And our task, when we look at partners,

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
is that partners are of many types.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Some are services partners who offer their services.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Some are ISVs, Independent Software Vendors,

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
who develop solutions and then sell them.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Azure has one of its options,

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Marketplace, through which solutions are then sold.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
One way or another.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And then there are the various world variants that exist.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then we have a third type of partner,

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and there are many more.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
For example, cloud is the most relevant,

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
which is called CSP, Cloud Solution Provider.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It says, I am a partner,

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and I will sell Microsoft Azure Cloud.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The other side says,

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I would like to have Azure Cloud,

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and I would like to buy this and that,

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
but I don't know how to work with it.

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And then CSP creates the contract,

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the subscription,

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
sets the environment, helps, and so on.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So there are many different types.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We will go back first.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
In one of my interviews,

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you said you were a policeman.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
To establish my character.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I still have that vibe.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe, maybe.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We will go back to Microsoft.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
when you hear,

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
although not so much,

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
but I am from Tajikistan,

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
so I have two children,

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
a wife and a neighbor's cat,

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
because she is more with us than with the neighbor.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
When I finished elementary school,

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I decided that I would go to be a policeman,

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and I went to secondary school in Tacen.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It was the old one, not the new one.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was a four-year school.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was there for four years,

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and then I went to a police school,

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and I went to work in the field.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Of course, when you wake up in the morning.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
In two months,

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I had some pretty interesting events.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Which you can't miss.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Which I can't miss in November,

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
because you have to respect the work of those

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
who are really in the field.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Anyway,

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
after those two months,

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I decided that maybe this is not for me,

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and then I applied to the Faculty of Computer Science

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and started studying there.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Maybe as an interesting thing,

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
until high school,

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
or middle school,

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I didn't even have a computer yet.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So I was still in high school with a computer.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Imagine,

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
when you come to a first-year faculty,

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you come to a programming subject,

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
there you see a lot of students

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
who are from VEGO,

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
where they had computers,

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and programming for five years.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You don't even know what Linux is,

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
what Windows is,

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
what it is.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So it was a very,

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
very interesting beginning.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now,

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
before we continue this conversation,

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
we have to be honest,

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
we are not Microsoft guys,

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we don't work with Microsoft technologies,

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
so probably...

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, no, no,

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that's not true.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay,

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
but probably we can draw some parallels here.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We are also in an unknown territory,

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
so we can talk a little more.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No, no, no.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We use VESA code.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We use VESA code.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We use VESA code.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We use GitHub.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's already pretty good.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I thought you said VESA Codium.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And C Sharp,

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and TypeScript.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Great.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Now,

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
a little further from what you did at Frio,

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Fax,

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
to Microsoft,

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
did you work in any other local companies?

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes,

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
actually in MIS,

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I started as a student,

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I started at Datalab.

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I mostly worked there as a web developer,

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
so I wasn't just developing a help desk.

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
At the time,

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
there weren't those fancy black and white desks,

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
if I'm not mistaken,

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
at the time,

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
there wasn't any.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So,

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
my job was,

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
maybe this is interesting,

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
how did my interview for that service look like?

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Maybe I'll just put it down.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I came to the interview for the service,

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the director accepted me.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He showed me,

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
look,

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
this is the code we have,

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and we would like to make this help desk system,

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
so that users can see how this whole thing works.

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I looked at it and said,

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
yes,

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can do this in two weeks,

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
even more,

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to use Totnet,

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the technology they wanted to give me,

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
at the time it was a classic ASP.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh,

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
okay.

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Which was,

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
PHP minus minus,

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
as it was called,

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and I said,

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
no,

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
no,

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can do this better,

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and I said,

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
look,

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
if I do it better,

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you know,

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
we agreed on the price,

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want a raise,

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so,

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have certain rights,

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
if not,

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you can't let me go.

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I said,

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
okay,

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
deal.

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So,

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
you have two weeks,

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to do it for me.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So,

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
the raise was really good.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Great.

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So,

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
you have two weeks,

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to do it for me.

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So,

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you have two weeks,

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to do it for me.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Great.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now,

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
a lot of people are probably asking,

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
okay,

254
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I know Totnet very well,

255
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and I work with Azure,

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and there is a lot more Azure,

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
as I said,

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
than the two of us.

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
People are probably asking,

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
how can you then come to

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
some Microsoft job,

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and then you started

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
applying,

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
or,

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
did you work independently,

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to be noticed,

267
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
or,

268
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
how do you get to that,

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to,

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000

So.

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So.

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000

432
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000

So.

437
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So.

438
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So.

439
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So.

440
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So.

441
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So.

442
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So.

443
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So.

444
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So.

445
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So.

446
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So.

447
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So.

448
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So.

449
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So.

450
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So.

451
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So.

452
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So.

453
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So.

454
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So.

455
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So.

456
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So.

457
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So.

458
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So.

459
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So.

460
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So.

461
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So.

462
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So.

463
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So.

464
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So.

465
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So.

466
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So.

467
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So.

468
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So.

469
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So.

470
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So.

471
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So.

472
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So.

473
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So.

474
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So.

475
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So.

476
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So.

477
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So.

478
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So.

479
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So.

480
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So.

481
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So.

482
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So.

483
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So.

484
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So.

485
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So.

486
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So.

487
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So.

488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So.

489
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So.

490
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So.

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So.

492
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The second thing that would be interesting is what we can do with the costs.

493
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If you send someone to Azure and give them a virtual one, will it be overkill?

494
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The second thing is the question we always ask.

495
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What about the availability?

496
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Do they have different requirements in terms of availability?

497
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't understand the question.

498
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I can give them a virtual one, I can give them an Azure one.

499
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Most of them are for service.

500
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That's one part, but that's a very expensive part.

501
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
For me, WordPress is like a platform for service,

502
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
which means that everything has to do with the operating system.

503
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You don't have to pay for a license, you don't have to pay for management,

504
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
but everything that interests them is the application.

505
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In a simple way, you can put it on...

506
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Demo?

507
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
No, WordPress.

508
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
If I go back, it's a platform for service,

509
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
but there are more different solutions that you can use.

510
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
One of them is Azure App Service.

511
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Azure App Service is a web application,

512
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
it's serverless, it has Azure functions,

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
it has storage and similar things.

514
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
For WordPress, we have a very special solution,

515
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
which is WordPress in Azure Web App,

516
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
which means that there is a partnership with WordPress,

517
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
there is a proposal,

518
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
which has the ability to run it on the platform for service part.

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Platform for service means that the management part,

520
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
the operating system, updates and similar things are run by Microsoft,

521
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
so also when it comes to the network and all that.

522
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But you get stuck with the application.

523
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It means that he comes up and says,

524
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
OK, I would like to have WordPress, click, click, click, click,

525
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
he gets WordPress.

526
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He says where he would like to host the base,

527
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
he would like to host the base on the same server,

528
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and he gets too many requests,

529
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
which means that you need to be alive all the time, 24-7.

530
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I need to have, I don't know, maybe I can sleep at night,

531
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I don't need scaling, I don't need more.

532
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So you can install more options.

533
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Now with the platform for service, you don't have the option

534
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
to turn it off.

535
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What you can do is say,

536
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
OK, I will host the application,

537
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
it will be on one server,

538
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
for example, I know that tomorrow there will be a preview day,

539
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and everyone will go to meet,

540
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and I want, for example, if there is a lot of requests,

541
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
to add a healthy virtual environment,

542
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and I can, for example, continue that.

543
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
In this example, I have to choose the way

544
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I will store the data,

545
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
so you said MySQL,

546
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
one option is that it is on the same server,

547
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
but that's a problem if you scale horizontally,

548
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
you need to store the data somewhere,

549
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
where it won't be,

550
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
if one server flies away,

551
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
the base flies away,

552
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
no one will be happy.

553
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And here is a backup of the system?

554
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yes, so you have more options.

555
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Now VWAP has an automatically integrated backup,

556
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
which is stored in the storage,

557
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
or directly to the system,

558
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
which offers the best solution,

559
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
because then you have to connect

560
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
to that server and get the data down,

561
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
which is not optimal.

562
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You also have the option to say,

563
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I would like to expect that it will be,

564
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't know where the hairdressers in Slovenia are,

565
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
but I like the hairdresser Ena,

566
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I think it was someone else,

567
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't know, it doesn't matter.

568
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Anyway, my wife cuts my hair then.

569
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
My wife is my hairdresser.

570
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And I have a webpage for her,

571
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
which scales.

572
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But what I want to say is that,

573
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
if we take the application and say,

574
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
hey, this has to scale,

575
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
then we also have solutions

576
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
that are connected to the server.

577
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We can say, oh, MySQL,

578
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we have Azure MySQL,

579
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Azure MySQL,

580
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
so the server,

581
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
this part has an integrated backup.

582
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It has one thing that is phenomenal,

583
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
which is called point-in-time restore,

584
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
which means that,

585
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
if this part flies,

586
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
you can say,

587
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm interested in what happened

588
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to the food five minutes before 12,

589
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and you can go back to the same state,

590
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
which means that you do differential backups,

591
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and so on.

592
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Which means you can decide

593
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
what machine you will have in the back,

594
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and so on,

595
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
but you don't deal with the machine,

596
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
but only with data.

597
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Now, if we look at this hairdresser,

598
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
what would it look like?

599
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
A person would say,

600
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
oh, I would like to switch to Azure now.

601
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
He goes and says,

602
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
give me WordPress,

603
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
he shows him the options,

604
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
click, click, click,

605
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
he shows him the guide,

606
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
which, of course,

607
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
we have excellent documentation.

608
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In the guide,

609
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
he tells you,

610
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
go to the admin center,

611
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
click this, click that,

612
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and it will export you

613
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
WordPress zip file,

614
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
whatever it is,

615
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
so you have the whole structure,

616
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
imported in,

617
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and he tells you,

618
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
do you want to have the domain listed above?

619
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You say, yes, great,

620
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
choose a domain.

621
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Now, if you have,

622
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
for example,

623
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
a domain on GoDaddy,

624
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it's automatically integrated.

625
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh, wow, OK.

626
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You just click on Azure,

627
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and with GoDaddy,

628
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
we have a partnership,

629
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and it automatically gives you this.

630
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If you don't have this,

631
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
you enter a CNAME or A-record,

632
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
or whatever you enter,

633
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
so you get a link.

634
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Or you can say,

635
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
hey, I would like Azure to give me a domain.

636
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And you get it through Azure.

637
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And I get it through Azure.

638
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And I get it through Azure.

639
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's right, of course.

640
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And all certificates,

641
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
SSL and similar for you.

642
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And when you finish this,

643
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
you're basically up and running.

644
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So, now,

645
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
for the database,

646
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
you say,

647
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
will you have it on the server?

648
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You say, yes.

649
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It does everything for you.

650
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
If you say no.

651
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That sounds like a good job,

652
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and you're good to go.

653
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Not at all.

654
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Because,

655
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
now we come to the story of migration.

656
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Now, we have tools

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
that know

658
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
what you can do automatically.

659
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What do you mean?

660
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You have tools,

661
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
let's say Azure Migrate,

662
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
which is installed on your system.

663
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Now, let's say it works for Windows.

664
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's say a web application.

665
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You do this,

666
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and you do an analysis,

667
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but let's say it's for cloud.

668
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You enter,

669
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
let's say it is.

670
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You enter cloud.

671
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It tells you,

672
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
where would you like to deploy it?

673
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You say,

674
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
great,

675
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'll choose,

676
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know,

677
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
what's closest to me.

678
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let's say it's low-earth.

679
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Amsterdam.

680
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Okay, let's go to West Europe.

681
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You choose,

682
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
it takes you through the whole process.

683
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Finish.

684
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And what you get back is

685
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
URL.

686
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You click on the URL,

687
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and your site is installed.

688
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Let's say,

689
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
okay,

690
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
we don't have these applications locally,

691
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
because we chose

692
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
a Slovenian vendor,

693
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
a WordPress site,

694
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and scaling is not important to us,

695
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
because we are quite small.

696
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Or maybe there are some solutions,

697
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
which are scaled to zero.

698
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That is,

699
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
in some paths.

700
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That is,

701
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
if the thing is not accessible,

702
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
that the replicas are simply

703
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
scaled to zero.

704
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If the thing is only up to one.

705
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yes, we have a lot of these solutions.

706
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
For the most part,

707
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
when containers are used,

708
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
for example,

709
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
there is a variant,

710
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
where they are used a lot.

711
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
We have a part,

712
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
which is called Static Web Apps,

713
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
where you can use storage,

714
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
where you pay for the outbound process,

715
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and you pay for the storage of data.

716
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That is one part of the optimization.

717
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The other part of the optimization,

718
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
if you have containers,

719
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
you have a lot of options.

720
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
For example,

721
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Azure Container Apps,

722
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
which is a solution,

723
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
which is used in the background,

724
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
if you don't have it,

725
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
but if you put it in a container,

726
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
WordPress,

727
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
you can put it there,

728
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and if there is no traffic,

729
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
you can continue,

730
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
no matter what happens.

731
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That means,

732
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
if there are no requests

733
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
for a period of ten minutes,

734
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
you can turn it off.

735
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
However,

736
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
you can also have it

737
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
as a start-up.

738
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yes, of course.

739
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You can have it as a start-up,

740
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and things will be set up,

741
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
or I don't know.

742
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Container Instance

743
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
is a start-up,

744
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
which is used a lot.

745
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The trick is,

746
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
that you have a container,

747
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
which is set up,

748
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and when you need it,

749
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
it is turned off.

750
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And those Azure App Services,

751
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
are they a set of languages,

752
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
technologies,

753
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
that you support?

754
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Where?

755
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Azure App Services?

756
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yes, Azure App Services.

757
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That's what you mentioned,

758
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
about the WordPress.

759
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yes,

760
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
the story behind it is very simple.

761
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It means,

762
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
which team...

763
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I will just add one more thing.

764
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We are not talking about containers.

765
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
We are talking about,

766
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
bring your PHP file,

767
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
and upload it.

768
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes,

769
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
we all understand that.

770
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Platform for service.

771
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes,

772
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
we all understand that.

773
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
We are talking about options.

774
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yes.

775
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
For example,

776
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
App Service,

777
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
as such,

778
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
imagine,

779
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
it is a server,

780
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
which lives somewhere,

781
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and you get access to it.

782
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I won't say the entire server,

783
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
but you can.

784
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But you have access to,

785
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
for example,

786
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to,

787
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
now you have seen,

788
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I mean,

789
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
not Windows,

790
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
but Linux,

791
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but you have access to,

792
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
for example,

793
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
WWW root folder,

794
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
access,

795
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
where you can have more things.

796
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
By default,

797
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
tools are already installed,

798
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
for example,

799
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
you have Node,

800
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
you have PHP,

801
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you have certain versions,

802
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
you have,

803
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
for example,

804
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
.NET,

805
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you have,

806
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
HTML.

807
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Logically.

808
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And now,

809
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
do you upgrade it yourself?

810
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's right.

811
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We have...

812
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Is this WordPress instance

813
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
upgraded by itself?

814
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
No,

815
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
no,

816
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
no.

817
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So,

818
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
we have,

819
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
now,

820
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you have a server.

821
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes.

822
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
On this server,

823
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
tools are installed,

824
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and,

825
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
of course,

826
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
security is the most important thing.

827
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So,

828
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
we are responsible for this part.

829
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You,

830
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
as a user,

831
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
have the option

832
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
to choose

833
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
which SDK

834
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
you want to use.

835
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You can say,

836
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
latest,

837
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
which means

838
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that when a new version comes,

839
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
it will be updated,

840
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
or you can say,

841
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I need 4.7,

842
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
PHP for that,

843
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
because that WordPress moniker,

844
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
whatever,

845
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
for the part that I need,

846
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't know,

847
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
a big plugin or whatever.

848
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But,

849
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the good thing is

850
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that you have all the tools

851
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
that you already use,

852
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
you can also use them

853
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
later.

854
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
We also have integrated,

855
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
for example,

856
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I see you said

857
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
that you are inspired.

858
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
TypeScript,

859
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
we also have an editor

860
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
that is directly,

861
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
the option

862
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that you can

863
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
get a browser,

864
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you can see,

865
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
we call it Monaco editor,

866
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
but,

867
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I don't know,

868
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
you can see,

869
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
you can set the files,

870
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
you can edit them.

871
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You can edit directly.

872
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes,

873
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
yes.

874
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So,

875
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
you can use

876
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
whichever tool you are interested in.

877
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Because,

878
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
for example,

879
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
if we install,

880
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
if there are already pre-installed tools,

881
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
you can also

882
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
add your own,

883
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
if you want.

884
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Aha,

885
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
ok.

886
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This is,

887
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
in the end,

888
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
a server that you,

889
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I will say,

890
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
don't require rent,

891
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
just so that it doesn't

892
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
mess up

893
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
with the management

894
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
of updates

895
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and so on.

896
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ok,

897
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
enough

898
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
about Freezer.

899
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes,

900
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
yes.

901
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I am satisfied.

902
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
What do you say?

903
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What else are you hiding?

904
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't know,

905
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
but I think about it a lot.

906
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
For example,

907
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
normally,

908
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
this Freezer

909
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
doesn't come to Microsoft

910
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
from Slovenia.

911
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
On the other hand,

912
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't know this world

913
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
that well.

914
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I mean,

915
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that something comes

916
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
through those partners

917
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
who have a relationship

918
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
with Microsoft.

919
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That is,

920
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
some revenue

921
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
from PayPal

922
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
gets some help.

923
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
As for some people

924
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
who are not partners,

925
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I know that this is

926
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
more difficult to assess.

927
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But,

928
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't know,

929
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
as we say,

930
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
this means

931
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that something

932
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
is being hacked.

933
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
We are in some

934
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Slovenian community

935
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and we are not partners.

936
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Maybe,

937
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
how do you feel

938
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
about this?

939
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Well,

940
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I mean,

941
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
it is very difficult

942
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
to say.

943
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Although,

944
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
in Slovenia,

945
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
these are the business

946
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
data that I got.

947
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So,

948
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Cloud is used

949
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
as such.

950
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
38% of people.

951
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Which is,

952
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
in fact,

953
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
very,

954
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
very interesting.

955
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
On the other hand,

956
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
those of you,

957
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
for example,

958
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
who are,

959
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I don't know,

960
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
hobby developers,

961
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
but also professional

962
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
developers,

963
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
are,

964
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
for example,

965
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
in Slovenia,

966
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
we,

967
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
all of us

968
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
are in Slovenia,

969
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and we have

970
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
various events

971
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
that are free.

972
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So,

973
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
some are community,

974
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
some are,

975
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
for example,

976
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
third party.

977
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I don't know,

978
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
we are going

979
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
through this

980
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
through the road.

981
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
We are in BTC,

982
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
through the road

983
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
are those

984
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
technological hubs.

985
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And we go there

986
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and we want to sell

987
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
things.

988
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And then people

989
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
come and listen

990
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and ask

991
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
from start-ups

992
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
to companies.

993
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So,

994
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that's

995
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
the connection

996
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
with the cloud.

997
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But,

998
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
on the other hand,

999
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
it's like this,

1000
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
we have a very,

1001
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
very powerful

1002
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
documentation part

1003
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
that I mentioned,

1004
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
which is also

1005
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
very strongly

1006
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
connected

1007
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
with LinkedIn

1008
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
learning,

1009
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
as it's called.

1010
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That was

1011
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
before,

1012
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I don't know

1013
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
how it's called,

1014
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but anyway.

1015
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So,

1016
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
for each event,

1017
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
it's one

1018
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that you have

1019
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
a video,

1020
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and another

1021
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
that you have

1022
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
in the scan

1023
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and how to deploy

1024
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and web app

1025
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
on Azure.

1026
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And you have

1027
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
one option

1028
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and when you click,

1029
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
you can come to

1030
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the documentation

1031
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and you can say,

1032
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
try this,

1033
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and you have

1034
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
a button there

1035
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and it makes

1036
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
a playground

1037
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and you can try

1038
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
this playground

1039
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
whenever you are

1040
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
interested.

1041
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Or,

1042
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
for example,

1043
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
you sit down

1044
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
on the table

1045
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and you can

1046
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
see

1047
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
those interactive

1048
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
tutorials

1049
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
in the sense

1050
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
that you have

1051
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
to go up

1052
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and it really

1053
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
leads you

1054
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
through

1055
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
this simple

1056
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
procedure.

1057
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Or,

1058
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
if you say,

1059
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't know

1060
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
who can help

1061
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
me,

1062
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and we already

1063
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
got

1064
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Microsoft

1065
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
calls,

1066
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and I would

1067
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
like to

1068
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
deploy

1069
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Windows

1070
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
in the cloud,

1071
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
who can

1072
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
help me,

1073
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
we then

1074
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
redirected

1075
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
them to

1076
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
partners.

1077
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We have

1078
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
partners

1079
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
in Slovenia

1080
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
who can

1081
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
help us

1082
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
through

1083
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the process

1084
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
of either

1085
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
development

1086
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
or,

1087
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
for example,

1088
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
various

1089
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
frisbees

1090
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
that you mentioned.

1091
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I also had

1092
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
an example

1093
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
where I helped

1094
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
a butcher

1095
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
to make

1096
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
meat.

1097
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So,

1098
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
it's not

1099
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
just for

1100
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
developers.

1101
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
People who

1102
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
are not

1103
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
experts

1104
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
actually

1105
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
know how

1106
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
to make

1107
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
meat.

1108
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Great.

1109
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So,

1110
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
the next

1111
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
topic

1112
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
we wanted

1113
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
to ask

1114
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
a little

1115
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
more about

1116
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
is

1117
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Microsoft

1118
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
as an

1119
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
organization

1120
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
has,

1121
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I think,

1122
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
over

1123
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
120,000

1124
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
employees.

1125
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That's

1126
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
right.

1127
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
How

1128
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
can you

1129
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
communicate

1130
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
in such

1131
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
a large

1132
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
organization?

1133
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I mean,

1134
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
that's,

1135
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I don't

1136
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
know.

1137
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
For example,

1138
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
that's

1139
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
how

1140
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
you

1141
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
communicate

1142
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
with

1143
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
people.

1144
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Maybe

1145
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
you can

1146
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
get a

1147
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
feel for

1148
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
what it

1149
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
looks like.

1150
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So,

1151
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
now

1152
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
you know

1153
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that we

1154
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
use

1155
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Microsoft

1156
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Teams

1157
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
for

1158
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
communication.

1159
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Microsoft

1160
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Teams

1161
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
doesn't

1162
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
just

1163
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
have the

1164
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
option

1165
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
that you

1166
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
can

1167
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
use

1168
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
to

1169
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
communicate

1170
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
with

1171
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
people.

1172
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You

1173
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
can

1174
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
use

1175
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Microsoft

1176
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Teams

1177
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
for

1178
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
communication

1179
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
with

1180
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
people.

1181
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You

1182
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
can

1183
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
use

1184
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Microsoft

1185
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Teams

1186
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
for

1187
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
communication

1188
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
with

1189
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
people.

1190
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You

1191
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
can

1192
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
use

1193
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Microsoft

1194
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Teams

1195
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
for

1196
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
communication

1197
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
with

1198
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and

1199
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm interested in who the

1200
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
program manager is

1201
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
who deals with

1202
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
the specifications of

1203
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Azure Search

1204
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
because I'm interested in

1205
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
how it works.

1206
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And now I have an option

1207
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
to go to the internal

1208
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
list,

1209
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
which means

1210
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
200,000 to

1211
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
this cut.

1212
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It works,

1213
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but

1214
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I can probably

1215
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
lose my life

1216
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
when I search

1217
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
because it's not

1218
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
logical.

1219
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I mean, it's hard

1220
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
to get.

1221
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You can use it

1222
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and then at the end

1223
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
you go to the art

1224
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
tool and say

1225
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
responsible for

1226
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Azure Search.

1227
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You get it back.

1228
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Can you show me

1229
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't know

1230
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
hierarchy of

1231
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
people?

1232
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Who developed

1233
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
this specific

1234
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
feature?

1235
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And you actually

1236
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
get it back.

1237
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's easy.

1238
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You get one

1239
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
from a thousand

1240
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
people who

1241
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
are interested in you,

1242
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
right?

1243
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Then you just

1244
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
find out when it's

1245
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
available,

1246
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
right?

1247
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Because the other

1248
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
thing is that

1249
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
these icons

1250
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
are available,

1251
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
busy,

1252
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and so on.

1253
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But it's green.

1254
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
No,

1255
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
you're working.

1256
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
When you're working,

1257
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
it automatically

1258
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
changes.

1259
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I also have experience

1260
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
with this.

1261
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
On a very

1262
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
large website,

1263
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
of course,

1264
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
there was

1265
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Microsoft Teams,

1266
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
right?

1267
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And I was there

1268
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
in some development

1269
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
team.

1270
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's a huge

1271
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
organization,

1272
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
a thousand

1273
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
engineers plus.

1274
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And the

1275
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
partner actually

1276
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
wrote me

1277
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
on Teams

1278
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that,

1279
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
hey,

1280
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you know,

1281
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
how we're

1282
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
going to fix

1283
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
this,

1284
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
or you know,

1285
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
get to know

1286
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
these specific

1287
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
tasks,

1288
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and then

1289
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Microsoft Teams

1290
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
actually offers

1291
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
you answers

1292
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
at some point.

1293
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Ah,

1294
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
looking at the

1295
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
conversation.

1296
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yes,

1297
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
looking at the

1298
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
context of the

1299
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
conversation,

1300
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and it was

1301
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
just,

1302
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
nobody knows,

1303
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I don't know.

1304
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It was really

1305
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
funny.

1306
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So,

1307
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I was very

1308
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
surprised.

1309
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yes,

1310
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I was also

1311
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
surprised

1312
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that,

1313
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
well,

1314
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
at the

1315
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
time,

1316
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I was

1317
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
not

1318
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
really

1319
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
aware of

1320
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
the

1321
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
fact that

1322
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
there are

1323
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
internal

1324
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
communications

1325
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and all

1326
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
activities

1327
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
have to be

1328
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
digitized

1329
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
in order to

1330
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
give you

1331
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
a relevant

1332
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
answer.

1333
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So,

1334
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
we actually

1335
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
have a

1336
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
task

1337
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
called

1338
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
dogfooding.

1339
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So,

1340
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
before

1341
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
you go

1342
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
to work,

1343
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
you can

1344
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
try to

1345
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
see if

1346
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
you can

1347
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
actually

1348
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
drink water,

1349
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
invest a

1350
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
lot of

1351
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
money,

1352
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and,

1353
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
for example,

1354
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
in the third

1355
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
or fourth

1356
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
phase,

1357
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I don't

1358
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
know exactly

1359
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
which

1360
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
phase,

1361
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
you actually

1362
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
get access

1363
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
to try

1364
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
it out.

1365
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And,

1366
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
for example,

1367
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
then you

1368
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
can

1369
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
actually

1370
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
get

1371
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
a job

1372
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
in the

1373
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
third phase.

1374
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So,

1375
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
you

1376
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
can

1377
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
actually

1378
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
get a job

1379
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
in the

1380
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
third phase.

1381
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So,

1382
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I think

1383
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
that

1384
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000

1385
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000

And,

1389
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I think

1390
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
that

1391
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
is

1392
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000

1395
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000

1397
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
be

1583
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
working

1584
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
here

1585
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
for

1586
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
a

1587
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
short

1588
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
while.

1589
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I

1590
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
will

1591
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
be

1592
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
working

1593
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
here

1594
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
for

1595
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
a

1596
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
short

1597
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
time.

1598
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
We

1599
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
were

1600
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
not

1601
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
enemies,

1602
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
but also

1603
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
culture

1604
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
changed,

1605
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
so the

1606
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
beginning was

1607
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
competitiveness,

1608
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
elevator pitches,

1609
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
where you

1610
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
could

1611
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
deploy

1612
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
technology

1613
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
in

1614
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
a child

1615
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
or

1616
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
in a

1617
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
helicopter,

1618
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
in an

1619
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
elevator

1620
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
pitch.

1621
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Then

1622
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
it changed

1623
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
because

1624
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
there was

1625
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Windows Phone

1626
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and

1627
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
we

1628
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
took

1629
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
evangelism,

1630
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
but

1631
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
the cloud

1632
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
came and

1633
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
the story

1634
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
changed a lot.

1635
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Then

1636
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
culture

1637
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
changed,

1638
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
there was

1639
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
less

1640
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
competitiveness,

1641
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but less

1642
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
growth.

1643
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That's what

1644
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Microsoft

1645
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
did wrong.

1646
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You don't

1647
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
look at

1648
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
things as

1649
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
problems,

1650
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
but you

1651
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
look at

1652
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
things as

1653
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
opportunities.

1654
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You don't

1655
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
look at

1656
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
things as

1657
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
personal gains,

1658
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
but you

1659
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
grow together.

1660
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Microsoft is

1661
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
a partnership

1662
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
organization,

1663
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
realistically.

1664
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
We are

1665
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
partners

1666
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and we

1667
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
work a lot,

1668
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
we have

1669
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
partners

1670
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and they

1671
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
are also

1672
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
partners.

1673
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You

1674
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
help them,

1675
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
you guide them

1676
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and you

1677
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
take them

1678
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
where they are.

1679
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
If you came to

1680
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
the bank and

1681
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
said,

1682
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
this, this is

1683
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
for nothing,

1684
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,560
I don't know, let's take a look at Linux for example, and let's take a look at Microsoft's server.

1685
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:13,800
We'll tell you, it's a pity, because in the end it's an investment.

1686
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:22,440
So what we did, we said, let's embrace it, let's move forward with the progress,

1687
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,680
let's help people to be the most operative.

1688
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,559
These are two important things that Microsoft did.

1689
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:39,720
The first one was a mission statement, which is a power every investment and every person on the planet achieves more.

1690
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,680
And here you can see everything we have, what we're doing, the innovation, the acquisitions.

1691
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,200
You can see that it's all about productivity.

1692
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,680
If you're productive, you've seen it a lot in Corona.

1693
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:02,680
In the end, you can change from one hour, I mean, from one day, you can become digital.

1694
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,680
You can work from home, in a limited way and so on.

1695
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,400
And here, for example, the culture has also changed a lot in Microsoft.

1696
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,680
And I see that as the biggest leap.

1697
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:24,680
So instead of being an adversary, you're actually a help with, a companion, as you would call it, I don't know.

1698
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:35,680
Now, last year, we had a conversation with Dr. Cergol from ENDAVE, who deals with Artificial Intelligence.

1699
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:54,680
We heard about ChatGTP, then a week or two ago, the debate with Bing, Panica, Marketingers are really excited about all of this.

1700
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,680
You even wrote AI Wars.

1701
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:08,679
Do you think there will be a fork on the road again?

1702
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,679
I mean, Microsoft is always innovating, in all of its variants.

1703
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:21,679
What you mentioned, AI Wars, Bing, Edge, etc.

1704
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:23,679
These are things we've already changed.

1705
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,679
In fact, AI is not a new thing.

1706
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,679
Maybe it's just as relevant now.

1707
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,679
It's become more visible.

1708
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:32,679
That's right, it's become more visible.

1709
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:40,679
For example, before we invested in OpenAI, we started with AI as a platform.

1710
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:43,679
You have a business called Cognitive Services.

1711
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,679
Cognitive Services is your translator.

1712
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,679
You can use Bing, which means Search, Images, you can use all of these things.

1713
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:59,679
Before that, people were like, you have Bing, you have Chat, you can work with that.

1714
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:10,679
A few years ago, we had a bot framework, where you could take a reward and create your own bot.

1715
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,679
But it didn't work before.

1716
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:14,679
Of course it did.

1717
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:21,679
I think the main thing that happened here is that we are not the only three here,

1718
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:23,679
because we are behind it.

1719
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,679
We understand how it works, but there is a very wide audience,

1720
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:32,679
and they are very surprised.

1721
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:44,679
In the end, I think we all know that the answers from various AI systems are very confident,

1722
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,679
but they also know a lot of stuff.

1723
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:48,679
After all, technology is still technology.

1724
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:51,679
It's impressive where we are heading.

1725
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:53,679
For example, it was very impressive to me,

1726
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:58,679
because now everyone is talking about language models and all the variants,

1727
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:01,679
and everyone is interested in what is happening behind it.

1728
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,679
I am not an expert in data and AI,

1729
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:14,679
but as a developer, I have already used the Language Understanding Intelligent System,

1730
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:16,679
known as LUIS.

1731
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:20,679
At that time, as a developer, because I didn't know these things,

1732
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:23,679
I said, look, go to this website.

1733
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:27,679
This might be an interesting anecdote, if I can say it quickly.

1734
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:34,679
Imagine, I had a lecture, I mean a meeting,

1735
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:38,679
where we went through how a bot is built.

1736
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:41,679
One of the options that LUIS has is that you can tell it,

1737
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,679
ok, these are all the things you are learning on the basis of,

1738
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,679
or you had an option where you told it, look, this is a website,

1739
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,679
and from this website you make a crawler, which is something normal,

1740
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:57,679
and it finds all the information that is interesting,

1741
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:59,679
and it does it from a knowledge base.

1742
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:04,679
And then we had this lecture, and the co-worker did it,

1743
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:08,679
and we had questions, and one of them said,

1744
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:11,679
yes, but this is not true, and he said,

1745
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,679
and he told himself,

1746
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,679
and he said, I didn't understand it,

1747
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,679
and I said, yes, but this is from your side,

1748
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:21,679
how do you think about it, from this and this and this part.

1749
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,679
So, communication showed him,

1750
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:28,679
in what way we were able to get this information back in one hour,

1751
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:31,679
already at that time, using all these technologies,

1752
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,679
so it was very impressive.

1753
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:36,679
The other thing is, for example,

1754
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,679
most of the sites I work on now,

1755
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:43,679
I automatically integrate Azure Search as a cognitive service,

1756
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,679
which means that it does, because you have this free option,

1757
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,679
it does, it goes through all these options,

1758
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,679
it creates an index, and then it has all these functionalities at will,

1759
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:54,679
but I, as a developer of this,

1760
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:56,679
I don't know, for example,

1761
00:55:56,679 --> 00:55:59,679
this algorithm, the second algorithm, the third algorithm,

1762
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:01,679
but what do you do, you take the service,

1763
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,679
click, click, click, click,

1764
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:06,679
you log in, and it starts working as it should.

1765
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:08,679
And this is, for example, this productivity,

1766
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:10,679
which is so much for the EFAM,

1767
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:12,679
you can see it, for example,

1768
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:14,679
Bing, if you look at it, and chat,

1769
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:16,679
and everything starts working.

1770
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:19,679
The only enhancement of this is to use it.

1771
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,679
What people have seen now,

1772
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,679
is the practical use of what used to be one-time,

1773
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:27,679
but if you now combine it with someone else,

1774
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,679
you used to have it as a decision.

1775
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:31,679
I think a lot of money has been spent

1776
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,679
to make these things work,

1777
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:35,679
because this computing power

1778
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:37,679
that we are using to drive it,

1779
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:39,679
is expensive.

1780
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,679
Could developers be a little more ambitious,

1781
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:43,679
and use,

1782
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:46,679
if now Azure has 200-300 services,

1783
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:48,679
could they be a little more ambitious,

1784
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:51,679
and look at the most uncommon things,

1785
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,679
and look at the various AI,

1786
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,679
various audio things,

1787
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,679
because I think, I don't know,

1788
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:59,679
now I have a feeling that Mars,

1789
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:01,679
which thing is already very well done,

1790
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:03,679
but I think there is a lot of potential

1791
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:05,679
for these things to merge together

1792
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:07,679
and make some product,

1793
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,679
maybe even more in the Slovenian space,

1794
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:11,679
which is perhaps a little smaller.

1795
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,679
Let's talk about Slovenia.

1796
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:17,679
We had,

1797
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:19,679
and we still have,

1798
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,679
these various hackathons,

1799
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,679
where we experimented

1800
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:25,679
to use different things.

1801
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:27,679
We had, for example,

1802
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,679
sales where fans said,

1803
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,679
this is all you have,

1804
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:33,679
these are vouchers

1805
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,679
that you can use for $100,

1806
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:37,679
and then you see.

1807
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:39,679
Now, this is an answer to the question,

1808
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:44,679
that there could be more ambitious developers.

1809
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:46,679
Now the question is,

1810
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:48,679
what does a developer need?

1811
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,679
What does it mean,

1812
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,679
do you want to be a developer,

1813
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:54,679
solve a problem,

1814
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,679
and then you don't look at it,

1815
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,679
will you use a service,

1816
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:00,679
or will you use virtual?

1817
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,679
Then you have developers,

1818
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,679
for example, who are very,

1819
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:06,679
they are very afraid,

1820
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:08,679
on the basis of what I do with them,

1821
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:10,679
on the basis of a service,

1822
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:12,679
because then they will be trapped

1823
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,679
on that specific service.

1824
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:16,679
They always look for some variants,

1825
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:18,679
what will I look for,

1826
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:20,679
if I want to stop very quickly,

1827
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,679
now if I use a computer,

1828
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:24,679
then I have no end.

1829
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:26,679
Here we come to these architectures,

1830
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:28,679
where we talk in a hybrid cloud,

1831
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,679
which is also one such variant,

1832
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:32,679
which is also a hot potato lately,

1833
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,679
which everyone likes,

1834
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:36,679
hybrid models and so on.

1835
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,679
In other words,

1836
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:40,679
it's not a mistake to try,

1837
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:42,679
you go up, try,

1838
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:44,679
see if it suits you,

1839
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,679
because in the end it is always like this,

1840
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:48,679
most of those students who went up

1841
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:50,679
solved 90% of the problem,

1842
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:52,679
10% of the problem,

1843
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:54,679
which is there,

1844
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:56,679
is in the details,

1845
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:58,679
because it is exactly the same details

1846
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:00,679
that ultimately lead to problems.

1847
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:02,679
Now, for example,

1848
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:04,679
when I do demos,

1849
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:06,679
workshops and similar things,

1850
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,679
I have always shown two variants.

1851
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,679
One is to use a service

1852
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:12,679
to see how easy it is

1853
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,679
to do it,

1854
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:16,679
then from scratch,

1855
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,679
I mean from scratch,

1856
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:20,679
use it in a different way,

1857
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:22,679
so that they see,

1858
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:24,679
okay, it's okay,

1859
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:26,679
I can achieve the same,

1860
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:28,679
but I will be able to do

1861
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:30,679
so much, so much, so much investment.

1862
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:32,679
Then they have to calculate

1863
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:34,679
what their total cost of ownership is,

1864
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:36,679
how it actually works,

1865
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,679
but the point is that

1866
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:40,679
the more you try differently,

1867
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:42,679
the more it doesn't make sense.

1868
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,679
I agree.

1869
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:46,679
We often have this debate

1870
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:48,679
that in the end you hire three people

1871
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:50,679
who pay a lot of money,

1872
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:52,679
get a lot of supervisors

1873
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:54,679
who amortize themselves,

1874
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:56,679
and a lot of guards

1875
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:58,679
who we often don't understand,

1876
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,679
if they would take

1877
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:02,679
the whole infrastructure

1878
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:04,679
for the service,

1879
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:06,679
I think they could

1880
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:08,679
achieve more.

1881
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:10,679
There are examples where it doesn't work,

1882
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:12,679
but I think that in our community

1883
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:14,679
there is a lot of people

1884
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,679
who don't trust

1885
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,679
or don't do the cost-benefit analysis.

1886
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:22,679
Now I will introduce

1887
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:24,679
two other examples.

1888
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:26,679
Let's go to this example.

1889
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:28,679
Okay.

1890
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:30,679
We have two examples.

1891
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:32,679
One is quite difficult.

1892
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:34,679
Let's go to Slovenian pride.

1893
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:36,679
Slovenian pride?

1894
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:38,679
We won't talk about pharmaceutical companies

1895
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,679
or energy companies,

1896
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,679
but we will talk about the

1897
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:44,679
manufacturing industry.

1898
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:46,679
Something domestic.

1899
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:48,679
Example two.

1900
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,679
Kranjska kolbasa goes to...

1901
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:52,679
Oops.

1902
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:54,679
Okay.

1903
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:56,679
She is getting serious.

1904
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:58,679
This is a company,

1905
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:00,679
fictitious again,

1906
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:02,679
which deals with

1907
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:04,679
domestic products

1908
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:06,679
in Slovenia,

1909
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:08,679
but most of the time

1910
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:10,679
it is bought by a pharmaceutical company.

1911
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:12,679
They wanted to modernize

1912
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:14,679
and upgrade their production.

1913
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:16,679
Most of them were employed.

1914
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:18,679
Maybe they wanted to add an employee.

1915
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,679
They got

1916
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:22,679
some investments.

1917
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,679
100 employees.

1918
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:26,679
Three servers.

1919
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:28,679
Seven years old.

1920
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:30,679
Amortized for a long time.

1921
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:32,679
We have already paid for extended warranty.

1922
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:34,679
Yes, but

1923
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:36,679
we would leave everything for later.

1924
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:38,679
Then we have three servers

1925
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:40,679
on which we have

1926
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:42,679
specific orders.

1927
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:44,679
Then we have

1928
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:46,679
an open source system

1929
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:48,679
20 years old.

1930
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:50,679
Whatever.

1931
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:52,679
Then we have

1932
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:54,679
some hardware.

1933
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:56,679
20 workstations,

1934
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,679
20 office phones.

1935
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:00,679
A close-up picture.

1936
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,679
The investor

1937
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:04,679
invested 10 million.

1938
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,679
Of course,

1939
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,679
it goes in the transition line,

1940
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:10,679
but he decided

1941
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:12,679
to invest 1 million

1942
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:14,679
in the next

1943
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:16,679
three to five years

1944
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:18,679
in digitalization

1945
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:20,679
or reducing the risk of

1946
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:22,679
a budget of 1 million

1947
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,679
in three to five years.

1948
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:26,679
We'll see what happens

1949
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:28,679
after that.

1950
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,679
It's all thought out.

1951
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:32,679
Would you give it to your partners

1952
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:34,679
to work on?

1953
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:36,679
Yes.

1954
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:38,679
It's not a partner.

1955
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:40,679
It's a party.

1956
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:44,679
Everything is different.

1957
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,679
Even if a partner works,

1958
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,679
we help

1959
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:50,679
our partners.

1960
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:52,679
The first thing

1961
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:54,679
to do is

1962
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:56,679
to have

1963
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:58,679
a Cloud Adoption Framework.

1964
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:00,679
A Cloud Adoption Framework

1965
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:02,679
is

1966
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,679
a tool

1967
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:06,679
that

1968
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:08,679
we use

1969
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:10,679
to improve

1970
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:12,679
the practice of

1971
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:14,679
migration.

1972
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,679
With these migrations,

1973
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:18,679
the question is

1974
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:20,679
not only

1975
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:22,679
to migrate,

1976
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:24,679
but to decide

1977
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,679
what goes

1978
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:28,679
and what doesn't.

1979
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,679
How do we do that?

1980
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:32,679
The Cloud Adoption Framework

1981
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,679
has four phases.

1982
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,679
The first one is a strategy discussion.

1983
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,679
We ask

1984
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:40,679
for example,

1985
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:42,679
what exactly

1986
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:44,679
do they want to achieve?

1987
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:46,679
I'll give you an example.

1988
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:48,679
We had

1989
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:50,679
a partnership.

1990
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:52,679
It was a real partnership.

1991
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:54,679
We had a partner

1992
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:56,679
who was

1993
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:58,679
an analyst.

1994
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:00,679
He knew

1995
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:02,679
his partner very well.

1996
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:06,679
He said,

1997
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:08,679
for the first time,

1998
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,679
he will show us

1999
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:12,679
how the Cloud Adoption Framework works.

2000
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,679
He will call

2001
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:16,679
his partner

2002
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:18,679
and she will answer your questions.

2003
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:20,679
We learned how it works.

2004
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:22,679
He said,

2005
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:24,679
they just want to migrate a couple of virtual machines.

2006
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:26,679
They want to have a base

2007
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:28,679
and connect to the cloud.

2008
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:30,679
The partner comes

2009
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:32,679
and we start with the questions.

2010
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:34,679
The questions we ask

2011
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:36,679
are, what are your motivations?

2012
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:38,679
Everything is documented.

2013
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:40,679
We have tools

2014
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:42,679
in the framework

2015
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,679
that you use to answer

2016
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:46,679
the questions.

2017
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:48,679
Why do you want to migrate to the cloud?

2018
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:50,679
What are your current needs?

2019
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,679
Where do you see challenges?

2020
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:54,679
What do you want to achieve?

2021
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:56,679
What are your final goals?

2022
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:58,679
Here, you need

2023
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:00,679
a lot of people

2024
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,679
to see

2025
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:04,679
where you are going.

2026
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:06,679
The example I mentioned

2027
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:08,679
was that the partner

2028
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:10,679
at the end of the question

2029
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:12,679
is always green.

2030
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:14,679
In the end, he realized

2031
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:16,679
that he wanted to migrate

2032
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,679
a virtual machine.

2033
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:20,679
He wanted to go to the services

2034
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:22,679
because he wanted

2035
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:24,679
to be able to pay

2036
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:26,679
a certain number of employees.

2037
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:28,679
He had no idea

2038
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:30,679
because he only talked

2039
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:32,679
to the IT department.

2040
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,679
He didn't talk to the finance minister.

2041
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:36,679
He didn't talk to other people.

2042
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:38,679
This is the first part

2043
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:40,679
where you talk.

2044
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:42,679
What exactly is the goal?

2045
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:44,679
The goal is to modernize

2046
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:46,679
and to go to the cloud.

2047
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:48,679
The first thing

2048
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:50,679
we need to do

2049
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,679
is to know

2050
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:54,679
what the cloud means.

2051
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:56,679
If you don't know

2052
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:58,679
what you are going to use,

2053
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:00,679
that's the point.

2054
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:02,679
On the other hand,

2055
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:04,679
if you say

2056
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:06,679
that you don't care

2057
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:08,679
and you know what to do,

2058
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,679
but in practice everyone

2059
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,679
who has a business will want to know

2060
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:14,679
what is going on with it.

2061
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,679
That's why the key people

2062
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:18,679
who decided at the beginning

2063
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:20,679
are represented.

2064
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:22,679
We call it the organization.

2065
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,679
In practice,

2066
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:26,679
I will use a fax from RAS.

2067
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:28,679
It's a RACI matrix.

2068
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:30,679
Responsible, accountable,

2069
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:32,679
consulted, informed.

2070
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:34,679
Good knowledge, good decisions,

2071
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:36,679
good knowledge.

2072
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:38,679
Who deals with governance?

2073
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:40,679
Who will make sure

2074
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:42,679
that everything fits

2075
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:44,679
the company's policies?

2076
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:46,679
For example,

2077
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:48,679
we have changed everything.

2078
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:50,679
I was very happy

2079
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:52,679
that two days ago

2080
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,679
Sestanek came.

2081
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:56,679
We are moving to Sestanek.

2082
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,679
Sestanek came from

2083
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,679
finance.

2084
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:02,679
He is a chief financial officer.

2085
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:04,680
He said,

2086
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,680
no, these tasks will stay here

2087
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,680
because they are bad financial data

2088
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,680
that we don't want

2089
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,680
and we don't want them to go anywhere.

2090
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,680
Everything that we talked about

2091
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,680
for two weeks went down the drain.

2092
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,680
Thank God, it was only two weeks.

2093
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,680
After this decision,

2094
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,680
people are represented

2095
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,680
so that they know what is going on.

2096
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,680
The third thing that is done is assessment.

2097
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,680
Assessment is done in the following way.

2098
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,680
First, the decision is made

2099
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,680
to see what we have.

2100
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,680
An inventory environment is made.

2101
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,680
You look at it

2102
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,680
and we have a lot of tools for that.

2103
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,680
For example,

2104
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,680
what is very interesting,

2105
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,680
we use DevOps for all these tasks.

2106
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,680
We have our own solutions.

2107
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,680
As you know, we have GitHub,

2108
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,680
but we also have Azure DevOps.

2109
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,680
In Azure DevOps,

2110
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,680
we have a generator that generates

2111
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,680
proposals,

2112
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,680
structures, everything you need

2113
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,680
so that you can go to DevOps

2114
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,680
and use this additional framework.

2115
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,680
For example, questions,

2116
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,680
links, sentences, scripts,

2117
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,680
everything you need

2118
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,680
so that you have it all in one place

2119
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,680
and then you run the whole project

2120
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,680
as if it were a programming thing.

2121
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,680
Assessment is done.

2122
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,680
When you prepare it,

2123
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,680
you can do it in many ways.

2124
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,680
For example,

2125
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,680
it usually looks like this

2126
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,680
Excel gives it to you.

2127
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,680
This is Excel.

2128
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,680
This is, for example,

2129
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,680
fast storage 1 server,

2130
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,680
fast storage 2 server,

2131
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,680
and similar things.

2132
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,680
You look at the server and see

2133
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,680
8 cores,

2134
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,680
16GB of RAM,

2135
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,680
32GB of RAM,

2136
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,680
a lot of disks,

2137
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,680
but in reality,

2138
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,680
do they really use it?

2139
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,680
No, you don't know if they really use it.

2140
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,680
All 8 cores can be used,

2141
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,680
only 2.

2142
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,680
They can use it for 6 hours.

2143
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,680
How to do it?

2144
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,680
This is something that we use

2145
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,680
as a second tool.

2146
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,680
When you prepare

2147
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,680
the whole organization,

2148
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,680
what happens if you know

2149
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,680
how many people are involved,

2150
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,680
not only do you ask people

2151
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,680
in their inventory,

2152
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,680
but you can also scan them

2153
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,680
so that you can prepare

2154
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,680
the real situation

2155
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,680
between those who work.

2156
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,680
In practice,

2157
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,680
most people

2158
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,680
do overprovisioning,

2159
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,680
others do one-on-one mapping,

2160
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,680
which is very consumer-friendly.

2161
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,680
Why?

2162
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,680
Because if you take a website

2163
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,680
and it's full-time for one week,

2164
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,680
and the next week

2165
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,680
it's all over,

2166
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,680
it doesn't make sense

2167
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,680
to have a server

2168
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,680
with 8 cores and 32 GB RAM

2169
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,680
because you'll pay a lot for it

2170
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,680
and you won't need it in the end.

2171
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,680
That's where the advantage

2172
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,680
of the cloud comes in.

2173
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,680
You can change it.

2174
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,680
For example,

2175
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,680
we'll have 5 servers

2176
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,680
and we'll need

2177
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,680
servers that are

2178
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,680
available.

2179
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,680
We call them spot machines

2180
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,680
or B-series machines,

2181
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,680
which will work

2182
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,680
as fast

2183
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,680
and effective

2184
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,680
and then

2185
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,680
idle.

2186
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,680
For example,

2187
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,680
in practice,

2188
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,680
you have financial management.

2189
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,680
I won't say they're in the cloud

2190
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,680
because I don't know

2191
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,680
but for them it would be

2192
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,680
a perfect example.

2193
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,680
Twice a year,

2194
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,680
they have a deadline.

2195
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,680
That's how the whole of Slovenia

2196
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,680
works.

2197
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,680
If you cover it up,

2198
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,680
you need a huge server.

2199
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,680
You have an assessment

2200
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,680
based on the tools you can use.

2201
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,680
We call them Azure Magritte

2202
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,680
and Azure Magritte is based on

2203
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,680
tools that are Microsoft specific.

2204
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,680
For example,

2205
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,680
you gave me an example

2206
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,680
of a virtual machine

2207
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,680
and a couple of servers

2208
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,680
on a website.

2209
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,680
What's really nice

2210
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,680
is that if we use a Microsoft version,

2211
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,680
it's installed

2212
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,680
on the datacenter

2213
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,680
they have,

2214
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,680
and it's ready for a month

2215
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,680
and you get

2216
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,680
an Excel report

2217
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,680
so you can see

2218
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,680
exactly how many requests

2219
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,680
and IOPs there were.

2220
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,680
Then they give you a proposal

2221
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,680
and say this would be the best

2222
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,680
version in Azure.

2223
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,680
As a cloud solution architect,

2224
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,680
we never believe that,

2225
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,680
because it's obvious.

2226
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,680
Most of them give you

2227
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,680
specific examples

2228
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,680
and that's great,

2229
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,680
but they always respect

2230
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,680
the highest level.

2231
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,680
For example, this was Medium.

2232
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,680
So they always respect

2233
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,680
Medium.

2234
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,680
Then you can use Lodmin

2235
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,680
and that's why it's important to have

2236
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,680
a list of people

2237
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,680
and ask them

2238
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,680
what exactly

2239
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,680
is being done on this server.

2240
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,680
Then you can say

2241
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,680
if that's important.

2242
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,680
If you talk

2243
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,680
during an assessment

2244
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,680
about NSDB

2245
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,680
that we call 5 hours,

2246
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
5 hours means

2247
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,680
re-host,

2248
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,680
re-place, re-tire,

2249
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,680
re-main,

2250
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,680
re-retain,

2251
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,680
re-tire.

2252
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,680
Retire means

2253
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,680
I have a datacenter

2254
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,680
and the datacenter

2255
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,680
has a jumpbox

2256
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,680
so you can connect to the server.

2257
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,680
You don't need that in Azure.

2258
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,680
Do you really need to transfer

2259
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,680
that server to the cloud?

2260
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,680
Obviously not.

2261
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,680
Do you need a server that

2262
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,680
scans the data?

2263
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Do you need it?

2264
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,680
Azure has solutions for that.

2265
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,680
Then you can say

2266
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,680
if it's re-tire, re-host,

2267
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,680
or re-imagine.

2268
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,680
Whatever you want to call it.

2269
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,680
Okay.

2270
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,680
That's a great answer.

2271
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,680
It's great that it's normal.

2272
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,680
For example,

2273
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,680
why I don't work with Slovenian

2274
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,680
parties is because

2275
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,680
I have too little identity

2276
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,680
to be able to listen to

2277
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,680
those conversations.

2278
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,680
It's weird that in Tuino

2279
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,680
it's easier to have some

2280
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,680
mature conversations.

2281
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,680
After all, technology is

2282
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,680
very experienced.

2283
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,680
If you've been in the industry

2284
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,680
for 15 years,

2285
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,680
it's easy to decide

2286
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,680
which party wants to be

2287
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,680
aligned, champion,

2288
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,680
and have them in an organization.

2289
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,680
That's the hardest part.

2290
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,680
We've decided that

2291
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,680
we want to be able to

2292
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,680
expose our business decisions

2293
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,680
in the cloud.

2294
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,680
That's our recipe.

2295
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,680
We've decided

2296
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,680
that there are definitely

2297
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,680
two things we'd like to

2298
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,680
add to the cloud.

2299
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,680
First, we currently have

2300
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,680
an active director

2301
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,680
who takes care of

2302
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,680
the workstations we have.

2303
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,680
He manages the employees

2304
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,680
so they can apply

2305
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,680
and provide some policies

2306
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,680
to the systems.

2307
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,680
We're also thinking

2308
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,680
that the production workers

2309
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,680
who have access control

2310
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,680
can use the same employee

2311
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,680
with access control.

2312
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,680
We don't want to have

2313
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,680
two employees,

2314
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,680
people who are in management

2315
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,680
and people who are in production

2316
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,680
and don't have computers.

2317
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,680
That's the first use case

2318
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,680
and the second use case is

2319
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,680
something new.

2320
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The new Austrian investor is a bit worried and is interested in how much we have in production.

2321
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:24,000
We have products that are in Austria, which are of good quality.

2322
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Those that are not good, we can say that it is optically solved.

2323
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
A detector detects that the sausage is not good and turns it away.

2324
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,000
We do not trust the people in the production to be able to describe these percentages.

2325
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That is why we say that we want to have it live.

2326
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
This is an IoT problem.

2327
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
We are interested in how they would put it together.

2328
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,000
First of all, I think it is normal that we do not have a use case.

2329
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
We want to avoid the AD detector.

2330
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Secondly, it is a bit more modern.

2331
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
This is again a question.

2332
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I will answer the question so that you understand.

2333
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I will give you a context.

2334
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Cloud Adaption Framework is one of the areas that we are working on.

2335
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
If we go from the ready phase, where we know what we have and what you have changed,

2336
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
the next phase is called the landing zone.

2337
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:29,000
This is also in the ready phase, which is already in the migrate phase.

2338
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
The landing zone covers exactly what you have changed.

2339
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The landing zone works in a way that you decide what the environment in the cloud would look like.

2340
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
The first thing you do is the identity democratization.

2341
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
This means that you look at what you have.

2342
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
For example, Active Directory.

2343
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You can connect it to Azure and then you have federated access.

2344
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Multi-factor authentication is always included.

2345
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
One of the things that we call Privilege Identity Management is included.

2346
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Zero-Glass-Black-Break-Account and similar things are included.

2347
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
These are the ways in which we make sure that you know exactly when something is happening.

2348
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:19,000
What this means in practice is that you have a front worker,

2349
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
you have an IT admin and he or she signs up normally.

2350
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Now, everything goes through Azure Active Directory.

2351
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
You create a federation on AD.

2352
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
You can also move AD up in the clouds.

2353
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
You create new accounts.

2354
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
The idea of Privilege Identity Management has a lot of features in the orders.

2355
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,000
In the orders, what if a front-end worker needs access to something?

2356
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:51,000
We call it Intermediate Access.

2357
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It has a different name, but the point is that you can access it at the same time

2358
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
and then it is automatically replaced.

2359
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
We have a methodology called Zero Trust Model.

2360
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You get access, but you also lose it.

2361
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It is all automated in a way that you install it, install it,

2362
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
and it connects with each other.

2363
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It is great.

2364
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
This would solve the first problem.

2365
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You mentioned that you have two sensors,

2366
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,000
which measure all products that are and are not in order.

2367
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Because of auditing and the auditing trail,

2368
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:37,000
we do not trust newly acquired companies to send the right data.

2369
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
This is not a common example.

2370
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
For example, in the automotive industry,

2371
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
you see plastic parts for BMW.

2372
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
This is a problem.

2373
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
In some phases, you have optical detection of all parts,

2374
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
and then you lose such a manual.

2375
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
If the percentage is too high,

2376
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
it means that there is a systematic failure in the production

2377
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
and that someone has gone too far.

2378
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
This can now be used by more different operators.

2379
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
For example, we have fraud detection,

2380
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:22,000
which allows you to recognize what is happening on the basis of data.

2381
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
This is one way in which you can combine these different operators.

2382
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
You can also inform people.

2383
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
We have a very powerful alerting system

2384
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
where you can set up what is exactly happening,

2385
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
who will be notified, and where to sign up.

2386
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
This is also an option in the landing zones.

2387
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
What is the biggest problem?

2388
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I just gave a few examples of these operators.

2389
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
These operators can be easily replaced.

2390
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Someone can say, I would not have this operator.

2391
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
But this monitoring, scanning of these areas,

2392
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
you want to be able to give a note at any time.

2393
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
You are interested in what happened at the service,

2394
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
who was available, who was available,

2395
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
what were the elements,

2396
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
and you want to measure it in such a way

2397
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
that it can be easily done.

2398
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
This is where the landing zone is very important.

2399
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
If I go back to the centuries,

2400
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
we have fraud detection, IoT Hub,

2401
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
which is a very important part.

2402
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
IoT Hub is a domain.

2403
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I send some data via MQTT protocol.

2404
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
It is a different protocol.

2405
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
MQTT is one of them.

2406
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It has bidirectional communication.

2407
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
You can say, for example,

2408
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I send data via REST,

2409
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
or via RAW.

2410
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I want to do a real-time analysis

2411
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
of the data that comes in.

2412
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I want to have a specific time frame.

2413
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I want to see what is happening.

2414
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I can get, for example,

2415
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I worked with a partner,

2416
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
who sent a stream,

2417
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
a video,

2418
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
in a cloud.

2419
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
He wanted to detect,

2420
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
for example, in that video,

2421
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
a problem with a machine.

2422
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
For example, they were working

2423
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
in rural areas.

2424
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
What happened?

2425
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
They had a machine there

2426
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
that cut wood.

2427
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And now we know

2428
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
what kind of host you are.

2429
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
There is no connection there.

2430
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I mean, there is data that has to fly,

2431
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
has to be there.

2432
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
They were streaming on a device,

2433
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
via Bluetooth.

2434
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I mean, Bluetooth streaming.

2435
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
On a device that worked as a proxy.

2436
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
It took the data,

2437
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
put it in a cloud,

2438
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
and when the data

2439
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
arrived in the stream itself,

2440
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
then Azure,

2441
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
using Venhub,

2442
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
took it,

2443
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
using Cognitive Services,

2444
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
or Media Services,

2445
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
which took the frames out,

2446
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
using Fraud Detection,

2447
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
to see, for example,

2448
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
what were the changes.

2449
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Everything was recorded,

2450
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
in a database.

2451
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
He sent a notification,

2452
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
and that notification came

2453
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
to all the people who were

2454
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
relevant,

2455
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
that they did not need

2456
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
to convert the entire infrastructure.

2457
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Everything they were doing so far,

2458
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
with sensors,

2459
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
was relevant.

2460
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Bidirectional communication.

2461
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I mean, back.

2462
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I mean, who knew

2463
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
that there was a problem?

2464
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
When someone was cutting a motor,

2465
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
they didn't wait for half an hour,

2466
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
for it to cut.

2467
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
When the tractor was cut in half.

2468
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And what happened?

2469
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
He sent the information

2470
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
to the proxy,

2471
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
then via Bluetooth,

2472
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
he sent it to the machine,

2473
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and the machine shut down.

2474
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
They tested it.

2475
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Although they didn't have a motor,

2476
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
they only had a drill.

2477
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
But we saw that there was

2478
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
a new climate,

2479
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
when he started drilling.

2480
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
How long would a round trip

2481
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
take? A few seconds?

2482
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
For example,

2483
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
we send something,

2484
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
it's sent by e-mail.

2485
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It depends on the service.

2486
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
We have five services,

2487
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
and they have a certain service license agreement.

2488
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And for a specific month,

2489
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
it has to be delivered

2490
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
in 10 milliseconds.

2491
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
If you choose a service,

2492
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
a global service,

2493
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
it has to come from there.

2494
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
How does it come?

2495
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
For example, if you're going to

2496
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
make a round trip to the sea,

2497
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
you'll need a few seconds

2498
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
to get the information.

2499
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
If you take

2500
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
a solution,

2501
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
for example,

2502
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
if you're hosting something,

2503
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
it has to come.

2504
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
We have ways to connect

2505
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
the whole part,

2506
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
so that the latency

2507
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
with the network is reduced.

2508
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
For example,

2509
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
ExpressRoute is one of the solutions.

2510
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
This means that

2511
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
you have a direct connection

2512
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
with the providers,

2513
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
HANA, Telekom, etc.

2514
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
You have a direct connection

2515
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
to Azure,

2516
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
to the ad servers

2517
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
all over the world.

2518
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
The ad servers

2519
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
are the most interesting.

2520
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Cloudflare has everything.

2521
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
If you fly there

2522
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
and want to access it,

2523
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
you'll get the data

2524
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
because it's spread close to you.

2525
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
The closest ad server

2526
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
is in the South.

2527
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
When you fly to the South,

2528
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
you go directly to the Azure backbone.

2529
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
If we look at how much

2530
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
data centers are connected

2531
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
all over the world,

2532
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
data centers are

2533
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
in a lot of countries.

2534
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I don't have an exact figure,

2535
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
but data centers are a bit like the sea.

2536
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
When you decide,

2537
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
you can get to it very quickly.

2538
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I would recommend

2539
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
this part.

2540
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
The most important thing

2541
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
is that you can

2542
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
change students,

2543
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
automatically measure them,

2544
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
so you know what the problem is.

2545
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
For example, the service must be secure.

2546
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Who can access it?

2547
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
These are relevant data.

2548
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
For example, you said that Klobasa is protected.

2549
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Who can access it?

2550
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I don't know.

2551
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It must be protected,

2552
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
so that all these things

2553
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
are protected.

2554
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
A lot of services are worried about it,

2555
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
but CAF, Cloud Adoption Framework,

2556
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
is worried about all the practices

2557
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
being used in the best way.

2558
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
One more question

2559
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
about access controls.

2560
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
For example,

2561
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I decided to establish a company

2562
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
called Plosko in the EU.

2563
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We implement

2564
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
access controls,

2565
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
we have digital maps,

2566
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
people can go there,

2567
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
open the door,

2568
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
and return.

2569
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Now, we have a small

2570
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
security guard.

2571
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
We know that we have

2572
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
access controls in the cloud or locally.

2573
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
For me,

2574
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Plosko in the EU

2575
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
is easiest to integrate

2576
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
so that I can open the door.

2577
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It's an open LDAP,

2578
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
open ID connect,

2579
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
a typical integration.

2580
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
For example,

2581
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
if I want to access

2582
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
employees' names

2583
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and their

2584
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
personal information.

2585
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
We are connected via ADI.

2586
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
We have Azure Active Directory

2587
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and Federation Services

2588
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
that connect directly.

2589
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
You can use open ID or LDAP

2590
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
if you want.

2591
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
We also have other services

2592
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
that connect people

2593
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
who don't have it.

2594
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
For example,

2595
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
if someone comes

2596
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
and receives a card,

2597
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
how will you identify him

2598
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
and how will you know

2599
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
what this person can do,

2600
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
where he can access, and so on.

2601
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
We had an insight

2602
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
when we were working on a company.

2603
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
We were playing with IoT

2604
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and we were working on the lights.

2605
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
If someone comes,

2606
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
the light turns on.

2607
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
We were working with the employee

2608
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and he always had a ping.

2609
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
We have solutions

2610
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
such as

2611
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Azure B2C,

2612
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Azure B2B,

2613
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and similar services

2614
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
that can be used by Azure Active Directory.

2615
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
But it is also designed

2616
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
to be used

2617
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
by external logins.

2618
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I can make an account

2619
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
in Azure Active Directory

2620
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
and I can sign up

2621
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
for anything.

2622
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
For example,

2623
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
outlook.com, twitter.com,

2624
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
gmail.com,

2625
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
and so on.

2626
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I can sign up

2627
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
normally

2628
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and I can connect

2629
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
to the entity in the cloud.

2630
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
If you have an entity in the cloud,

2631
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
you have all the enterprise services

2632
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
that are on the cloud,

2633
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
such as monitoring,

2634
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
privilege identity,

2635
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
and similar services

2636
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
that you can perform.

2637
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Also,

2638
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
what is nice

2639
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
is that you get an option

2640
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
for those who want to sign up

2641
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
for a developer.

2642
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
You get back

2643
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
a way

2644
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
to connect

2645
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
to your code

2646
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
that you have

2647
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
in the application.

2648
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Now,

2649
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
we talked about motorcycles.

2650
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
We also talked about helmets.

2651
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
We also talked about Zaire.

2652
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Two

2653
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
questions

2654
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I still have.

2655
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
One is about the community.

2656
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I will give you the last example.

2657
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I see that we are

2658
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
close to the end.

2659
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
The third example

2660
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
that we wanted to give you

2661
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
is a little more edgy,

2662
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
a little closer to Kubernetes.

2663
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I assume that

2664
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
you are more interested in it.

2665
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I will describe it to you.

2666
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
The example is

2667
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Rocke,

2668
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
a player who travels to Slovenia.

2669
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Do you know him?

2670
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
No.

2671
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I mean, I know him.

2672
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I didn't play with him.

2673
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
He ruled it.

2674
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
A lot of girls

2675
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
didn't go there.

2676
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
When our podcast

2677
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
will be listened by a lot of people,

2678
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Rocke will become even more popular.

2679
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
We will now

2680
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
do a startup.

2681
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Nothing has been done yet.

2682
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
We can easily do anything.

2683
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
There is a desire

2684
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
for a multiplayer Rocke game

2685
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
with an AI player,

2686
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
player-to-player,

2687
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
and also

2688
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
with a player.

2689
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
We have some AI models

2690
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
that need to be trained

2691
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
on a large amount of data,

2692
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
make some

2693
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
GPU-intensive computations.

2694
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Then we want

2695
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
to have a mobile and web app.

2696
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
We want to have

2697
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
notifications.

2698
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
That's nothing special.

2699
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Now we want to have

2700
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
bi-directional communications,

2701
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
WebSockets and HTTP2.

2702
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
We expect a lot of users,

2703
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
as we said.

2704
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
What else?

2705
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
We have a cousin who is a VC investor.

2706
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
He will be our capital today.

2707
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
No problem.

2708
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
What is more important

2709
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
is this

2710
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
market.

2711
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
We have to do it quickly.

2712
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
How would you do it?

2713
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
The question is

2714
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
if we take all

2715
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
the things

2716
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
that we have already changed.

2717
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
You have changed Kubernetes.

2718
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Kubernetes is a stupid thing

2719
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
that everyone takes and says

2720
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
that it is the solution for the whole problem.

2721
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
But for this thing

2722
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
it is not necessary

2723
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
because it is the best solution.

2724
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
It is nice, you can use it,

2725
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
but it would require

2726
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
different services.

2727
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Before you chose Kubernetes,

2728
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
you should have believed in something else.

2729
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Of course.

2730
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I gave you a good example.

2731
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Kubernetes is a law.

2732
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You can do miracles,

2733
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
you can destroy a lot of things.

2734
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I liked this.

2735
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I have a Raspberry Pi cluster

2736
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
that is now black

2737
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
because you can burn a Raspberry Pi

2738
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
if you play too much.

2739
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And similar things.

2740
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
What I want to say is that

2741
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Kubernetes is really great,

2742
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
but sometimes you have to look

2743
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
at what you need.

2744
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Kubernetes solves the problem

2745
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
that you have a lot of servers

2746
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
that you want to self-manage,

2747
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
that you can communicate with each other,

2748
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
that you can quickly scale,

2749
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
that you can add servers.

2750
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Let me give you an example.

2751
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
We used Service Fabric.

2752
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
The learning curve of Service Fabric

2753
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
is a bit more complex.

2754
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But let me give you

2755
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
an example of a game

2756
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
where planes were shooting each other.

2757
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
What we use from behind

2758
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
is an actor model

2759
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
where

2760
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
it shows

2761
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
in detail

2762
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
the framework that is used

2763
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
by Orleans.

2764
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It is a Microsoft framework

2765
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
that is open source,

2766
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
but has been used since then.

2767
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Based on this,

2768
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
they made tests

2769
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
and used Service Fabric.

2770
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
There is also a great video

2771
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
on YouTube

2772
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
where they demonstrate

2773
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
how all these actors work.

2774
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It's phenomenal how quickly they do it.

2775
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Wait,

2776
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
in the Orleans framework

2777
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
there are names

2778
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
such as

2779
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Silos,

2780
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
etc.

2781
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
From behind,

2782
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
the whole story is

2783
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
that you have a framework

2784
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
that solves the problem

2785
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
of how you store data,

2786
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
how you work

2787
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
with objects,

2788
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
where you store them,

2789
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
where they live.

2790
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Silos can be imagined

2791
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
as one of the

2792
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
very fast serializers

2793
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
that store the state

2794
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
of an object.

2795
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
For example, a player

2796
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
on a disc

2797
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
through memory

2798
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
is equal to

2799
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Orleans.

2800
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
It is also open source.

2801
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Orleans is not just about

2802
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
taking everything.

2803
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You can say,

2804
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I would like just one part.

2805
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
You have a reference.

2806
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Ok, let's go.

2807
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
You need to know what you are doing.

2808
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But if you want a fast serializer,

2809
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
you take it down,

2810
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
save it and move on.

2811
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
My point is that

2812
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
it depends on whether you have

2813
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
already done the programming.

2814
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Sorry, additional question.

2815
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I have already developed

2816
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
in Gojo.

2817
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Yes, in Gojo.

2818
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
We already have a prototype.

2819
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That's not a problem.

2820
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
What are you going to talk about?

2821
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
In Gojo,

2822
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
there is a different story.

2823
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Service Fabric

2824
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
works on .NET.

2825
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It is a .NET framework.

2826
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
.NET Core,

2827
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
which runs on other platforms,

2828
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Orleans works on it.

2829
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And most of the work.

2830
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
In Gojo,

2831
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
for example,

2832
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
if you want to use

2833
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
front-end storage,

2834
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
we have libraries

2835
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
that you can use.

2836
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
You also have

2837
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Go SDK

2838
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
for managed libraries

2839
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
with Azure.

2840
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
For example,

2841
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
you need to create a new service.

2842
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
You can do it through Go.

2843
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
You can easily

2844
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
add things from scratch.

2845
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
You also have web apps

2846
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
that run on Go.

2847
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
You also have background services,

2848
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
where you can use scripts

2849
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
from within Go.

2850
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
The only thing you need is .exe.

2851
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
You can't even hear it for women.

2852
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
We have a way to use Go.

2853
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It is a game

2854
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
where you have real-time communication.

2855
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
You can use Go

2856
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
in

2857
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
a network,

2858
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
and you can use it

2859
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
for all communication.

2860
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
You also have a learning machine.

2861
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Communication between them is PubSub,

2862
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
which we have as a server.

2863
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
We also have SignalR as a server.

2864
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
SignalR is a Microsoft real-time framework.

2865
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
PubSub is a web PubSub.

2866
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It is also

2867
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
one of the solutions

2868
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
that we have in this area.

2869
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It allows real communication

2870
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
through websockets.

2871
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It also automatically knows

2872
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
if a websocket is available.

2873
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
You can optimize

2874
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
everything in one place.

2875
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
For example,

2876
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
if I want to do machine learning

2877
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
in one place,

2878
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
if I want to do applications in one place,

2879
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
if I want to do logging in one place,

2880
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
in short, everything.

2881
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
You can do it in one place,

2882
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
scale it,

2883
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and you can put a task here.

2884
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
The next question is

2885
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
that we are very popular in Asia.

2886
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Multi-regional is on the table.

2887
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
The second task

2888
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
that I would like to do

2889
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
depends on

2890
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
whether you have a relationship or not.

2891
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
NoSQL.

2892
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I can't go there,

2893
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
but I can go there.

2894
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
It doesn't matter.

2895
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
If you are young,

2896
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
you can change everything.

2897
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Is PubSub a global service?

2898
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Yes.

2899
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
PubSub is easy.

2900
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Global services mean

2901
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
that you can use it in more regions.

2902
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
We have a global service

2903
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
that we have in the world.

2904
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
For example,

2905
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Traffic Manager,

2906
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
which is a DNS-based

2907
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
load balancer.

2908
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
It is a global service.

2909
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
You create it in a specific resource,

2910
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
but it is global.

2911
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You create PubSub in a specific region,

2912
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
but you have more options

2913
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
to choose more regions.

2914
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
You have a load balancer.

2915
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
You have more ways

2916
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
to use them.

2917
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I would like to add one more thing.

2918
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
You can ask me later.

2919
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
If I were to choose

2920
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
something like this,

2921
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I would probably choose mix and match.

2922
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I would choose services

2923
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
because I don't like machine learning.

2924
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Also, if you want to run

2925
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
a machine learning that will work well,

2926
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
you need a GPU.

2927
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
That means you need

2928
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
different virtual machines.

2929
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Kubernetes supports this.

2930
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Kubernetes chooses

2931
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
this.

2932
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Again, this is expensive.

2933
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I would rather choose a pet service

2934
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
in cooperation with machine learning

2935
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
or in cooperation with

2936
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Cognitive Services,

2937
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
which would combine PubSub

2938
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
for communication between them.

2939
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I wouldn't choose PubSub

2940
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
as a single service.

2941
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I would choose Event Grid.

2942
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Event Grid is

2943
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
a global PubSub.

2944
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Event Grid?

2945
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Event Grid, yes.

2946
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Event Grid.

2947
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
In Azure,

2948
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
you have three main

2949
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
messaging services.

2950
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
One is Event Grid, which is a global

2951
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
PubSub.

2952
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Then you have Enterprise

2953
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Service Bus.

2954
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Then you have

2955
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
PubSub.

2956
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Event Grid

2957
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
means you can

2958
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
get inside...

2959
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
You have Event Hub and similar

2960
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
services for real-time streaming

2961
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
and IoT, which we talked about.

2962
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Event Grid allows you to

2963
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
collect a huge amount of information

2964
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
and then decide how

2965
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
this information will go forward.

2966
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You can filter on-wire.

2967
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You can filter

2968
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and decide.

2969
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
You have

2970
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
different formats

2971
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
for the service.

2972
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
The good thing is that you have

2973
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
a standardized format

2974
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
which is called Cloud Events.

2975
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
It is also supported by Google and AWS.

2976
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
You can cross-code.

2977
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
That's right.

2978
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
If you look at my GitHub,

2979
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
on my github.com,

2980
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
don't cry yet.

2981
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It's huge.

2982
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:15,000
We did a webinar and we did a simulation in real-time for the use of serverless.

2983
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
It looked like this. We had a hardware that was running and we simulated it.

2984
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:29,000
This hardware was a Lambda function on AWS. It sent information to Event Grid.

2985
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Event Grid then produced all this information and sent it to the website.

2986
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,000
On the website, the person then got the information and did a real-time data transfer.

2987
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Then we simulated it in such a way that this hardware, Lambda, sent data to the key.

2988
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Then we sent 100,000 data forward and Event Grid took it.

2989
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
They did a real-time simulation when the whole thing moved up.

2990
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Then we showed how it was processed and worked on it.

2991
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Then we also had a Power BI as a reporting tool where you could pass this information to the person.

2992
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
We also do some scoring.

2993
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Probably through Event Hub and Service Bus, you can easily pump it into a warehouse.

2994
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Yes, you can.

2995
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Event Grid is a PubSub.

2996
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
You have a publisher and a subscriber.

2997
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
We have a task called Stream Analytics, which collects data.

2998
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Then you write a query like language, what the data did, and you have an output.

2999
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
The output is easy.

3000
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
SQL is easy. Cosmos DB, for example.

3001
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I would recommend Cosmos DB because it has a task that has…

3002
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Can you tell us a bit more about Cosmos DB?

3003
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Cosmos DB is our solution for SQL.

3004
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:05,000
It uses Sharding and similar tools.

3005
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
The idea is that it uses NoSQL-like languages.

3006
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
You can use it as a click API.

3007
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
You can use SQLite syntax.

3008
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
You can use MongoDB.

3009
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
You can use MongoDB Connection.

3010
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
It transforms when it's MongoDB.

3011
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Yes.

3012
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
In the end, it writes performantly to more locations.

3013
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
The advantage is that you have very low latency.

3014
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Plus, Geo Replication.

3015
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
You can easily replicate it in Asia.

3016
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Everyone is good at it.

3017
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Everyone who uses TikTok.

3018
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And similar people who use it.

3019
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:53,000
If this company, Torok.AI, started with budgets are tight,

3020
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:59,000
and I tell you that mind developers, devops, cloud engineers,

3021
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
mind developers don't like it,

3022
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I would be surprised if there is also this Azure for Gaming.

3023
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
You have some products in this space that are specifically made for the gaming industry.

3024
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yes, that's true, but it's a field that is really unknown.

3025
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Unfortunately, this field is really unknown.

3026
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
This technology that we have now changed,

3027
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I think our audience will get to know it and use it.

3028
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
You probably have it for some verticals.

3029
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
We have clouds for very different variants.

3030
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
You have a cloud for health.

3031
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
You have a cloud for non-profit.

3032
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
A cloud for the automotive industry and similar things.

3033
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
So people are afraid to look at it from the inside,

3034
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
their verticals that they are trying to develop.

3035
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
That's right.

3036
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
When someone decides to develop a game.

3037
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I told you about a game from my table,

3038
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
because I cover Kubernetes, Dotnet, PowerShell and PAS.

3039
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
So from my table, if I were to fly,

3040
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
people who play games would probably remember

3041
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
how the developers specialized for this field.

3042
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Then they could go into this story in more detail.

3043
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
What is true is that...

3044
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I lost the thread.

3045
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
PlayFab is much better.

3046
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:36,000
No, no, I just want to say that if people go to our documentation,

3047
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
in Azure we have one section called Azure Architecture Center.

3048
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Azure Architecture Center is not only about having a huge architecture,

3049
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
but it also has one of the options for design patterns,

3050
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:57,000
architecture styles, so that people understand what it is all about.

3051
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Then there is the next section that we call Technology Selection.

3052
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And then there is another section that we call Different Clouds.

3053
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
In Different Clouds are all the information that people see

3054
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
and can choose exactly which devices are connected,

3055
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
what they can use, and so on.

3056
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It's like when you open a book, you help yourself.

3057
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Either your hand hurts or the cover.

3058
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Then there is a selection that brings you to the technologies that...

3059
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
You help yourself.

3060
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
It brings you to the technologies that you put some inputs into,

3061
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
so that you can say, these are the three options out of the 300.

3062
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Yes, and here we go back to the story we mentioned at the beginning.

3063
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And then you have the helpers, as I mentioned at the beginning,

3064
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
when we have internal bots that help you choose.

3065
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
And one of them is the roadmaps that we have.

3066
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:04,000
If you want to cut something, you can go to learn.microsoft.com

3067
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
and you get a guide that takes you through the whole process.

3068
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,000
And there you also have the option to choose and it includes

3069
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:21,000
this part with connections, with interactive devices,

3070
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
and also to us, contact to us.

3071
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
So you have these options.

3072
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
If, for example, you want to do a little more,

3073
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
and you want specialized help, what happens?

3074
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
You learn, you work, and then you say,

3075
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
hey, there are five of us, we are self-developers,

3076
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
what's the problem?

3077
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
We need to set up a database.

3078
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Or I don't know, that it will really be set up correctly.

3079
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
How can we do that?

3080
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And then you go to the marketplace,

3081
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
and it gives you all the partners that are specialized for this area.

3082
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And then you say, okay, you are the closest,

3083
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
let's take a look and make a story.

3084
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
We solved the problem.

3085
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
That's it.

3086
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Now I would really like to,

3087
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
we have something in common,

3088
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
so I would like to try to connect.

3089
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
We are fully open-sourced.

3090
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
We have a lot of partners.

3091
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
We have a lot of partners.

3092
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
We have a lot of partners.

3093
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
We have a lot of partners.

3094
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
We have a lot of partners.

3095
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
We are fully open-sourced.

3096
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
This is very familiar to us.

3097
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And we've already talked a little bit about the community.

3098
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And maybe open-source is also successful because of the community.

3099
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
So I wrote a couple of open-source projects

3100
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
that I somehow discovered under Microsoft.

3101
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I wrote VS Code, TypeScript, .NET.

3102
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
A few years ago, I chose Microsoft Searching Linux

3103
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:57,000
and the whole story of how Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation,

3104
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
that it is in the Linux kernel security list,

3105
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
that kernel patches contribute.

3106
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
And because of that, we also see

3107
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
that you have Windows Services for Linux,

3108
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
and you can use it on Windows.

3109
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
There is some kind of collaboration,

3110
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
and I went to look at other projects,

3111
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,000
and I found that Windows calculator, for example,

3112
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
is now open-sourced, released, written in C++ and C Sharp,

3113
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
and is pre-installed on Windows.

3114
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I see that there is some kind of full transformation

3115
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
happening in this area with Microsoft.

3116
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And now I'm trying to find a space

3117
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
to ask Andras about PowerShell,

3118
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
because you're also a full-time user,

3119
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
and you know a lot about it.

3120
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
This is your segue.

3121
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
This is a bit of a joke, but it's not.

3122
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:04,000
We are used to, if you go more from the Unix ecosystem,

3123
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
and for us, I usually look at the black terminal,

3124
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
because we need to use browsers,

3125
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
but it's very close to us.

3126
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
And then we had an environment,

3127
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
and we were like, okay, this is our circle.

3128
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
What kind of question would be the best?

3129
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
And it was kind of an interesting pattern.

3130
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I think that my peers have a big problem

3131
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
with learning PowerShell,

3132
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
because it's hard to hear it.

3133
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
For example, a few years ago,

3134
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
we had some data flow, some files,

3135
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
and now I know that if I right-click,

3136
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I can compress this file into a zip file,

3137
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
and then I was like, okay,

3138
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I'm going to do this with PowerShell.

3139
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
In Unix systems, I don't need to look at the documentation,

3140
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,000
of course, I'm very experienced.

3141
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
When you come to Microsoft as an employee,

3142
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
or as a partner,

3143
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
what is the way to learn PowerShell?

3144
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Because I think that the interface changes a lot.

3145
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
What's the menu? What's the menu?

3146
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Because I really don't know how to click.

3147
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Okay, maybe...

3148
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Automation.

3149
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
When we look at the open source,

3150
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
we have a split page

3151
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:39,000
with all the projects that Microsoft is working on.

3152
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
If you look at the number of commits

3153
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
that we've made in open source in the last few years,

3154
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
it has increased a lot.

3155
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
You just mentioned a few of them.

3156
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
TypeScript, for example.

3157
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
If you look at what's in common in all of this,

3158
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
if you look at what TypeScript is based on,

3159
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
you still have JavaScript, but you have these objects,

3160
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
you have these languages.

3161
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Who is it based on?

3162
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
If you look at it again,

3163
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Helzberg is based on C Sharp,

3164
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
which is again an object language.

3165
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
PowerShell, again, is an object language.

3166
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Everything works in such a way

3167
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
that it becomes more and more productive.

3168
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
We also have our own Linux, for example,

3169
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
and similar tasks.

3170
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
We're not just bosses.

3171
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
AKS, for example,

3172
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Kubernetes Service,

3173
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
has also invested a lot in the fact

3174
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
that we've open sourced a virtual kubelet.

3175
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
It's a small task that allows you...

3176
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
It's an interface that you can use

3177
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
to write your own kubelet,

3178
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
which Kubernetes understands as its own.

3179
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
It's an agent that lives on the machine

3180
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
that makes sure that the information stays

3181
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
and so on.

3182
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
And what's great about it is that

3183
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
because you have a virtual kubelet,

3184
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
you can access the current services.

3185
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
What's the problem?

3186
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I know I went a bit too far,

3187
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
but that's how I get back.

3188
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
That's how I get back.

3189
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
But just as an illustration,

3190
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
what's the problem?

3191
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Kubernetes still has so much behind it,

3192
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
and what's the problem

3193
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
if a virtual kubelet is missing?

3194
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
You can make a new one,

3195
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
but the new system will do it automatically.

3196
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
But what's the problem?

3197
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
You'll lose half a minute,

3198
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
or 20 seconds, or more.

3199
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
You need the task now.

3200
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
If you sell some factories,

3201
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
that's a lot of money flying around.

3202
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
For example, in the future,

3203
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
you can buy a kubelet with computers

3204
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
that are already in the back,

3205
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
and then the task is done.

3206
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Let's go back to PowerShell.

3207
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I jumped out of open source.

3208
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
But it's open source, isn't it?

3209
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Yes, it is.

3210
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
You have PowerShell on github.com,

3211
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
forward slash Microsoft,

3212
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
forward slash PowerShell,

3213
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
and you get everything back.

3214
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
The whole source code,

3215
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
and you can see how things work.

3216
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
And,

3217
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I think,

3218
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
and,

3219
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
and what's nice,

3220
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
is that,

3221
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Microsoft doesn't always tell you

3222
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
that you have to use PowerShell.

3223
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
That's your own choice.

3224
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
It doesn't always tell you

3225
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
that you have to use Windows.

3226
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
You can use Linux.

3227
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Although, you'll probably be a little limited,

3228
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
because certain services on Linux

3229
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
are definitely not.

3230
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
For example, in Teams,

3231
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
you can only use Skype.

3232
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
You can't use Outlook,

3233
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
and similar things.

3234
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
And they didn't always tell you

3235
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
that you can't use other services.

3236
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
But,

3237
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
you can also use Bash.

3238
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
For PowerShell,

3239
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I started to learn it

3240
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
at the beginning,

3241
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
especially because

3242
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
I saw a demo

3243
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
where a person did

3244
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
a search on the registry

3245
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
to use

3246
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
basic instructions

3247
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
through PowerShell.

3248
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
What did it look like?

3249
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
For example, if it was in Bash,

3250
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
you go to the terminal,

3251
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
you type in cd Downloads,

3252
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
and you type in ls,

3253
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
and it takes you back.

3254
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
In PowerShell,

3255
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
because it's a dotnet,

3256
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
you can use it

3257
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
as a provider.

3258
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
And it's the same.

3259
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
You type in cd,

3260
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
and in the registry,

3261
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
you type in ls,

3262
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
and you get the registry back.

3263
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You type in ls, star,

3264
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
and so on.

3265
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
In short, it gives you

3266
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
a lot of power.

3267
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You don't need to type 30 times

3268
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
to get the information back,

3269
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
but you really get the power.

3270
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
What's the biggest power?

3271
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I wrote it down,

3272
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
and it's on my github,

3273
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
for Kubernetes.

3274
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It's an engine,

3275
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
where you type in kubectl,

3276
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
which is a client tool

3277
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
from Google.

3278
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
You type in kubectl,

3279
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
get pods.

3280
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I wrote an example of PowerShell,

3281
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
where you type in cd,

3282
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
pods.

3283
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
You type in ls,

3284
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
and it takes you back to pods.

3285
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
The interaction

3286
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
you want to have

3287
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
with the system is completely different.

3288
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
You don't work

3289
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
only with text objects,

3290
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
but you work with objects.

3291
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
You use objects,

3292
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
and you control them.

3293
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
That's why I chose

3294
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
the code.

3295
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
If you look at the documentation,

3296
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
all the examples are made

3297
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
with Bash, with PowerShell,

3298
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
and so on.

3299
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
The easiest way, of course,

3300
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
is to use

3301
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Microsoft Shop,

3302
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
because on all servers

3303
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
PowerShell is already

3304
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
on top by default.

3305
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
You don't need to install anything.

3306
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
We have Windows subsystem for Linux,

3307
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
but what's the problem?

3308
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
On servers,

3309
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Windows 2022

3310
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
is already an option to add it,

3311
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
but you can install it as a package.

3312
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Then you have to use Bash,

3313
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
and you can learn it.

3314
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
We also have a tutorial on that.

3315
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Microsoft has an official tutorial

3316
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
on www.microsoft.com,

3317
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
where you can learn

3318
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
how to use Bash,

3319
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
and so on.

3320
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
With PowerShell,

3321
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
it's already built-in,

3322
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
and you can use it normally.

3323
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Microsoft has also

3324
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
introduced Open Source,

3325
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
by the way,

3326
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Windows Terminal,

3327
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
which is a tool on Windows

3328
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
that can be used

3329
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
not only for Linux,

3330
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
but also for other ideas

3331
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
that the community has,

3332
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
regarding the use of Terminal,

3333
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
and how it looks like for an application,

3334
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
as it should look like,

3335
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
in terms of usability,

3336
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
design, usability,

3337
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
portability, and so on.

3338
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
It's the same as if,

3339
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
for example,

3340
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
on Linux,

3341
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I would take and use

3342
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Electricity,

3343
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
or I would use Fish,

3344
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I would use it for those

3345
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
who don't have it.

3346
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
It's not a plus,

3347
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
it's easier,

3348
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
because we are Microsoft,

3349
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
in the sense that all the documentation

3350
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
is connected.

3351
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
And you have your own security,

3352
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
as we said.

3353
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
It's nice to know

3354
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
those things,

3355
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
because when you come to a company

3356
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
that does migration,

3357
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
there is automation,

3358
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
and you have to give something to them,

3359
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
and everyone understands that,

3360
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
even those who work

3361
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
for Windows servers,

3362
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
they understand PowerShell,

3363
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
because it's integrated into the system.

3364
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I hope I answered your question.

3365
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I think you did.

3366
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Andraž, any last thoughts?

3367
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
No,

3368
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I think it was great.

3369
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I think we didn't say

3370
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
a lot of things,

3371
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
so if someone listens to this,

3372
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
we will put the links in the description.

3373
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Yes, yes.

3374
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I learned a lot of things.

3375
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Some things are just

3376
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
symmetrical,

3377
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
and others are new to me.

3378
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
So it was great for me.

3379
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Bojan, any last thoughts?

3380
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
My last thought

3381
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
is that

3382
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
you can see

3383
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
that

3384
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
the mission statement

3385
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
that we have,

3386
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Empower Evernalization

3387
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
on the planet,

3388
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I can see it in practice,

3389
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
and I can say that

3390
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I am proud to be a part of it,

3391
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and to be a part of

3392
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Microsoft for the last time.

3393
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Very interesting things are happening,

3394
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
it's fun to learn something new

3395
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
every day.

3396
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
That's one of the things

3397
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
you have to do as a cloud solution architect,

3398
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
you have to learn a lot.

3399
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
That's a key thought.

3400
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Bojan,

3401
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Andraž, thank you for your time.

3402
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Thank you for listening,

3403
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
thank you for your attention,

3404
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
give us some feedback,

3405
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
share with your friends, colleagues

3406
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
and experts,

3407
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
and see you next week.

3408
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Good luck, goodbye.

3409
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Thank you for having me, good luck.
