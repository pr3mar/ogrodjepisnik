1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And that's how our jingle came to be.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we are here in Porto Rojo,

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in the conference room of Make It,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Jcon, Sjoug...

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Wait, what else?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, Slovenia, cheers!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's what's written there.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And that's where we're going to film

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a new episode of Grodje.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
An episode that we didn't really plan,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but because we met a great guest at the conference,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we decided to do it very spontaneously and quickly.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Especially because it was a great day at the conference

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and I think we could hear more of what we heard today

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and our guests as well.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The episodes may be a bit shorter than the others,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but everything will be very interesting.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, that's a soft intro.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And I'd like to introduce the guest first.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Today with me is Amadea Derenda Mujezinovic.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hello.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Amadea... Amadea...

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll try to pronounce it correctly,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so you can correct me.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She's a senior UI, UX researcher.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't know if you're a consultant or contractor as well,

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but you're currently working for Caldi.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Before that, I think you worked for Messi for 7 or 8 years.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A company that makes medical devices, if I'm not mistaken.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're also a very visible and very active member

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
of the UX community in Slovenia.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And... What else do I have to say?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're also a co-founder of the Screen Savers project,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
which is, if I understood correctly,

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and you can correct me,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is an academy for UI, UX

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and you teach courses for people

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
in service design, UX...

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What else?

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Actually, how to come...

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How to prepare what to build,

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and then somehow move it to development.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So we're actually going...

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now we're preparing to go into product management,

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
or this part, how to talk to stakeholders and so on.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But basically, we started from the fact

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that this is a specific knowledge,

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that we have visual designers,

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and then when they come into tech,

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it's a whole different world.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And there are other competencies that are also important.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And a few years ago we realized

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that it's very difficult to do

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and learn when you come from a company.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And also companies really don't know

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
how this role can help in reality.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We said, okay, let's do a few courses.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We did a few courses, now we have some mentors,

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
who cover various aspects from research

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to product management, to UI.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We would also go more into leadership topics,

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because we see that there is still a lot of space here.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And then there are things that we do on the side,

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
like consulting in companies, coaching,

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
also how to work with designers,

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
how to transform design as a role in the company.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So there are a lot of things.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you a corporation?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you a company?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A company.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A company, okay.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And otherwise you work in various fields.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's right.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In this role.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Both are co-founders, and I'm still working.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So both take on the role of some people,

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and I'm still working in Hlavijar,

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and I'm still in Kaldi, because I've already changed.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So on the one hand, I set up these systems,

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and then I'm trying to move more of this to Slovenia.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now, here I wrote down,

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know if you're still starting,

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but for a while there was this GoJam,

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
where you actually helped to promote public administration,

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
or how to improve public services,

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
or can you tell me more about that?

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, actually, GoJams were part of an initiative called Service Jams,

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and it's a global initiative,

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
where on a weekend,

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the process that Service Designers and UXers use,

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you do that on a weekend,

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
in 48 hours, you come up with an idea,

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and then to a tested prototype.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
These are hackathons.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's not really a hackathon,

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
it's more about what to build,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
than what to actually build.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because there's a lot of code in hackathons,

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and a lot is expected on the delivery,

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but for us, it was always more,

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
when you go out to talk to people,

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
they have this problem,

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
to make the first prototype,

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
because this is a prototype.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But it's always around government services, right?

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No, there were three.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We did three in a row.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There was the Service Jam,

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
which was very general,

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
about designing machines,

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
then there was the GoJam,

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
which was aimed at public administration,

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and then there was the Sustainability Jam.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was led by a team from Germany,

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
so we were very connected with them,

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and we were very close to the community,

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
it was very fine, very powerful.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Also, how I got into UX,

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
my background is in graphic design,

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
because I've never really felt at home.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then there was this jam,

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I was a student, I needed a job,

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've been a cook for seven years,

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I had no real experience,

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and then there was this workshop,

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't even know what a workshop was.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And then there were a lot of people from D-Lab,

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
from the design studio,

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and then I was like,

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
maybe I should go,

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
maybe I'll get a job out of it.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And then I came to Cain,

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and they told me about this process,

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and I was like, oh my God,

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
this is how it should be done,

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
this is how we have to do it.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you say graphic design,

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
we're talking about...

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What does graphic design mean today?

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Did they teach you to draw, I don't know,

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
binoculars?

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Did they teach you to make apps?

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I mean, give us an explanation.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What did they teach you today?

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's actually a very good question.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Since I've been at FACS for a long time,

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
we'll never know.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
For example, I worked at NTF,

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Graphic Interactive Communication,

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and the cool thing about NTF was

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
that we learned a little bit of everything.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
From making some videos,

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to creating some websites in Joomla,

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
to, I don't know,

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
having math and everything,

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and we also had a little bit of graphic design.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What did we have back then?

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There was graphic design for posters,

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
packaging, typography, and so on.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I think that most of all NTFs

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
still focus on graphic design,

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
around typography, around printing.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Everything goes in digital,

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
digital as a static, unnecessary thing in the media.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
While when you work in TEC,

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the apps are really alive.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And here, of course,

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
FACSs don't change very quickly,

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
they change the curriculum a lot,

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but TEC develops very quickly.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In those computer schools,

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
they tell you that in the beginning

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the colors will remain the same,

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
then you change the programming language,

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and some concepts remain the same.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
With graphic design,

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can ask you this question,

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that the colors will still be the same.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The basic skill set will probably still be the same,

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
but the technology changes everything.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think that the colors will remain the same,

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the type will remain the same,

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the look and feel, the brand, everything will remain the same.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But there is a big difference

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
in how these things are built.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
In graphic design,

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
one of the things that I think

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I suffered a bit with,

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is that everyone has their own eyes.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And if you're not really that good,

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
it's hard to have a presence,

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
it's hard to have a status,

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
in the sense that you can say to a teacher,

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
this makes sense,

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
we won't give you any more.

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But with UX and service design,

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you go to research,

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and someone else tells you these things,

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and you bring back the proof,

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and you're like, if so many people said that,

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
is it possible?

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sometimes it's not true, but...

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Can I say something else?

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I wrote down that you also have some drinks.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll say it like this,

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
if you're interested in UX, service design, UI design,

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
go to screensavers,

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and go to GoJams,

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
but you also have some meetups,

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
or drinks,

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
we can invite people to that,

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
if you're interested.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Go ahead.

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Service design,

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
times UX drinks,

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
so,

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
sometimes we do service design drinks,

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
one team,

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Evo Iršinjaklević did a UX meetup,

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and then we said,

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
this is a similar audience,

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
where we do similar things,

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
what if we combined it?

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So, service design times UX drinks Ljubljana,

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
we do them monthly,

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
between October and May,

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
so we're online, we're live,

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
we have our guests,

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
we have our guests.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you have a presentation?

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Usually,

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
we have some guests,

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and then there are different formats,

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
from round tables,

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to presentations,

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
some classic ones,

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
again, we have a lot of guests,

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and we collaborate on the format.

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We also work in an interactive way,

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we include people,

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
it's very important for us

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to include people during the event,

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and to do it in some way.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
To try to make it very interactive.

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Great.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll put the link below,

250
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
so if you're interested,

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
go check it out.

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Join us.

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now we're going to talk about

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
your talk at the conference.

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
As I said,

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
there were four tracks,

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
we heard from Kubernetes,

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to Java,

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and other technologies,

260
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
bass, etc.

261
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But your talk stood out,

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
because it didn't fit

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
into just Java.

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But when I listened to the talk,

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in the end,

266
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
it was the biggest question.

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I think there were ten questions,

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
people felt that what you said

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
is very important,

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and that they have a lot more questions.

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's why I wanted you to say it again,

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
so that people can relate.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I would just like you to say

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
what the title was.

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Or should I say it?

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I already have the title.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The title was

278
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Coexistence between Product Designers

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and Developers.

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The summary was

281
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that developers,

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
product designers,

283
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and product people

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
have to cooperate.

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why, how...

286
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That was the talk.

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And...

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The starting point.

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then what?

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
First of all, thank you.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I have to say that

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was really...

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I spent two weeks

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
asking myself

296
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
what I will do

297
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and what I will need.

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What will I have

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to sell

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
to the European community.

301
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I am very happy

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
that it was such a call.

303
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And...

304
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I talk a lot

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
about cooperation,

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
how we have to cooperate

307
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and communicate

308
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
so that good products

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and good apps

310
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
can only be created

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
if we work well together.

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This is always reflected

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
in all the friction

314
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
that happens in teams.

315
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But mostly because

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
we don't speak the same language.

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And...

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know.

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I often hear

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
how designers

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
don't know how to talk to developers

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and we don't understand them.

323
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
On the other hand,

324
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
they don't understand us.

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And nobody from us

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
speaks business.

327
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And...

328
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
To be honest,

329
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
this cycle is a bit

330
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
strange.

331
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It can already explode.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And...

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There you gave

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
a good pitch

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
at the beginning

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
in the kitchen.

337
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And you used

338
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
a very good analogy.

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Say it again, please.

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

341
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We talked about

342
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
all the possible frameworks

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that we often

344
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
take very seriously.

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If they work on Spotify

346
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
they will also work for us.

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And they are often taken as recipes.

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We have some business

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
insights

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
for the beginning.

351
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then we add two back-end developers

352
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
to build

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a strong base

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
for the team.

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then we add a front-end developer

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and a designer

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
to make it better

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and to improve it.

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And a product manager

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
to mix it all together.

361
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We put everything together.

362
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We cook 6-8 sprints.

363
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We mix all the other products.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that's it.

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Then we have an MVP.

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's strange why...

367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's true.

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The problem is

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
that the MVP

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
is not really an MVP.

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know if we should say

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
MVP 1.0.

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Those things that we put out

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
are 0.5, 0.6.

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because in the end

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
to do something

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
in 0

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
it's really 0.

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You do it well

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
when you put it out

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but it's so stripped down.

382
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This kitchen has a bombastic

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
logic.

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Did it connect you

385
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
when you came to

386
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the triangle

387
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
where you connected

388
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the product manager,

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
designer

390
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and developer?

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why does this triangle

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
have to work?

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
First we had to decide

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
what we're going to cook.

395
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What's the MVP

396
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that we're going to follow.

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And now, as I said

398
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
in Real Life is Easy

399
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you look at the time,

400
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
how many people are in the fridge.

401
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
In a digital product

402
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it's not that simple.

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Nothing is really simple

404
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
in a digital product.

405
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When you have

406
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
some stakeholders,

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
more people influence

408
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the menu.

409
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Here we work

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
more with the main

411
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
cooks.

412
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I think we often

413
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
forget that

414
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
in design, in development

415
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
you have a very, very

416
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
important role.

417
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
As I said,

418
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
we're not just cutting

419
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
vegetables.

420
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But we have to cooperate

421
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
in this process

422
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
even before it starts cooking.

423
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
To define

424
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the product well,

425
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
to define what we're doing,

426
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
why we're doing it,

427
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
for whom we're doing it.

428
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The management brings

429
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
the business side here.

430
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
They make sure that things are

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
viable.

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Development makes sure

433
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that we can build things.

434
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Design makes sure

435
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that there's

436
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
always a user

437
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
for whom we're working.

438
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It makes sure that

439
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
users are found

440
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and that you want to use it.

441
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Not that it's just

442
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
one person.

443
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The role

444
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
of the developer

445
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and designer

446
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
in functional teams

447
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
changes.

448
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You can't

449
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
wait

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
for someone to magically

451
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
solve everything

452
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and then you'll

453
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
be like,

454
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
let's build it.

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You have to be very proactive

456
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
to get stakeholders

457
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
involved in the process.

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They have to be

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
very early.

460
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
People are aware of that.

461
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Of course.

462
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let me ask you

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
how do you

464
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
get developers involved

465
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
in the process?

466
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What do you expect

467
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
from developers

468
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
in this way of cooking?

469
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's great

470
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
when developers start

471
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
from scratch.

472
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
When they come to research

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
or listen to an interview,

474
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
they understand better

475
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
what they can build.

476
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Developers have

477
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
a specific point of view

478
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and how they expand the world.

479
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's important

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
that we don't dream

481
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
about design or product.

482
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Stories that are impossible.

483
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's great

484
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
when developers

485
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and stakeholders

486
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
get involved.

487
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's important

488
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
that they are accountable

489
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and that

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
they are the ones

491
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
who have to talk

492
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and sell

493
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and so on.

494
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a mutual effort.

495
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's not the case

496
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
that developers

497
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
do a lot of work

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and then come up with new

499
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
goals.

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's just

501
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that

502
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
this question

503
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
took me a while

504
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
to answer.

505
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I wanted to say that

506
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
if people...

507
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's easiest

508
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
to build things

509
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
without asking.

510
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We have to

511
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
do it quickly

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and we won't do research.

513
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Research lasts.

514
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Research is an effort.

515
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Research means more people.

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It means more meetings.

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Tell me,

518
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
does it pay off?

519
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Does it pay off to do research?

520
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Tell us.

521
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think that research

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
pays off the most.

523
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The best thing

524
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
that can happen is

525
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that you do research and you know

526
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
that no one has this problem

527
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and you are saved for years

528
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and years.

529
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm a bit afraid of that.

530
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's one thing

531
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
that

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
according to my experience

533
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
that research

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
has to be huge

535
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and that you never need

536
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
money and resources.

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
On the other hand,

538
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
we don't necessarily want to know

539
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
what people have to say.

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Also, a big part of it is

541
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
that

542
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
you need someone

543
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
who knows how to ask questions.

544
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That was a question

545
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
today.

546
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What if

547
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we go

548
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to an interview

549
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and people have a wish list

550
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and then we build a rocket?

551
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes.

552
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You can't take everything

553
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that people say

554
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
as a feature that they

555
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
will build.

556
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think that I wrote

557
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
that what they say is not what you will build.

558
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's just the input

559
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that you deconstruct

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and then you know

561
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
what the community wants.

562
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
How do you choose

563
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
people to include

564
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
in your research

565
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
product?

566
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Do you randomly sample people

567
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
or do you call the company's director?

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Who do you include?

569
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you include a website?

570
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Give us an example of people

571
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
you include in your research.

572
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It depends

573
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
from project to project.

574
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
For example, we at Caldeo

575
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
work on B2B and business applications.

576
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's often

577
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
a bit easier because

578
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
they are all business processes.

579
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You know where to find these people

580
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and you can ask them.

581
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
If you work as a consumer

582
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
for a business,

583
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
of course, you have a wider range.

584
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
On the other hand,

585
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you have

586
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
a closer access.

587
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You always

588
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
set goals

589
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
for which you build

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
in the beginning

591
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
or for which you plan to build.

592
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Then you look at whether you really build

593
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
a company.

594
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Is this my entire group?

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It often turns out

596
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
that this is a subset

597
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
of these people.

598
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We can target more clearly.

599
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's a great marketing coach

600
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
who knows exactly what to write.

601
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It helps a lot

602
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
if you know your audience.

603
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Audience, yes.

604
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,640
But do you always do this in a way for people who will pay in the end?

605
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,799
Is this a good indicator that you will pay for his development and you will give his priorities to the top, or...

606
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,799
I know it's a ungrateful question.

607
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,840
No, but I mean, yes, a real question.

608
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Yes.

609
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,760
Sometimes it's hard to define, or rather, it's hard to determine who will pay, right?

610
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,599
And as far as I know, we also have different business models, right?

611
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:45,840
Because in B2B it is often the case that the user is someone else's buyer.

612
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
But...

613
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Again...

614
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,040
It's important to know who you're developing a service for, right?

615
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Yes.

616
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:06,720
It's very important to know who is the one who will benefit the most, or rather, who you will solve this problem the best.

617
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:16,000
Because if you solve this problem well for this person, for people, for a group of people, it is very likely that they will pay for it.

618
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,360
But these are all things that you can check within research.

619
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:30,720
We have different methods of how we do it, from checking concepts to validation, to interviewing, to testing prototypes.

620
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:40,000
In fact, this whole product development is nothing more than setting up some hypotheses,

621
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,320
building something, right? We want something that is as valuable as possible.

622
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,559
We check the hypothesis, and then we put new hypotheses on the basis of what we have learned.

623
00:26:50,559 --> 00:27:00,800
In fact, you develop the product in a way that you make some small changes,

624
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:07,519
you put them out, you measure how they work, how people react,

625
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,320
and then you come back to the hypothesis, you check it, you implement it, and then you repeat the cycle.

626
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,919
This is the interactive approach to the development of digital stories in this way.

627
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,360
That's right.

628
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,479
When we first talked, I said that our podcast is MVP, and then you corrected me and said it was some other thing.

629
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,479
Tell me more about it.

630
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,479
It's MLP.

631
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:32,479
Minimal Lovable Product.

632
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,479
Yes, what is it?

633
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:36,479
There are two theses.

634
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:43,119
One is that we have to start at the beginning with MVP, which is the basic core functionality.

635
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:49,839
Then it comes a little more from the design, that the product has to be a little more lovable,

636
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:56,399
so that the user can use it, and that it is not just a basic core functionality,

637
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,360
but that you already think a little about what are the flows, what color is it,

638
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:09,199
how can we do some small things to make the use of it more pleasant.

639
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,160
Yes, ok.

640
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,479
So I think you definitely did this for Grodno.

641
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,479
We are somewhere, but I don't know.

642
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:18,479
Ok, tell me what is the next stage?

643
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:25,039
For MVP, MLP, what is the next stage?

644
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,639
When will you say, we are no longer MVP, we are now a product?

645
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
I mean,

646
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,320
is there a phase when you say, ok, now we have made a real product,

647
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,440
we will now only make small incremental changes?

648
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Does this phase exist?

649
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,440
In my experience, when I worked on a lot of different products,

650
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,919
the big fear was that we were going to do MVP,

651
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,639
then we did all that research,

652
00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:02,399
and then at some stage, someone who was maybe a decision maker before the story,

653
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,160
said, ok, now we want to put 100,000 users in this MVP.

654
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,520
Do you know how to get over this gap,

655
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,239
or how do you make this transition to a real product?

656
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,239
If you understand what I'm saying.

657
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:22,799
Yes, I understand.

658
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,799
I don't know if I have the best answer,

659
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,079
but in the ideal world,

660
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,079
it would look like you are building MVP,

661
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,119
then you find out approximately how many users there are,

662
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,119
in a certain time period.

663
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,640
MVP is built quickly and has its limitations.

664
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:53,119
Recently, we had a really good talk on this topic at Drinks,

665
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,959
where we talked about how MVP works with no-code tools.

666
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:04,959
Just because it's really about the validation of the concept,

667
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:11,920
and at some point, you really have to put the MVP aside,

668
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,679
and maybe not look at it from scratch,

669
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,679
but put something new on it.

670
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,679
We can go back to what you said,

671
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,440
that the inclusion of developers in the development phase

672
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
is what helps.

673
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
The developers say, look,

674
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
the constraints of what we are going to do are

675
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
that there can be a maximum of 5 users,

676
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
and that everyone is from the same folder.

677
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
That's right.

678
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Before I ask you more about the common language and toolset,

679
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,440
tell me a little more about the decision-making.

680
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
I think you touched on that as well.

681
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
There was also an analogy on Steve Jobs.

682
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Can you tell us about that, please?

683
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Because it's very important to me.

684
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,440
A big part of our job is decision-making,

685
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
which is the acceptance of a bunch of decisions

686
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
based on some full insights

687
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
that you get from different directions.

688
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
How do you decide that one direction is right,

689
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
or that two directions are right?

690
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,440
And then there's the example of Steve Jobs,

691
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,440
who always wears a black turtleneck and blue jeans,

692
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,440
because it reduces the number of decisions

693
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,440
that he made on a daily basis.

694
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
And it's true that we have more decisions

695
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
on the day we have to make.

696
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
We have less headspace,

697
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
or rather, when we are influenced,

698
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
we make worse decisions.

699
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,440
And the first step for making good decisions

700
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
is headspace,

701
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
which means that you can,

702
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
that you are capable,

703
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
that you are able...

704
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
To somehow focus your mind

705
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
on what the decision today is,

706
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
that we have to make.

707
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
And the other part of that is

708
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
that we lack a repetitive understanding

709
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
of what those decisions mean.

710
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
And now, again, we don't have

711
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
that common language

712
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
that we used at the beginning

713
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
to really understand

714
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,440
what a decision really means.

715
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,440
And here comes the product trio again.

716
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
We have all three perspectives.

717
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
We have product, we have design,

718
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
we have development.

719
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
All three are important.

720
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,440
And here we have to understand each other very well

721
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
and understand the implications

722
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,440
that come with every decision.

723
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
And the problem is that

724
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
we don't have time in teams

725
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,440
and we don't have that common language.

726
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Okay.

727
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
Let's go a little further

728
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
into the common language

729
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
that we speak.

730
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I expected at the beginning

731
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
when I heard you,

732
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
what kind of God would you imagine?

733
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
What kind of God

734
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,440
could that common language be?

735
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
And very simply,

736
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
where do you decide

737
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
what is the easiest,

738
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
what is the most expensive

739
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
for all stakeholders?

740
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Yes, visual beings.

741
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Visualization.

742
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
All the basics,

743
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
why we prototype,

744
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
why show design in prototyping.

745
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Not only design,

746
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
prototyping is not a new thing.

747
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
When we start building things together,

748
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
and when we start looking at them together,

749
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
it's much better

750
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
than just talking to each other.

751
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Because with words,

752
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
one word for me

753
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
means something completely different

754
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
because we don't have the same experiences,

755
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
because in another experience,

756
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
another upbringing.

757
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,440
And it's hard to put exactly the same thing in your head.

758
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Especially if it's about

759
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
business applications,

760
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
complex business systems.

761
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
That's right.

762
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
And then to transfer it

763
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
so that everyone understands the same thing,

764
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
it's quite impossible.

765
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,440
And now we can visualize these things,

766
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
but we always pay more attention

767
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
to the fact that

768
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
sometimes it's a thing,

769
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
I don't know, when you have a problem,

770
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
how to solve it,

771
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
you can't change it.

772
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
You can't just put an example

773
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
on the board and say,

774
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
okay, let's do it now.

775
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Let's draw.

776
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
I'm not talking about

777
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
drawing interfaces,

778
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
screens,

779
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
but drawing flowcharts,

780
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
putting things on posts,

781
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
moving posts left and right,

782
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
looking for patterns.

783
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
No matter how hard

784
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
it is,

785
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
we have enough understanding

786
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
for something

787
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
to make a decision.

788
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
That means,

789
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
in your work,

790
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
you probably draw a lot of sketches,

791
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
probably flowcharts,

792
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I understood that.

793
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Between your slides,

794
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
you also showed paper prototypes,

795
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
which I found very interesting.

796
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Yes.

797
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
If I understood correctly,

798
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
at MESSI,

799
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
you made prototypes

800
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
out of cardboard.

801
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Digital cardboard.

802
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Can you explain that?

803
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
We had an example

804
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
when we had a concept

805
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
of an app,

806
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
drawing flowcharts,

807
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
a process within

808
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
healthcare.

809
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
I was thinking,

810
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
for two days,

811
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
that I would do it,

812
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
because it was

813
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
powerful,

814
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
but in a different program.

815
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
At that moment,

816
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
I was thinking,

817
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
how can I make it

818
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
show

819
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
the interaction

820
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
I need to understand,

821
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
which has many possibilities,

822
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
in an interactive prototype.

823
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
I didn't like that.

824
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
We had a reservation

825
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
for a healthcare in Gorna Vasa.

826
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
I was like,

827
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
I have to have something.

828
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
What is the easiest way?

829
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
It was

830
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
to make out of cardboard

831
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,440
some kind of computer screen

832
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
to show

833
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
our healthcare.

834
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Then I had prepared

835
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
rubber bands

836
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
out of cut post-its.

837
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
When it clicked,

838
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
I imagined

839
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
what would happen next.

840
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
From the beginning.

841
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
It was the best.

842
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
The rubber band was

843
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
made in Unigur,

844
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
and it confirmed our concept

845
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
that it would work that way.

846
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
That was it.

847
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
And today,

848
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
it's boring,

849
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
you document it, break the prototype

850
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
and you have a great result.

851
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
You probably ate

852
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
months and months of development.

853
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
In the same story.

854
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
In the same story.

855
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
I wrote here

856
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
that you use

857
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
a tool called Breaking Stuff Down.

858
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
You mentioned

859
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
that it's a tool

860
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
that you use.

861
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
I hope I pronounced it right.

862
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
You break the concepts

863
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
with the stakeholders

864
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
so that everyone gets the same understanding.

865
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
What do you think about it?

866
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
How do you do it?

867
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Now,

868
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
how do you do it?

869
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
You have a tool,

870
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
for example,

871
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Customer Journey

872
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
or Customer Journey Map

873
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
is a tool where

874
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
you get things from research

875
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
and then you map them

876
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
and then you look

877
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
at what we still lack,

878
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
what we still don't understand.

879
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
It's a powerful tool.

880
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
But

881
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
everything we start

882
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
is Breaking Stuff Down.

883
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
So,

884
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
you go to an interview,

885
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
you get, I don't know,

886
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
two pages of content

887
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
and then you have to

888
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
fit it in.

889
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
This part is still there,

890
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
this is relevant for that,

891
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
this is for marketing,

892
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
and then

893
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
you make

894
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
a sense-making.

895
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
And a lot of times

896
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
we use digital whiteboards

897
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
like Summiro,

898
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Fake Jam, there are a million of them.

899
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
And you have everything

900
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
in one place

901
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
so that you can see the patterns.

902
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
And more often,

903
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
even at these meetings,

904
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
we still

905
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
talk at the end.

906
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
You don't just

907
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
write and look at them,

908
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
but

909
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
now we have a collective picture.

910
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
And that's the goal of everything.

911
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
Ok.

912
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
I have one more question

913
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
and then we'll move it to a radio station

914
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
in Porto.

915
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
I asked you

916
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
about writing

917
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
some stories

918
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
or documentation

919
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
like that.

920
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Now,

921
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
we're talking about visual.

922
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Ok, I get it.

923
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Is it enough

924
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
to tell people that everyone can

925
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
start doing the same things?

926
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Where do you start

927
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
writing documents that

928
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
are not yet taken?

929
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
I mean,

930
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
I think I've learned

931
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
that developers enjoy

932
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
writing programs,

933
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
coding, products,

934
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
but writing documentation

935
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
is the average,

936
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
or most developers enjoy it.

937
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Then, on the other hand,

938
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
it's also a defense of the documentation.

939
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Give us

940
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
a smart world.

941
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
What would you say

942
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
is the smartest thing to write?

943
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
That's the question.

944
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
What would be the smartest thing to write?

945
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
To be defended.

946
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
I know, I know.

947
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
There was a catch at the end.

948
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
I mean,

949
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
at the beginning, I can say

950
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
that I think it's bad.

951
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
There are really few people

952
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
who enjoy writing documentation.

953
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Even foreign designers.

954
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Ok, yeah.

955
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Terrible.

956
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
It depends on the team.

957
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Some teams,

958
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
or I would say, the bigger the team,

959
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
the more documentation

960
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
they have,

961
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
because it's harder for us.

962
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
You have to have more details.

963
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Is it a combination

964
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
of having

965
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
a user flow chart,

966
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
and in Figma,

967
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
what each block means,

968
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
what the interactions are,

969
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
or is it some kind of a jury,

970
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
in epics and stories?

971
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
I believe

972
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
that every team

973
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
has to figure out

974
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
how to make it better.

975
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Because every team

976
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
works differently.

977
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Now,

978
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
there were great collaborations,

979
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
when you were a designer and a developer,

980
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
but you didn't need

981
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
a jury.

982
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
The designer didn't fully understand,

983
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
and things happened.

984
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Probably it also depends on the size of the team.

985
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
That's great.

986
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
I mean, the bigger the team,

987
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
the longer

988
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
things take.

989
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
I think we all know that.

990
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
You answered well.

991
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
I would say

992
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,439
that maybe you write

993
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,439
some small paragraphs,

994
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:09,439
so that the stakeholders

995
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,439
who don't know how to program,

996
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:13,439
don't understand design,

997
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,439
understand a bit more.

998
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:17,439
Maybe you also

999
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:19,439
write user stories

1000
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,439
together,

1001
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,439
and maybe that's all

1002
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,439
the concept of those user stories

1003
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:27,439
tells.

1004
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:29,439
I'm following your last question.

1005
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:31,439
OK.

1006
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:33,439
For example, the process

1007
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:35,439
we're working on with Kyle,

1008
00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:37,439
we work a lot with him,

1009
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,439
and it's like this,

1010
00:42:39,439 --> 00:42:41,439
who writes the user stories,

1011
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,439
who in the team,

1012
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:45,439
is it a designer,

1013
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,439
is it a product manager,

1014
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,439
what exactly do the stories have to be,

1015
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:51,439
I'm very much like

1016
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:53,439
the quality of a user story

1017
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:55,439
from my point of view,

1018
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,439
has a specific design.

1019
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:59,439
While others say,

1020
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:01,439
no, you just write a bit.

1021
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:03,439
So we're combining those things

1022
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:05,439
with the fact that

1023
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:07,439
we include

1024
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:09,439
development as soon as possible.

1025
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,439
So the day before,

1026
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,439
I don't know, I'm going to make some

1027
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:15,439
design ideas,

1028
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,439
I'm sitting with the developer

1029
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:19,439
where I'm going to compete,

1030
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:21,439
we go to the stakeholders,

1031
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:23,439
we confirm it,

1032
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:25,439
we finish it, whatever.

1033
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:27,439
Once again, I sit with the developer,

1034
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,439
I define things,

1035
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:31,439
I solve it, then it goes to the story.

1036
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:33,439
And then we sit again

1037
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:35,439
to go through everything.

1038
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:37,439
So you can start

1039
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:39,439
working on it today.

1040
00:43:39,439 --> 00:43:41,439
OK, my last question

1041
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,439
is this.

1042
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:45,439
Let's say that most of us

1043
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:47,439
are developers.

1044
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:49,439
What can you

1045
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:51,439
give to developers

1046
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:53,439
around the world?

1047
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:55,439
How can you make it easier

1048
00:43:55,439 --> 00:43:57,439
to work with them?

1049
00:43:57,439 --> 00:43:59,439
To make it easier to work with them

1050
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:01,439
so they can contribute more

1051
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,439
to the whole flow?

1052
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:05,439
Can you maybe add that now?

1053
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:07,439
Yes, I really want

1054
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:09,439
both for developers

1055
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,439
and for designers

1056
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:13,439
to get involved in this process.

1057
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,439
So that

1058
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:17,439
we're not the only ones

1059
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:19,439
at the end who are

1060
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:21,439
putting together things that others

1061
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:23,439
order for us.

1062
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:25,439
Because I think we all have

1063
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:27,439
these specific views and perspectives.

1064
00:44:27,439 --> 00:44:29,439
So for developers,

1065
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:31,439
let's get involved

1066
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:33,439
as soon as possible.

1067
00:44:33,439 --> 00:44:35,439
As many times

1068
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,439
as you can,

1069
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:39,439
ask us,

1070
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,439
help us do things,

1071
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:43,439
whatever it is,

1072
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:45,439
help us intelligibly.

1073
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:49,439
Because a lot of times

1074
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,439
those return calls

1075
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,439
are just

1076
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:55,439
some kind of frustration.

1077
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:57,439
When a developer

1078
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,439
builds what someone ordered

1079
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:01,439
and then it wasn't cool

1080
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:03,439
or too complex

1081
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,439
and designers on the other hand

1082
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,439
suffer because

1083
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,439
things don't look the way we designed them.

1084
00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:13,439
So as much as possible

1085
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:15,439
in this communication

1086
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:17,439
I can say for sure

1087
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,439
that designers and

1088
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:21,439
producers want

1089
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:23,439
this perspective

1090
00:45:23,439 --> 00:45:25,439
and if you give us

1091
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:27,439
better products.

1092
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:29,439
Yes, and their lives

1093
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:31,439
will be easier.

1094
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:33,439
Okay.

1095
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,439
Amadea, I thank you

1096
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:37,439
for being a guest

1097
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:39,439
of this ad hoc episode in Grodno.

1098
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:41,439
Thank you for having us.

1099
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,439

1101
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:47,439
I would also like to thank

Trifas who supports us.

1103
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,439
I would also like to thank

1104
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:53,439
Kaldi.

1105
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:55,439
Thank you for being with us

1106
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:57,439
and thank you for inviting us
