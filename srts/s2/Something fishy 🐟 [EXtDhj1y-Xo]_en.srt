1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here it is. And now...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Every second is valuable in this journey.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Is this the intro?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Or will we start soon?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What intro? Is that it?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I mean...

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
At the beginning...

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Dear viewers, this is it.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And with me are...

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And with me are...

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Andras and Andras2.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With me are...

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Andras and Andras2.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
With me are...

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Andras and Andras2.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Together, Andras2.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we've been here for 3 hours.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Don't say anything.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It doesn't matter.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a matter of context.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're filming a blog of two losers.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Two losers.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What did you give up?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I gave up my ether.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Because...

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No, it's too obvious.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll explain to you what ether is.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Anyway.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Today we're going to film...

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know how many.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
About 35-40 episodes.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In December.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today is the shooting day.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we've already filmed one episode.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So we've already filmed one episode.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a well-known topic.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But we decided to expand it today.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But we decided to expand it today.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We're going to be freelancers.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We're going to be freelancers.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're going to be freelancers.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's how I understood it.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's how I understood it.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you heard in the last episode

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
how to get a remote job.

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you heard in the last episode

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
how to get a remote job.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All three of us in this office

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
all three of us in this office

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
manage remote jobs.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We live the life of

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
we live the life of

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
some professional workers.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Remote workers.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What else would be an example?

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'd have to say

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm a consultant for myself.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm a consultant for myself.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm a remote worker at 4Hire.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
First of all,

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
First of all,

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we're entrepreneurs.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We have our own

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
entity,

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
we have our own entity,

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
we have a website.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
a website.

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not the same thing.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
A website or an assignment?

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Assignments and websites.

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Assignments and websites.

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
A website comes and goes,

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but a website is probably

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
delayed and delayed all the time.

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's say there are two examples.

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's say there are two examples.

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But above all,

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
it's one of the elements

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
of the ideal dimension.

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It means that if you're

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
a singer for a long time,

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
then you have to get a job.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you're a remote worker,

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
then it's a different game.

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you work for someone for three months,

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you work for someone for three months,

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because you have a project with them,

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
what is it then?

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think you work as a remote worker

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think you work as a remote worker

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and then you have other jobs.

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and then you have other jobs.

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you have them,

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
they give you jobs.

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
they give you jobs.

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now,

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now,

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the question is,

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
what are you interested in?

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Work-life balance?

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Looking for a partner?

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Maintaining a partner?

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You put a mastodon on the table.

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You put a mastodon on the table.

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We talked about

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
what to talk about.

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We talked about what to talk about.

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know.

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know.

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know.

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He said you are 10 years in this business.

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He said you are 10 years in this business.

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He said you are 10 years in this business.

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What are you doing?

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What challenges have you found?

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He started...

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He started...

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's start with that.

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
My main task was

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
my main task was

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
space.

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I joined a co-working.

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I joined a co-working.

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I joined a co-working.

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I didn't want to work at home.

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You have a

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you have a contract

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you have a contract

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you have a contract

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
you have a contract

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
but you lack

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
a social contact

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
coffee,

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
food and so on.

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I needed

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to find

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to find

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
a place.

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have been here for 9 years.

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We have been here for 9 years.

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I needed

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
to find

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
a place.

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I needed to find a place.

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I needed to find a place.

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
My first contact

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
was with a Slovenian company.

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
was with a Slovenian company.

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
was with a Slovenian company.

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We got a contract

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and I started working

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
as a Slovenian.

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
as a Slovenian.

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was my first contact.

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The contract is remote.

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Communication is remote.

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The contract came to Slovenia.

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We planned and drew.

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You went there?

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I went there.

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
One of the

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
most memorable

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
moments of the scene

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I worked for

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The Labs.

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It was a project.

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
At the beginning of my career

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was sent to England.

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was sent to England.

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I lived in London.

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I worked abroad.

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I established a relationship.

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I learned about the culture.

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I learned about the culture.

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I learned about the culture.

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It was my first contact

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
with the world.

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was my first contact

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
with the world.

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Later

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I looked for

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
a job abroad.

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I worked for them.

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I had an arrangement.

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I had an arrangement.

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I went to England

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
once a month for a week.

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I worked for them

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
for a week.

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I went back to Slovenia

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and worked here.

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You were already

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
on your own.

195
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
For a while

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I worked

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
from home.

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I worked in

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
cafes, bookstores.

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I worked in

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
different setups.

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then I came

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to Giga Tronce.

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to Giga Tronce.

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There were more of us

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
who worked as freelancers.

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I started to work as a writer.

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If I was

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
alone

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
with my wife

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I had more

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
peace at home.

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If I have a family

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
with three children

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
it is harder to get

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
a job.

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you have children

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
it is harder to concentrate.

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you don't have

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a physical space

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
where you can work in peace

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
it is not a problem.

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You will have

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
space and peace

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and you will teach

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
your neighbors

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that when you are at home

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you are also at work.

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are not at home

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but you are at work.

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can explain this to your partners

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
when they grow up.

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you have small children

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
they won't understand

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
that you need a meeting

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
or whatever.

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This part can be

239
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
very challenging.

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Children just don't understand

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and you can

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
explain it to them.

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You?

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When I was a student

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I started working

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
with students.

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We mostly worked

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
remotely.

250
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There were

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
millions of projects.

252
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn't have

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that much cash.

254
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I didn't have that much cash

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and I worked

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
locally.

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't like

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
working

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
at home.

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I hate

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
having

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
a space

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
where I work.

264
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's weird when you talk to people

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and you say you work remotely.

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
People say you work from home.

267
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I say I work remotely for lunch

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because I don't work from home.

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think that's interesting.

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, that's it.

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You mentioned

272
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that you

273
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
try to work

274
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
locally.

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Also in Tuini.

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
As a digital nomad.

278
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Did that

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
handle you?

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You were more of a developer

281
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
or a system developer.

282
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I mean

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
if you have

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
debates,

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
if you write documents,

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
if you have an appointment

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
or a meeting

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and you don't need

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
a deep focus on work

290
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
when you can focus

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
on a very

292
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
difficult thing.

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I need peace

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
or less distraction.

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If I have a work

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that I can edit

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and put it in a feature

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
or anywhere

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and I practiced that.

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Then there are

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
challenges.

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
For example, if you have to

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
look at the time in a feature

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you have to look at the time.

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you go to the toilet

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
it's good to check

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
if you will be able to do it.

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There are some practical challenges.

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Internet.

310
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Will mobile

311
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
or 5G be enough

312
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
or will Wi-Fi be enough?

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Public

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wi-Fi

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
will be needed.

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
These are some challenges.

317
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
For deep work

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I need challenges.

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I never

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
worked in a local

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and I never opened a laptop.

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I didn't

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
have the intention

324
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to work all day

325
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
in a cafe.

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I studied that a lot.

327
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
When someone says

328
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
you work in a local

329
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you are in the center

330
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and you work there.

331
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I worked in a hotel in Ljubljana.

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There were no guests in the hotel

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
at that time.

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It was a small motel.

335
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I told

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
all the guys

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that they were very happy

338
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and their superiors were very happy.

339
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I already had a visa

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and I came to them.

341
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I didn't work there.

342
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was a student

343
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and I calculated

344
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that it will pay off.

345
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There was no culture of co-working.

346
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I didn't want

347
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
to work at home.

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because I

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
procrastinated at home

350
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and didn't do anything.

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I had a friend.

352
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I talked

353
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
to her

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and I worked.

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If you can work remotely

356
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
it wasn't my job

357
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to work remotely.

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now it's not.

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If you have interviews

360
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
or if you optimize some business processes

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
you can't work remotely.

362
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I try

363
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
not to work remotely

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
because it stops you

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
because it's a travel time

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and you can't work remotely.

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I worked in the industry

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and you can't

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
connect everything in series

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to one job.

371
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I mean, you can

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
but you can't

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
because you have other problems.

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If it was a more

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
classic development

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
like web development and programming

377
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I worked remotely.

378
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They were German

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
employees

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and students.

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
With time

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I mean

383
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
now I look at it like this.

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I have an SP

385
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and it's not a business

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
but I work with

387
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
a company which has

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
very funny implications.

389
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
In the contract it says

390
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
if you break this NDA, it's this and that.

391
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a bit different than

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
when you go to a company in the USA

393
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
because there are differences.

394
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Now the cost I pay

395
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
for co-working

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
is the cost of a restaurant.

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I look at it like this.

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's an interesting thing

399
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
when I don't understand people.

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I have a computer

401
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and I rent a space where I work.

402
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
People do a lot of optimizations

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
to work from home,

404
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to have low expenses,

405
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to have their own computer.

406
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When people tell me

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you have to pay this and that

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
per month for a computer

409
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
it's easy.

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You don't have to worry

411
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
about the expenses.

412
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You have to try

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
to see if it works

414
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and if it doesn't

415
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you can fix it.

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I look at it differently.

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's the cost of a restaurant.

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If I don't have amortization

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
it's a bit

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
like a restaurant.

421
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
How do you

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
look at the space

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and fix it?

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You are now

425
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
94 out of 97

426
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and you can start a new job.

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
How do you find that balance

428
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
when you were

429
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
in a family with kids

430
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
or when you were single?

431
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I can hijack it.

432
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I will tell you about it later.

433
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I heard

434
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
two good stories.

435
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
One is relevant

436
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
for WeWork.

437
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
A company

438
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that went bankrupt

439
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
this week.

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I can mention it.

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We went to see a documentary.

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Adam.

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He is an interesting character.

444
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I have the experience

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that I was in America

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
with WeWork writers

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and in London.

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It was an interesting model.

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They wanted to

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
unite the community

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and the mobile

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
style of work.

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You will travel

454
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
around the world

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and you go from one writer to another.

456
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's interesting.

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It was interesting

458
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and

459
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
it was a mantra

460
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
or a vibe

461
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
for the company.

462
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If you were in a start-up

463
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or in WeWork

464
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
where were you?

465
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You would expect

466
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that if you are a new

467
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and hip player

468
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
you have to be there.

469
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There were

470
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
unicorns

471
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and unicorns came from them.

472
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I was in WeWork

473
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
which was interesting.

474
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You had a card

475
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and you could...

476
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
When did it come?

477
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't remember.

478
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You didn't start

479
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
or work there.

480
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It was a premium service.

481
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It was in Resnica.

482
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You had

483
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
an idea

484
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
which you have today

485
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
in a modern office.

486
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You had

487
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
phone booths for Skype

488
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and smaller ones.

489
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You had bigger offices.

490
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If the company

491
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
needed more space

492
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
you could scale the office.

493
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I understand everything.

494
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It was good but it doesn't work.

495
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Financially...

496
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
For example,

497
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Polygon

498
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
was in a degraded area

499
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and it had its price.

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
WeWork

501
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
was in a premium location.

502
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They had a different

503
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
clientele.

504
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They had so much

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
injection of capital

506
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that they went bankrupt.

507
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You can say it was a good idea

508
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it's a franchise

509
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
you can travel a lot.

510
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
As a user...

511
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
As a user I can tell you

512
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that at some point

513
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
it became too expensive

514
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and we looked for alternatives.

515
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
As a user it was good

516
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
but at some point

517
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
there was a technical problem

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and they told us to go

519
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
5 streets ahead

520
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and that was it.

521
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The worst thing

522
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
for me was

523
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
going to a cafe

524
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
or a pub

525
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
in a shared space

526
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and you had people there

527
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
who were probably

528
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
doing similar things

529
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and you could talk to them

530
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and exchange ideas.

531
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
At the beginning it's interesting

532
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and you see similar people

533
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
but you have space.

534
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sometimes it seems like

535
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
our or any other co-working

536
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
is the same.

537
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You have a social contact

538
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
where you have

539
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
some people who

540
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
either do similar things

541
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
or solve similar problems.

542
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Which is really bad.

543
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because if you're in a pub

544
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and you can't hear each other

545
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you won't get to know

546
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
only the monks

547
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
or the clergymen

548
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
who write in JavaScript

549
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but you'll get to know other people.

550
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I understand that

551
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What I want to say

552
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
is that I've been watching you

553
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
for 7 years

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and we're always the same.

555
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I always want to meet

556
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
someone else.

557
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But everything changes.

558
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Shoutout to Virak.

559
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah, we get to meet each other

560
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and it's great.

561
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I remember

562
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
in Bali

563
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I was in a co-working

564
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
which was

565
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
even though

566
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
it wasn't exactly a co-working

567
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
we had a few of them

568
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
it was a smaller part

569
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but it was

570
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
in Bali

571
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
on a warm day

572
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and you went to work in a pub

573
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the pub was

574
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
some kind of a hut

575
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
made of bamboo

576
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and you set up your laptop

577
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and there was rice in the field

578
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and you saw the sheep stealing the rice

579
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but

580
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that's not important to me anymore.

581
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, of course.

582
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But I work.

583
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That would be

584
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
my statistic

585
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to meet someone else in a pub.

586
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I work.

587
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's true that you also have

588
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
different people doing different things.

589
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I worked

590
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
when you have to watch Timezone

591
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and I worked

592
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
when I was in the office

593
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and I needed some deep work

594
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
so people went home

595
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and I started to work

596
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
under the same Timezone.

597
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I also heard about robberies

598
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
when they were stealing the rice.

599
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So you had distractions.

600
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, I had distractions

601
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but

602
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
maybe

603
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
like you said

604
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
you also meet different people

605
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
when they come to the pub.

606
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
In V-Work they were more professional

607
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
because they were

608
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
in the pub

609
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
they were more

610
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
let's say lifestyle entrepreneurs

611
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
or people who moved to the pub

612
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
so they could

613
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
cook or something.

614
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
German nomads.

615
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes, German nomads who were exiting

616
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
or I don't know

617
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
what they were doing

618
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and they were rich and they were looking for a successor.

619
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That was also interesting.

620
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Also the service

621
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
breakfasts, dinners

622
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't know what they were doing.

623
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There were so many cooks

624
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
who came to work.

625
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Those are two stories

626
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I wanted to share with you

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
to put it in context.

628
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You can work anywhere

629
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but only at home

630
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
if you work remotely.

631
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What was it like

632
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
working with Covid?

633
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Did you work with Covid?

634
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You are asking

635
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
because you have children.

636
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes, I was with my wife.

637
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I had a child

638
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
so I don't know.

639
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I have PTSD.

640
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't know.

641
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We were lucky

642
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
because

643
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
all the employees

644
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
for whom I worked

645
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
were

646
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
quite

647
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
perceptive

648
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
of the situation.

649
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Then

650
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
in the household

651
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
one elder

652
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
can take over

653
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the children

654
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
while the other

655
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
takes over the service

656
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and then the roles change.

657
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
With a little effort

658
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
everything is possible.

659
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In my case,

660
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I didn't feel

661
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
it was tricky.

662
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't have

663
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
any...

664
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You don't remember?

665
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You want to forget.

666
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You gave me a lot of time

667
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to think about it.

668
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
My children were

669
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
2,19?

670
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
2,20.

671
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I had a very young child

672
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and my wife was at home

673
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
with the child.

674
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We combined it.

675
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We were at home.

676
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What did you experience?

677
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We combined it.

678
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We were in the same apartment.

679
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I worked in the children's room.

680
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The children slept in the other room.

681
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You are reborn.

682
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I think

683
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
that those of us

684
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
who are remote workers

685
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
or contractors

686
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
have to communicate

687
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
with the contractor.

688
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It was a must.

689
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I think that

690
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
everyone who is

691
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
a part-time worker

692
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
was only sent

693
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
to work from home.

694
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The work could

695
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
still be done.

696
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I feel

697
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
that there was

698
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
less obedience

699
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and understanding.

700
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I had a chance to see it.

701
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I can hear a train.

702
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's December.

703
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You are in a bad mood.

704
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm in a very bad mood.

705
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You probably had

706
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
a different experience.

707
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think

708
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
that all of you

709
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
who were without a child

710
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
had a different experience.

711
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It was a awesome time

712
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
for people

713
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
who are very introverted.

714
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
We don't have to go anywhere.

715
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We are at home.

716
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We have a lot of time.

717
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We don't have to go anywhere.

718
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Maybe from the beginning.

719
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I believe so.

720
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It was the same for me when I was at home, even if there was no COVID.

721
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I was alone, I just started to watch out.

722
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There was a problem that there wasn't that many people at home,

723
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and at that time we had a full house.

724
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's tricky when there are two people.

725
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I just started to watch out.

726
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Before that, I started doing shows.

727
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
At home, I was used to seeing things differently.

728
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
After I stopped doing shows,

729
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I was used to seeing things differently.

730
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It seems to have changed.

731
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
For me, it's different.

732
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I work too much, but it's not sustainable.

733
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's not a quality to work 12 hours a day.

734
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
If you work 12 hours a day, you'll work 10 days, and then you'll die.

735
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We can go into that debate.

736
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I watched out.

737
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
When COVID came, I'd been working remotely for almost 10 years.

738
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I watched out for one thing that seemed to me

739
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
to be the only thing I could do remotely.

740
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
People who were in the position

741
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
that they had to work remotely,

742
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
they prepared a lot of things.

743
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They were like,

744
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
how are we going to solve this?

745
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It was like a warm water.

746
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It was like a warm water.

747
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I remember a middle manager

748
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
who said,

749
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
now I see how much you need information

750
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
that I didn't know was important.

751
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I understand that.

752
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
When we expect you to be a team player,

753
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
you don't see much of yourself on the bench.

754
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I understand that it's a problem

755
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
how I engage you remotely,

756
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
how I involve you in the team,

757
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and that you're worried about being overlooked.

758
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There are things like that.

759
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
For someone like him,

760
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
it was the first time in his life

761
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
that he saw how we work.

762
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I had the same situation.

763
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I worked remotely.

764
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I and two other employees were remote.

765
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The rest were in the office.

766
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Before COVID happened,

767
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I was mostly in the team.

768
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If I didn't ask directly,

769
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
or attend meetings,

770
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
it was mostly on the sidewalks,

771
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
or in small coffee shops.

772
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I was always worried

773
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
that they would stop me.

774
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There were no such things there.

775
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
When COVID happened,

776
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
everyone realized that

777
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
they had to share information.

778
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Not only did they realize

779
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that they had to,

780
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
they realized the value of being there.

781
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I also had the experience

782
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
when the company went from

783
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
non-remote to remote.

784
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
When you make a decision,

785
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
they prepare it in the office

786
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and don't write it down.

787
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Maybe a week later,

788
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
the decision was approved.

789
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Maybe it was a strategic decision,

790
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
but they weren't logged in.

791
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Let's go back to the work-life balance.

792
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Let me ask you the same question.

793
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
In reality,

794
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
your day goes by

795
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
very similarly to the day

796
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
of every white-collar worker.

797
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You wake up in the morning,

798
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
wash your hands,

799
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and then go home.

800
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yes, but when we talk here,

801
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
most of us work

802
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
for one employee.

803
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I usually start with a contract

804
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
for multiple employees at once.

805
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's a challenge

806
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
how to divide the work.

807
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I try to communicate

808
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
with the employees.

809
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I try to work with employees.

810
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't have the context

811
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
of switching between employees.

812
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's like multitasking.

813
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It takes a lot of time

814
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
to switch from one person to another.

815
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You have to wait for information

816
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
from someone else.

817
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The context switching

818
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
takes a lot of time.

819
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I tried to train my employees

820
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
in a way

821
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
so that they are satisfied

822
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
with the work I do.

823
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
On Thursdays, I have someone else.

824
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
On Fridays, I have someone else.

825
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Maybe we'll get to Friday.

826
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I had a slightly different hack.

827
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It was more like

828
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
you are now someone

829
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
on the side of the counter.

830
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You look like someone

831
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
on the side of the counter.

832
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Everything was urgent

833
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and everything was necessary.

834
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It all depends on how you prepare

835
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the contract, how you communicate.

836
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You don't have to judge me.

837
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What I noticed

838
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
is that I didn't group the contracts

839
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
by day

840
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but by meetings.

841
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
All the meetings took place in one day.

842
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I had dedicated days

843
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
that were only for meetings.

844
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I didn't have other days

845
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
for deep work.

846
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I could take 4 hours in a row

847
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and I knew that those 4 hours

848
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
would be filled with messages

849
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and I tried to communicate

850
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and adjust the rhythm

851
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
so that I could be the most focused

852
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and optimize how things went.

853
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I have a lot of free time.

854
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yes, because you work

855
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
for one contract.

856
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I always work for one contract.

857
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What you said about one contract

858
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
is that I have a project

859
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and I work for one contract.

860
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Then I have less workload

861
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and I don't have more contracts.

862
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
People say that I work for one contract

863
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
for years.

864
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I work for the project

865
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and I work for one contract.

866
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
People don't understand

867
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that I work for one contract

868
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
but I don't work full time for it.

869
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I work on my own projects.

870
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Does that make sense?

871
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yes, but how do you prioritize

872
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
your projects?

873
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I change for a project

874
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that I have to do.

875
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I learned that because

876
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
people change things

877
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and if you don't say

878
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that you work for a small project

879
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
to see if it fits you

880
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
it's not good.

881
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You can be very experienced

882
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and you have a professional attitude

883
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
but it just doesn't fit.

884
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Then I do something small

885
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and then I do a bigger project

886
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and I want it to be completed.

887
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I have a lot of risk.

888
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I can change management

889
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and I have a whole problem.

890
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It has to be completed

891
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
so that it doesn't happen

892
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
that Lada turned 90 degrees

893
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and we'll do something else.

894
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
From the context of a project

895
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
it can always be changed.

896
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's a project.

897
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
No, it's not like that.

898
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It can be changed

899
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
but management of expectation

900
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
is something else.

901
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I work for someone

902
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and if we can assign tasks

903
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
for example, if we have a legacy system

904
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
that's deprecated

905
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and we want to replace it

906
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
with Kubernetes for container orchestration

907
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
can you assign me tasks

908
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
outside of that scope?

909
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's part of the contract.

910
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The difference is

911
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
if you say I'm open to work

912
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
because I don't know how people imagine it.

913
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Let's be honest.

914
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm just asking

915
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
about the high level

916
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
how you organize your day

917
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and how you organize your week.

918
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
For me it's simple.

919
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In the morning I'm open

920
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and in the afternoon I'm not allowed to work.

921
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't want to talk about systems

922
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
because you can hear that a lot.

923
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
We do everything.

924
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
For a front-end developer

925
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
or someone who works on those things

926
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
they're probably not on-call.

927
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's a well-known concept to be on-call.

928
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's a funny thing.

929
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
How do you deal with it

930
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
because we're a small company

931
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and we all have to be on-call

932
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
so we can share the risk.

933
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
When you're a developer

934
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
you're always on-call.

935
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
If a company calls you

936
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
you have to say we're not working.

937
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I've never been on-call in my life.

938
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You know what a pager duty is?

939
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
If you have a pager duty

940
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you have to think about it.

941
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's even worse if you're implicitly on-call.

942
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That means you don't have any policies

943
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to make a system work.

944
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I learn from inventors

945
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
in four-change systems.

946
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
People understand you can't cover 24 hours

947
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
if you don't have four-change work.

948
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's a typical story

949
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
when you're on-call a lot.

950
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That's why I wanted to talk about it.

951
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That's why I'm a hoster.

952
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I don't work.

953
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
There can be some special requirements

954
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and I can work.

955
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
My good will allows me to work

956
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but that's the baseline.

957
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I've had that in my career

958
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
but it was also in the past.

959
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Different positions.

960
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Everyone was expecting it

961
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and there were expectations.

962
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I was responsible

963
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and didn't hide anything.

964
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You didn't go to the movies.

965
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Does that mean you went to the movies

966
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
with a laptop?

967
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
No, that means I had the laptop

968
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
close to me.

969
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
On-call doesn't mean

970
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
you have to do everything

971
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
in the next four minutes.

972
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
If I had to solve something

973
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
in the next hour,

974
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
the laptop was close enough.

975
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I was lucky

976
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
that I had a remote.

977
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I was using my laptop

978
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
with an UMTS card

979
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
3G and so on.

980
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I could open the laptop

981
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and work anywhere.

982
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There was a computer

983
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that came with mobile data

984
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
because I was part of it.

985
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I tried to compensate

986
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and take care of it.

987
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Work-life balance? No.

988
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You can't be on tier 1

989
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and be on-call.

990
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That's it.

991
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
How did you get out of that segment?

992
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You can tell us.

993
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
A few times it happened to me

994
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
that a client came to me

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and said,

996
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't know, holidays are coming.

997
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Maybe a little before the holidays.

998
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But people are still talking.

999
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Who will be on-call at that time?

1000
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We have to worry about the holidays.

1001
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
If you're in an e-commerce,

1002
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
it's a problem.

1003
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Who will be monitoring?

1004
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I have to make sure

1005
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
that everything is in order.

1006
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Otherwise, people come to me

1007
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and say, what are you doing?

1008
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
We'll put you on-call.

1009
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Hello, what are you doing?

1010
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The first answer is,

1011
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
sorry, we don't have a contract.

1012
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's a premium.

1013
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The second answer is,

1014
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'll be a team player.

1015
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I feel so responsible for the project

1016
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that I don't have to take responsibility

1017
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
to fix the system.

1018
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Maybe I don't know it enough.

1019
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's fully responsible.

1020
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I know that.

1021
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I have a certain number of members

1022
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
who talk about such situations.

1023
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's possible, even if I'm not

1024
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
directly in the position.

1025
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's possible for me to be called

1026
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
for an on-call, for example.

1027
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's possible, but I've noticed

1028
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
that it's not convenient for me

1029
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
to be called for a good money.

1030
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's not convenient for my pleasure.

1031
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
There's a limit.

1032
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Maybe I really can't do it.

1033
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
If someone listens to this work

1034
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and doesn't allow you to force them...

1035
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
No.

1036
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I mean, not force.

1037
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You have to agree politely.

1038
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
What are your expectations?

1039
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I've never been on-call,

1040
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
but I'm learning how to implement it.

1041
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's a bit weird.

1042
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
If you're a fire brigade,

1043
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
you have these four changes.

1044
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
If you want to cover weekends

1045
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and employees in 24-7,

1046
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
for example.

1047
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm not talking about firemen.

1048
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm talking about firemen in 24-7.

1049
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You can have a business

1050
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
in our sector,

1051
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
which is similar.

1052
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
You want to cover 24-7.

1053
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's not unique to our industry.

1054
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
No.

1055
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
If you're a fireman,

1056
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you can't cover firemen in 24-7.

1057
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You can't cover firemen in 24-7.

1058
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It's because one person...

1059
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I have this problem with employees.

1060
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Their assistant is more operational.

1061
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
One person can't do it

1062
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
because he'll be fired.

1063
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It doesn't mean he's active every day.

1064
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
He can't be prepared.

1065
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's like we're doing baby steps.

1066
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
People are in the service

1067
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
until the next shift.

1068
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
If you don't have four people

1069
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
on rotation,

1070
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
you can't prepare

1071
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
for such shifts.

1072
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's complicated.

1073
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
If you're a startup with two engineers,

1074
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
it's a global product.

1075
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You have to be on time.

1076
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
How are you going to do it?

1077
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
These are the problems.

1078
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I would be on call.

1079
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
My problem is that I've never been compensated.

1080
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I've always felt guilty

1081
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
because I was inexperienced.

1082
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I have a clear intention

1083
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's nice to be on call,

1084
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
but it has to be sustainable.

1085
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You have to be aware of it.

1086
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I've seen it many times.

1087
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
They delegate this task to juniors.

1088
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I've seen it.

1089
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
One thing we have to be aware of

1090
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
is what exactly is expected

1091
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
from you when you're on call.

1092
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
If you're on call as a DevOps,

1093
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
a cloud engineer,

1094
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
or an app player,

1095
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
whatever,

1096
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
you don't have to know how to fix it.

1097
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You don't have to know how to debug it.

1098
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You have to be aware of

1099
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
how the system will react.

1100
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
How are we going to deal with these problems?

1101
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
What can we do proactively?

1102
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Why are we on call?

1103
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You have two reasons why people are on call.

1104
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The first reason is that you have commercial damage.

1105
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Your business suffers and you lose money.

1106
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That's the number one reason.

1107
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You have it, but you don't.

1108
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Let's leave it as it is.

1109
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's a service level agreement.

1110
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You have your business partners

1111
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
who use your services.

1112
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
In the meantime,

1113
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the engineers will look at it and try to fix it.

1114
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The funniest thing is

1115
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
that in Slovenia we have a lot of...

1116
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We say,

1117
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
let's leave these people on call.

1118
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Why do we have them?

1119
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Maybe the business doesn't lose a lot of money.

1120
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Not a lot of e-commerce,

1121
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
multi-regional, longer hours.

1122
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
SLA is also very important.

1123
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The problem is that when you prepare

1124
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
on-call rotation, you don't know what to write in SLA.

1125
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It happened to me a lot.

1126
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I made a promise to myself

1127
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that I don't have to make plans

1128
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
for reliability.

1129
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't know what to write for God.

1130
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
A lot of times it says

1131
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
that an engineer will look at it for half an hour

1132
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and make an assessment.

1133
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's called response time.

1134
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's defined as a response time

1135
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
where you are aware

1136
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
that you took over,

1137
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
but it doesn't mean that you will fix it.

1138
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's a time when you took over the business.

1139
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It's often confused.

1140
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
People think it's a time

1141
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
when you have to fix it.

1142
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
If it says in SLA that it's half an hour

1143
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
for someone to take over,

1144
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
the engineer will look at it,

1145
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
track the SLA response,

1146
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
accept it, and start working on the basic triage.

1147
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It can be so trivial that he'll be alone.

1148
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Depending on the weather,

1149
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
he might wake up in the middle of the night.

1150
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Let's stop for a moment.

1151
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
If KPI put this here...

1152
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
KPI means

1153
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Key Performance Indicators.

1154
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Customer Satisfaction Factor.

1155
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It turns out that the customer

1156
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
is more satisfied

1157
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
if someone starts to talk to him,

1158
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
send him some emails,

1159
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and reply quickly,

1160
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
even if they didn't reply for a day.

1161
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
If they are aware that something is going on,

1162
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
they hear me,

1163
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
it's much more valuable than

1164
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
fixing it quickly.

1165
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You can attack the customer

1166
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
in this way.

1167
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's a good trade-off.

1168
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
My advice is

1169
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
not to get too toxic.

1170
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Try to learn from it.

1171
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Don't burn out just because

1172
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
things are working.

1173
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Not every cryptocurrency exchange

1174
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
will lose cash if something doesn't work.

1175
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That's a good example.

1176
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
In the past,

1177
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I had a situation

1178
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
where the customer

1179
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
doesn't know what he wants.

1180
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
He knows that he wants a long Ferrari,

1181
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and then you start to explain

1182
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
the high availability,

1183
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that the system must be resilient,

1184
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and if we go further,

1185
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
through the cloud,

1186
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
where a lot of equipment is added,

1187
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and everything is connected,

1188
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
everything is feasible,

1189
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
but are you ready to invest that money?

1190
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This is the situation.

1191
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
If you lose so much,

1192
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and if you invest so much,

1193
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
which is more than their loss,

1194
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
it's a redundant task,

1195
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
the management must decide

1196
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
whether it's a problem

1197
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and how we are ready to invest.

1198
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Is this the problem we have with Andraž?

1199
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Normal people look at the work-life balance

1200
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
more than JavaScript handlers.

1201
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
No.

1202
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I had a similar example today.

1203
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You go to Slack,

1204
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
a developer,

1205
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
a solid developer,

1206
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
and the charts are off,

1207
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
panic, panic.

1208
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I don't know if I've seen

1209
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
so many shits,

1210
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
but you're alive.

1211
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,800
You know, let's say you have a coffee and then you die

1212
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,800
because we are in this ultra panic mode

1213
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,000
you don't think clearly, adrenaline is infused

1214
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,400
you don't know if there is a problem or not

1215
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,400
you saw the exception, we have the whole fox, that's why we have monitoring and logging

1216
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,000
you die first

1217
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
first question, if you don't know what it is, is it necessary?

1218
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I don't know, is it necessary to risk your whole life?

1219
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
die and then pay taxes

1220
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
die and then pay taxes, is it necessary?

1221
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
it's not just that panic, fear, you get stuck

1222
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and then you don't think clearly

1223
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
and then people, if they weren't conscious at the time

1224
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
they do something stupid

1225
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
they go and, I don't know, they make something up

1226
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
or they go and, I don't know, they scale something

1227
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
or they reboot, it's a classic

1228
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
or they reboot and then they die in the logging

1229
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
and then what?

1230
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
it can come because of that, especially if you have a flat structure

1231
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
quickly before that, the party called the boss

1232
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
don't work, panic

1233
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
you can't say that, it's very important to see the situation

1234
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
to talk to your colleagues

1235
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
make a smart conversation

1236
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
maybe in the logging you just need to call the party back

1237
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and say, we'll fix it, we know what's going on

1238
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and I see that people always react

1239
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I have a slightly different view of it

1240
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
unfortunately we got involved with alpinism

1241
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and some extreme sports

1242
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and you have to control your stress level

1243
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
otherwise you'll always die because of it

1244
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
if you work in an industry where survival is important

1245
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and it happens to you, you've already died somewhere before

1246
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
an even bigger obstacle in these incidents

1247
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
are the demands

1248
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
if you don't talk about how it came to this incident

1249
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
do we have a safety net?

1250
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
do we have a safety net to overcome these problems in the future

1251
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
with some human factors

1252
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
or with a machine-programmed approach to whatever

1253
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
maybe this exception happened because

1254
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
integration tests that could test the whole product of the case

1255
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
didn't cover it and we opened it up again

1256
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
maybe we have a staging environment

1257
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
maybe we have the latest version of the system

1258
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
my point is to keep calm

1259
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
you don't have to communicate

1260
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and then do it, I can see that

1261
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
but you as a developer

1262
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
whatever, I'm a woman

1263
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
team management, I mean developing a team

1264
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:43,000
how did you feel about on-call or manual requests

1265
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I don't know if it was some kind of code deploy

1266
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
that happened in some strange hours

1267
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I was in a position with Andraž

1268
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
or his company and Marjano

1269
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,000
and Marjano asked for an on-call

1270
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and all the talks that Andraž had

1271
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
we already had at that level

1272
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
and the developer goes and asks for an on-call

1273
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
to tell what is expected

1274
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
apart from the on-call, it's also easier

1275
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
we know that there are holidays

1276
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
we just want to see if there are any problems

1277
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
because we will sell something or whatever

1278
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
what can you do, these are some possible failures

1279
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
if it happens, we will do this

1280
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and then it all has to be documented

1281
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
simulation also helps

1282
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
one of the interesting problems is Cassandra

1283
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and their addition of disks

1284
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
or if you have a tombstone or whatever

1285
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
it's a thing that you can predict

1286
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
if you have a lot of traffic, someone will be able to do it

1287
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and then there are engineers that will prepare the on-call

1288
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and if it happens, we will do this

1289
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and then on the same day, the person was paid

1290
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
to look at it

1291
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
this is my sub-question

1292
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
how many handbooks did you work with

1293
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
when you were working on Disaster Recovery Drill?

1294
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
NDA!

1295
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Drill, yes!

1296
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I know that...

1297
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm not saying that the documentation that she mentioned exists

1298
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
but it was like, look, today we will delete

1299
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
an availability zone on AWS

1300
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
which is our application

1301
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
or a datacenter goes down

1302
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
or we will delete a link, a database will come up

1303
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and it's like, the whole team knows what's going on

1304
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
or they don't know

1305
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and you don't tell them

1306
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
it's typical for VEA

1307
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
that's why they have to know the board

1308
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
we are not that extreme

1309
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I have a company where we practice

1310
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
some monitoring Thursdays

1311
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and every Thursday we make money

1312
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and randomly we get together

1313
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and one hour on Thursday

1314
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
we do some observability

1315
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
slash monitoring

1316
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
where we say, this is an exception

1317
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and randomly we pick a stack trace

1318
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
we don't look for what is an error

1319
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
or what is an exception

1320
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
but where did it happen

1321
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
did it restart the pod

1322
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
did it run out of memory

1323
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
we try to determine

1324
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
how we will see when the next exception happens

1325
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and we practice that

1326
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and then we make an analysis

1327
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
for example, for that particular service

1328
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
we know that it scales up and down

1329
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
we know that it's healthy

1330
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
and we don't know how it restarted

1331
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Was it a random exception?

1332
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
No, let's try it

1333
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It was a random exception

1334
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
because the systems fail at random

1335
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
and at the end

1336
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
of that hour

1337
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
there is a timebox

1338
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and we go, ok

1339
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
in the center of the log I don't see

1340
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
a URL or a path to the service

1341
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
where it happened

1342
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and then a ticket is written on the back

1343
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and then it is corrected

1344
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and then in the back you can see

1345
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
who is responsible for that

1346
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
and this is what we call full over

1347
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
because we poke all over the place

1348
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
and we get a pattern

1349
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Also, the combination

1350
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
of mixing team members

1351
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
shows where you have silos

1352
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
For example, you have a lot of knowledge

1353
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
in some systems

1354
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and you forget to write it

1355
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's good knowledge sharing

1356
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Especially when you don't have

1357
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
documented things

1358
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
For example, I had a cluster in Asia

1359
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
and I forgot to write where it is

1360
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and then you force people

1361
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
to figure out

1362
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
what would happen

1363
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
if there was a problem

1364
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
and you improve the infrastructure

1365
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I see that it works well

1366
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and it's a good exercise

1367
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's a good exercise

1368
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and you don't have to deal

1369
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
with specific exceptions

1370
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I had a handbook

1371
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Disaster recovery

1372
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
means

1373
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
data center switch

1374
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
They had data centers

1375
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
they had their own equipment

1376
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Service

1377
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
means people who weren't their own

1378
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
that they had disks

1379
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
because of compliance

1380
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
They had two data centers in the same place

1381
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
If it was in the cloud

1382
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
it would mean two regions

1383
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It's more old school

1384
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
There was a center switch

1385
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
One of my commitments was

1386
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
specific legacy services

1387
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
that were feature complete

1388
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
which is weird

1389
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
They didn't have years of development

1390
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
They had to modify

1391
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and change

1392
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Everyone knew the month

1393
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
because they had to change

1394
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
the software

1395
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
so they supported it

1396
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and practiced

1397
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It was like that

1398
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
with time

1399
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
You have a company

1400
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
that is 40 years old

1401
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and it's still going

1402
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It's a big

1403
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It was a switch

1404
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
but there were expectations

1405
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
from the engineering hierarchy

1406
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You haven't switched the service

1407
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
for 6 months

1408
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and it happened

1409
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
If you have real-time things

1410
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
traditional financial industries

1411
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It was an event

1412
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Everyone knew

1413
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
SVP and VPA

1414
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's a company of 2000 engineers

1415
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I worked with them

1416
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I had it

1417
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It's a small probability

1418
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
that you'll have it

1419
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I had it with bigger companies

1420
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
in Switzerland

1421
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
In Slovenia I saw it only on paper

1422
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
With the same teams

1423
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
that I worked in Slovenia

1424
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I managed to prepare

1425
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
for the documentation

1426
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
They never let me

1427
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
turn off a button

1428
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It's interesting

1429
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's interesting

1430
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
that people

1431
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It's better

1432
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
to deal with fear

1433
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It's better to

1434
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
warn the church

1435
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It sounds like an extreme sport

1436
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
but to turn off a button

1437
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
shouldn't be extreme

1438
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
But you said

1439
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
everything is possible

1440
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
The most classic legacy

1441
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
is a problem

1442
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
If you go in that era

1443
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
before any cloud

1444
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
All those problems

1445
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
that you turned off

1446
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
was a big risk

1447
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
If you physically

1448
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
don't turn it off

1449
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
it won't work

1450
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
If it would start

1451
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
from the start

1452
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
you would have

1453
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
6 months of tests

1454
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
to prepare

1455
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
If you have an infrastructure

1456
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
that is not up-to-date

1457
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I don't trust you

1458
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
If you need to reboot

1459
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
or turn it off

1460
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
that's the problem

1461
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's true that today

1462
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
with cloud

1463
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
or any other infrastructure

1464
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
that is constantly lying

1465
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
They are hiding you

1466
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
You have other problems

1467
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
that you can solve

1468
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But I have a feeling

1469
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
that certain things are hidden

1470
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's a lie

1471
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
If you are an engineer

1472
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
that is skilled

1473
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
you can work on a deterministic

1474
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You don't have to

1475
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
change everything

1476
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
You don't have to

1477
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
change everything

1478
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'm talking from a perspective

1479
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
If you are deploying

1480
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
to a configuration

1481
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
and the interface is turned off

1482
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and you can only get in the car

1483
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Do you know people like that?

1484
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
We learned a lot

1485
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
They are the second generation

1486
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Everything is from the second generation

1487
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It's different

1488
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
When we talk about technical topics

1489
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
it's always latest greatest

1490
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Everything that existed 2 years ago

1491
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
didn't exist

1492
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's good for the greenfield deployment

1493
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
When you put something new

1494
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
The problem is that

1495
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
90% is about legacy

1496
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Something is already there

1497
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You can integrate it

1498
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You can upgrade it

1499
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It's understandable

1500
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
that the systems are set

1501
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Hey, I just realized

1502
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
that I have a bottle on my nose

1503
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Did you notice that too?

1504
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I have an empty one

1505
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I drink it all

1506
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
My whiskey was the cleanest

1507
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
It wasn't whiskey

1508
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I wanted to interrupt you

1509
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
because we have a lot of interesting topics

1510
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Let's move to the last part

1511
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's like when you get 2 grams of X-ops

1512
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It's not therapy

1513
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Let's move to something more positive

1514
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm interested

1515
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Wait, what do I have here

1516
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Suppliers, Wi-Fi, security

1517
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
IPv6 is boring

1518
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
WPC is boring

1519
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Flutter

1520
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Let's talk about it

1521
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
You know what I feel like

1522
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It's the end of the year

1523
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
so this episode will probably be in December

1524
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
In Groovy we're trying

1525
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
to create a community

1526
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
because later

1527
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
we give out the fake information

1528
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
and we want to give it to people

1529
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
not just to give it to us

1530
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I want to ask you

1531
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
where have you been this year

1532
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
at some meetups

1533
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
What have you done for the community

1534
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Let's talk about it

1535
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
What have we done for the community

1536
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
We always talk about the community

1537
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I forgot where you were

1538
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I wrote that I have to ask

1539
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
How many meetups were there this year

1540
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and how many BSides

1541
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I don't know how many

1542
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
This year was a lot

1543
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
What are meetups and BSides

1544
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
What are meetups

1545
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Let's go back to the episode

1546
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The idea is that

1547
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
there are meetups

1548
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
where people who like it

1549
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
or are interested in IT

1550
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
cyber security

1551
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
cyber

1552
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
hash tag

1553
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
let's say

1554
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
who likes to hack

1555
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
meet up

1556
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
talk

1557
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
hear something new

1558
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
exchange experiences

1559
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
maybe

1560
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
make a capture the flag

1561
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
and that's it

1562
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
it's a crazy idea

1563
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Do you need a black hoodie

1564
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
No

1565
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Do you need to have a laptop

1566
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
We had a situation

1567
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
where people

1568
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
asked for a laptop

1569
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
and they were successful

1570
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Are challenges part of it

1571
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Is it a foreign activity

1572
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
or are they always there

1573
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Let's say

1574
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It's a franchise

1575
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It started in Australia

1576
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Is it Sektor or BSides

1577
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Sektor

1578
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Pedram started

1579
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
There are more communities

1580
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I don't know

1581
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Almost everyone has their own

1582
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
There are a few in the world

1583
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
or in Europe

1584
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It's not necessary

1585
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
to have a capture the flag

1586
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
It turned out

1587
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
that it's a loose

1588
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I won't say germification

1589
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
but it's not just

1590
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
a show

1591
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You need to have

1592
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
small interactions

1593
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
small competitions

1594
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
There are many ways

1595
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
to skin a cat

1596
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
There is not only one solution

1597
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
How do you solve a problem

1598
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It's great to see

1599
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and exchange experiences

1600
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
When you learn something new

1601
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
it's also a challenge

1602
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
to prepare for it

1603
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It means that

1604
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
you have a goal

1605
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and the concept is that

1606
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
the winner has the privilege

1607
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
to prepare the challenge

1608
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It's a privilege

1609
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It's a challenge

1610
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
It turns out that

1611
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
it's a challenge

1612
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
that people don't have the knowledge

1613
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
or the time

1614
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Sometimes it happens

1615
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
that there is no CTF

1616
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
or they use a CTF

1617
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
from another competition

1618
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It depends

1619
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
We also had a few sects

1620
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
in the summer

1621
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
when we were only drinking

1622
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Did you have any students

1623
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
in the first year

1624
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Yes

1625
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
We had someone

1626
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
who gave a talk

1627
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
about his android

1628
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It was great

1629
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
because he didn't know

1630
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
what he was doing

1631
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
What about B-Sides

1632
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It's something new

1633
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
The concept of B-Sides

1634
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
is the easiest

1635
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
to imagine

1636
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
B-Sides are big events

1637
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
or big conferences

1638
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
that are usually

1639
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
commercial

1640
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
These are conferences

1641
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
that are supported

1642
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
by big vendors

1643
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
and there is a lot of money

1644
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's a C-level cadre

1645
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
The more technical part

1646
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
is that

1647
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
around these big events

1648
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
there are B-Sides

1649
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
where the community

1650
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
supports each other

1651
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
The idea of B-Sides

1652
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
is that it's community driven

1653
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It's besides the bigger event

1654
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
One of the references

1655
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
is that there were cassettes

1656
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
and the cassettes were

1657
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
magnetic tapes

1658
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
We understand that

1659
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
There were magnetic tapes

1660
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
in a plastic packaging

1661
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
and the tapes were A-Side and B-Side

1662
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
You could turn the cassette

1663
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
There were big hits on A-Side

1664
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
and the rest were on B-Side

1665
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And in Ljubljana

1666
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
there are no A-Sides, only B-Sides

1667
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Yes, and here in Ljubljana

1668
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
when I was traveling

1669
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I thought that

1670
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
we need this in Slovenia

1671
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
so we made B-Sides

1672
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
There was an A-Side event

1673
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and a bigger B-Side

1674
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
and we realized that

1675
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
we don't need A-Side events

1676
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I wanted to ask

1677
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
if Slovenian security will come

1678
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
The agency told you that they came to you, but you didn't tell them.

1679
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I think we haven't followed that yet.

1680
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I wouldn't have told that either.

1681
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I don't know, I think we haven't...

1682
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I've been to events where they were

1683
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
undercover security services,

1684
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
so all of that is happening in Tuin.

1685
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But no, not for us.

1686
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Not with the intention of attracting

1687
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
security experts.

1688
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That's the big deal in Slovenia.

1689
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
The biggest problem is that I don't know

1690
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
if they have anything to offer.

1691
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Yes, if they do...

1692
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
They can give you a very good challenge,

1693
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
if they know how to compensate you.

1694
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
If they know how to compensate you.

1695
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
If they know how to compensate you.

1696
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
What do you think?

1697
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Is that a challenge?

1698
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
No.

1699
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
OK, OK.

1700
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
You do that in Grodno, right?

1701
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yes.

1702
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
When they put you in those cryptos,

1703
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
then you can't keep it.

1704
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Can we say that if people are interested

1705
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
in security, real security,

1706
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
come to Sektoke, come to B-Sites.

1707
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yes.

1708
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Friends and family.

1709
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That's definitely a type of event

1710
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
where you will have a lot of hands-on

1711
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
people who are more technically

1712
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
equipped in some hands-on areas

1713
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
that are connected to that.

1714
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
that are connected to that.

1715
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
that are connected to that.

1716
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But we don't have any more questions

1717
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
about that.

1718
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
We don't.

1719
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
You sold this year on two or three

1720
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
tracks.

1721
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Last time you sold on AWS Meetup,

1722
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
on Ruby Meetup,

1723
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
on DevOpsDays Ljubljana.

1724
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
on DevOpsDays Ljubljana.

1725
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
On DevOpsDays Ljubljana.

1726
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Every year I sell on NTFL.

1727
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Every year I sell on NTFL.

1728
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
But this year I have too few students

1729
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
on that select item.

1730
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
What did you sell?

1731
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Maybe you can change the item.

1732
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Do you have the same?

1733
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
No.

1734
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
On AWS Meetup,

1735
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
on Ruby Meetup,

1736
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
on DevOpsDays,

1737
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
it was almost the same.

1738
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It was evolving.

1739
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
It was evolving.

1740
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Last year I sold...

1741
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
This year I could sell on NTFL.

1742
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
This year I could sell on NTFL.

1743
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
on NTFL.

1744
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
on NTFL.

1745
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
on NTFL.

1746
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
on NTFL.

1747
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
on NTFL.

1748
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
on NTFL.

1749
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And then...

1750
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I have 10 of these.

1751
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I have 10 of these.

1752
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I have 10 of these.

1753
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I have 10 of these.

1754
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I only focus on 3.

1755
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I only focus on 3.

1756
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
One of them is SQL injection.

1757
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
One of them is SQL injection.

1758
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And then still 10?

1759
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And then still 10?

1760
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
No, back.

1761
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
No, back.

1762
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I know it came back a bit.

1763
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I know it came back a bit.

1764
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Yeah, back.

1765
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I don't know how Slovenian news is this year.

1766
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I don't know how Slovenian news is this year.

1767
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I don't know how Slovenian news is this year.

1768
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But we had a whole bunch.

1769
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
What I do next is

1770
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
full impactful for them.

1771
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I have those memes.

1772
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I don't know if you remember.

1773
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I have those memes.

1774
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I have those memes.

1775
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And I also make them

1776
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
fully plastic.

1777
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
So it's very simple.

1778
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So it's very simple.

1779
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And in this show

1780
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And in this show

1781
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I make it a bit practical for them.

1782
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I make it a bit practical for them.

1783
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And this organization

1784
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
has this document.

1785
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I forgot the name.

1786
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I forgot the name.

1787
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
It's a website document.

1788
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It's a website document.

1789
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's not for full control

1790
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It's not for full control

1791
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
of different standards.

1792
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It's not for full control of different standards.

1793
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
For example,

1794
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Soc2.

1795
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And I'll tell them

1796
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
if you can do anything with the app

1797
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
and I'll mention it.

1798
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And I'll tell them.

1799
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And I'll tell them.

1800
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And I'll tell them.

1801
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And I'll tell them.

1802
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And this is full of memes

1803
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And this is full of memes

1804
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
and plastic ads.

1805
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Because in one hour

1806
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I have a spark of students

1807
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
who see it's interesting

1808
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and remember it.

1809
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And remember it.

1810
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And then

1811
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I try to connect them

1812
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I try to connect them

1813
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
to Slovenian developer community

1814
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
to Slovenian developer community

1815
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
to wider events.

1816
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So I got this opportunity.

1817
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So I got this opportunity.

1818
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I'm an industry representative

1819
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
so I have a little bit of it.

1820
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
So yeah,

1821
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
this is something

1822
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I'm really glad about.

1823
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Lani was really amazing.

1824
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Lani was really amazing.

1825
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Students were really happy.

1826
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Who did you mentor next?

1827
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I mentor people

1828
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
who are not officially

1829
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I mentor people who are not officially

1830
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
You mentor them but they don't know

1831
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
that you mentor them.

1832
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
No, no, no.

1833
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I think that from Andras' perspective

1834
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I think that from Andras' perspective

1835
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
he's very susceptible to mentor the whole thing.

1836
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
he's very susceptible to mentor the whole thing.

1837
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
He has a big threshold

1838
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
when he mentors someone by himself.

1839
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
He has a big threshold when he mentors someone by himself.

1840
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
There are two things.

1841
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
One is coaching, which is a commercial thing.

1842
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
One is coaching, which is a commercial thing.

1843
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Because for example,

1844
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
we have a junior mentor

1845
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
we have a junior mentor

1846
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
but we don't have anyone we can share

1847
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
but we don't have anyone we can share

1848
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
the job with.

1849
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And then I say,

1850
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
hey, I can offer you this package

1851
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
and general things

1852
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
because if someone is really fresh

1853
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I can give him some knowledge that is not specific to the field.

1854
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
And if I can teach this person

1855
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And if I can teach this person

1856
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
or

1857
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
onboard him from the general things

1858
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
so that you can specialize him on the things

1859
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
so that you can specialize him on the things

1860
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
you need.

1861
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
For example,

1862
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
for Slovenia, it's one thing.

1863
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It's a commercial offer.

1864
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I call it coaching.

1865
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I do it a little bit because I don't believe

1866
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
that you can coach full-time.

1867
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
There are some weird things.

1868
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
The other thing is mentoring.

1869
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
There is very little coaching.

1870
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Mentoring is like

1871
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
mentoring is like

1872
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
where I prepare them

1873
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
and put them in

1874
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
and then I try to help them.

1875
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and then I try to help them.

1876
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It doesn't mean that I teach them how to program.

1877
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
It doesn't mean that I teach them how to program.

1878
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I try to direct them

1879
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
differently.

1880
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
If they have doubts

1881
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
or questions that are not

1882
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
in the getting started

1883
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
page

1884
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
or in the Slovenian space

1885
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I help them better.

1886
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Often

1887
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
the stories of people

1888
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
who come to me

1889
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
are quite fascinating.

1890
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
are quite fascinating.

1891
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
These people

1892
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
are quite easy to take

1893
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
under their wings.

1894
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I only get

1895
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
a few times.

1896
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
As much as I need help

1897
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I gladly help.

1898
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
If someone I'm not sure about

1899
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
If someone I'm not sure about

1900
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I will mentor them.

1901
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
For example, in Ljubljana

1902
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I have a Ljubljana city test.

1903
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I have a Ljubljana city test.

1904
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I go on Saturday and get a Ljubljana city test on Friday.

1905
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I go on Saturday and get a Ljubljana city test on Friday.

1906
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
It is a bit of a thrash.

1907
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It's hard for me to stay up

1908
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's hard for me to stay up

1909
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
but it's a good feeling.

1910
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
but it's a good feeling.

1911
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It's a good feeling.

1912
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
You can see

1913
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
how well someone prepared.

1914
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
This creativity.

1915
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
This creativity.

1916
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
If I had to give you an over value

1917
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
If I had to give you an over value

1918
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I wouldn't make it in time.

1919
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I wouldn't make it in time.

1920
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
On Saturday at 6 a.m.

1921
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I don't care.

1922
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I don't care.

1923
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Most of the people

1924
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Most of the people

1925
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
would change their careers.

1926
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
would change their careers.

1927
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
would change their careers.

1928
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
would change their careers.

1929
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Most of the people are working tomorrow.

1930
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Most of the people are working tomorrow.

1931
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Most of the people are working tomorrow.

1932
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
It's funny when people ask me

1933
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It's funny when people ask me

1934
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
how do you find new handcuffs.

1935
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
It's good.

1936
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
My mentors are distributed

1937
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
in the industry.

1938
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
If they have a problem

1939
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
If they have a problem

1940
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I know how to fix it.

1941
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
People are grateful

1942
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
People are grateful

1943
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
if you help them.

1944
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
It's about small things.

1945
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
It's about small things.

1946
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
People think

1947
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
They think

1948
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I tell people

1949
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
where to buy books

1950
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It's not about that.

1951
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
It's about

1952
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It's about

1953
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
listening to people

1954
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
listening to people

1955
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's about

1956
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
learning about programming

1957
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
learning about programming

1958
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
if it's not your hobby

1959
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
you do whatever you want

1960
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
If you want to change

1961
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
If you want to change

1962
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Then you have to focus

1963
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Then you have to focus

1964
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Then you have to focus

1965
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
on your career

1966
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Then you have to

1967
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
take part in conversations

1968
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
take part in conversations

1969
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
and then I can help

1970
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
if there is an option

1971
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
If there are open spaces

1972
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
that are fit for them

1973
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I always do it

1974
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
so I don't get those commissions

1975
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
because it's another trap

1976
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
when people think they are innovators

1977
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
just because you get

1978
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
hiring fee

1979
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
and then people don't understand

1980
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
ok, ok

1981
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
let's extend the question

1982
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
let's extend the question

1983
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
shoot, shoot

1984
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
no, no, my next question

1985
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
was when people say

1986
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Andraj Zrihti is our developer

1987
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
do you know any student?

1988
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
we've already discussed

1989
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
we've already discussed

1990
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
we've already talked about it

1991
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
it's not that big

1992
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
it's not that big

1993
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I still get it

1994
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I still get it

1995
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'm sure you know

1996
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
who we need a student

1997
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
not in front of us

1998
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
not in front of us

1999
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
you have to know

2000
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
you have to be an expert

2001
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
not in front of us

2002
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
it's simple

2003
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I have people I can talk to

2004
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
and I send them

2005
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
but I'm looking for that fit

2006
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
because it's not my thing

2007
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I'm not into that

2008
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
someone is looking for a fit

2009
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
to have a good experience

2010
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and that person

2011
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
that I send

2012
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
or that I know

2013
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
is looking for a job

2014
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
to have a good experience

2015
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and then I try to match that

2016
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and then a lot of times

2017
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
there are inquiries

2018
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
that I don't have to match

2019
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
what do you mean by success rate?

2020
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
what's that?

2021
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I don't know, I'm not tracking

2022
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
because there's no API

2023
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
but yes

2024
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
most people you find

2025
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
look, from those people

2026
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
that have helped me

2027
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
in the last 3 years

2028
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
let's say there were about 12

2029
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
because they have 4

2030
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
that I know

2031
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
two have changed their careers

2032
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I can't list people

2033
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
that have changed

2034
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
but they are building

2035
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
in software development

2036
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
and then

2037
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I just saw on LinkedIn

2038
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
that they got a job

2039
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I'm not that

2040
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
busy

2041
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I have kids

2042
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
but I see

2043
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
that

2044
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I don't draw it

2045
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I have to see

2046
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
with those people

2047
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
if you are

2048
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
matching the job

2049
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
then you are helping

2050
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I think I'm doing

2051
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
a good job

2052
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I'm helping

2053
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
out of those 12

2054
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
there are 6

2055
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
what's wrong with that?

2056
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
that would be weird

2057
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
but I have everything

2058
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
nobody came to me

2059
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
and said

2060
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
those jobs are crap

2061
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
even if you thought

2062
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I don't care

2063
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
why are you doing this?

2064
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
it's very simple

2065
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
they don't have kids

2066
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
no, not at all

2067
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
ok, ok

2068
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
they don't have kids

2069
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
you have kids

2070
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
and we heard that you are

2071
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
flirting with sektoks

2072
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
and b-sides

2073
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
why are you doing this?

2074
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I don't know how many years

2075
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
15 years ago in CyberPip

2076
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
it's cool

2077
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
no, I mean

2078
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
why?

2079
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
it's just

2080
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
my passion

2081
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
it's fun

2082
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
it's fun to flirt

2083
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I mean

2084
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
yes, in a way

2085
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
you know

2086
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
when those things grow up

2087
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
and become a job

2088
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
then it's fun

2089
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
until we start

2090
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
having fun

2091
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
it's cool

2092
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I think the most important

2093
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
understanding is that it's not

2094
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
just a game

2095
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
if you help people

2096
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
the industry has a lot of potential

2097
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
to grow

2098
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
we can raise the level

2099
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
so that we won't

2100
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
be just a

2101
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
agency

2102
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
but we can

2103
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
raise the level

2104
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and start a business

2105
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
for me

2106
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
when I was 18

2107
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
15 years ago

2108
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I joined CyberPip

2109
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and I learned a lot

2110
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
there

2111
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
it's not like they taught me in Stalin

2112
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
it was just a community

2113
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
that helped me a lot

2114
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and now I have the privilege

2115
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
that

2116
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I have enough time

2117
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
and health

2118
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
and I'm not very demanding

2119
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
so I have a lot of energy

2120
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
and I can give it back to the community

2121
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
and I think that's the most fair

2122
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
you can give back a lot of resources

2123
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
yes, just a lot

2124
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
whatever those resources are

2125
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
yes, exactly

2126
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
that's a good thing

2127
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
you can give it back

2128
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
because why

2129
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
it's nice to organize events

2130
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
when you see that people

2131
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
like it

2132
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
it's nice to make content

2133
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
it's nice to help people

2134
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
for me it's

2135
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
the only fair thing

2136
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
for me

2137
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
is to give back to the community

2138
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
sometimes it was with a lot of time

2139
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
now with some time

2140
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
you get some money

2141
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
and you reinvest it in the community

2142
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
if it wasn't for you

2143
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
the previous generation

2144
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
not in years, but in history

2145
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
how we progressed

2146
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
through the community

2147
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
it would be a lot harder

2148
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I would do something else

2149
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
it would be boring

2150
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
yes, I would do something else

2151
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I ask myself

2152
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I learned a lot

2153
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
how to give back

2154
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
for me it's natural

2155
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
and I look at the same faces

2156
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
every year

2157
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
and it's new

2158
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
let's warm up

2159
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Oto a bit

2160
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Oto, why are you doing this?

2161
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
let's start

2162
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
you were also

2163
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
quite active this year

2164
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
the mission

2165
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
service, three children

2166
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
garden

2167
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
and healthy

2168
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
let's give a little more

2169
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
and brush your teeth

2170
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and

2171
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
why did you turn me away?

2172
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
you started

2173
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
double Andrasin

2174
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
double Andrasin

2175
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
with the current

2176
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
schedule

2177
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I have

2178
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I do pure development

2179
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
and hardcore development

2180
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and I don't have

2181
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
management

2182
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I don't have the team

2183
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
so I don't have

2184
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
to go to calls

2185
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I have some

2186
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
but more limited

2187
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
which means

2188
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I can do healthy

2189
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
things that are

2190
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
important to me

2191
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
like gardening

2192
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
so I have the capacity

2193
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
to do it

2194
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
it's not easy

2195
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
to do it healthy

2196
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
but when I think about it

2197
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
we will do it

2198
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
is it big?

2199
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
no, no

2200
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
no, no

2201
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
listen

2202
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
this is such

2203
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
an opportunity

2204
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
to do something extraordinary

2205
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
and such opportunities

2206
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I don't know how

2207
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I like it

2208
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Oto manager

2209
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
inspiring his team

2210
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
ok

2211
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
how many opportunities

2212
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
will you get in Slovenia

2213
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
3000-4000 developers

2214
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
engineers

2215
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
where did you get

2216
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
this mindset? you create

2217
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
opportunities

2218
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
we created

2219
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
an opportunity

2220
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
and I think it's extraordinary

2221
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
and I want to see

2222
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
how it grows

2223
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
it's exciting

2224
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
and it's fun

2225
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
my role changes

2226
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
and all together

2227
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
we have different

2228
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
views

2229
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
what is easy

2230
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
and what is not

2231
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
when you say

2232
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
we are healthy

2233
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
yes, but we delegate things

2234
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
and it happens

2235
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
anyway

2236
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
it seems important

2237
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
that if we have

2238
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
an opportunity

2239
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
to use it

2240
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
and give something back

2241
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
and I don't know

2242
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
if we will destroy ourselves

2243
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
with a nuclear weapon

2244
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
from Vesolja

2245
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
maybe YouTube will record

2246
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
on some disk

2247
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
then Vesolja will need

2248
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
this signal

2249
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I see this platform

2250
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
it's growing

2251
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
the feedback is great

2252
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I see that we experiment

2253
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
that we learn

2254
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
that people believe in us

2255
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
that they support us

2256
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I'm just interested

2257
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
what will happen next

2258
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
how will we grow

2259
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
what will we do next

2260
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
how will we get

2261
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
the next generation of developers

2262
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
all these things

2263
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
are exciting

2264
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
and

2265
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
as I've seen

2266
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
in different events

2267
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I've organized conferences

2268
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
meetups, whatever

2269
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
and

2270
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I see this as

2271
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
an upgrade of all

2272
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
these experiments

2273
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
on a larger scale

2274
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
more modern

2275
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
and

2276
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
evolutionary

2277
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
this is the next step

2278
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
this is important

2279
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
and

2280
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I want everything

2281
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
to work in such a way

2282
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
to be resilient

2283
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
as you said

2284
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
if I get sick, David will go

2285
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
to Val202

2286
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
or we will have this

2287
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
resiliency that everyone

2288
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
is responsible

2289
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
for the benefits that come

2290
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
from this

2291
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
this year

2292
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I gave a lecture

2293
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
in Portugal

2294
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I gave a lecture

2295
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
in Portugal

2296
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
what are you waiting for?

2297
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
is this it?

2298
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
well

2299
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
debate?

2300
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
no, no

2301
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
how did I find you?

2302
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
you know what's funny?

2303
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
when I'm in a position

2304
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
where I have to speak

2305
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I will directly ask questions

2306
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
we can have an episode

2307
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
but I won't now

2308
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
if technology is interesting

2309
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I was in a lecture

2310
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
on Portuguese women

2311
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I said hello

2312
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
we were together

2313
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
in Portuguese

2314
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I was close to

2315
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Dragonhack

2316
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I was there as a judge

2317
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I hope we will have another

2318
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Dragonhack lecture

2319
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
in December

2320
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
that was very interesting

2321
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I also gave

2322
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
some other things

2323
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I was at the Makeit conference

2324
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and at Openblend

2325
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
we also started some things

2326
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
this year

2327
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
in the last part

2328
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I gave a lecture

2329
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
for SkillUp mentor

2330
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
shoutout

2331
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
where I

2332
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
with the thought

2333
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
that I prepared this

2334
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
program for skillup developers

2335
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
for skillup developers

2336
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I was thinking

2337
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
what is a talk

2338
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
that I could do

2339
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
that he can't

2340
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
give

2341
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I have my own experience

2342
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
so I had a talk

2343
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
about

2344
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
technical interviews

2345
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
how you become

2346
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
how you become

2347
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
an engineer

2348
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
as a developer

2349
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
we focused

2350
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
on that aspect

2351
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
of technical interviews

2352
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
we did

2353
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
an event

2354
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
there were 50 developers

2355
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
we invited 2

2356
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
we had a mock interview

2357
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
we had

2358
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
5 questions

2359
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
after those 5 questions

2360
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
we did an analysis

2361
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and then

2362
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
first there was

2363
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
a coding question

2364
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
that was

2365
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
incomprehensible, illogical, complicated

2366
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
that had

2367
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
no solution

2368
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
so it was very

2369
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
complicated

2370
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
meaning that

2371
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
for example, you pick a candidate

2372
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and then you put it in a

2373
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
non-acceptable zone

2374
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
to see how he will react

2375
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
if he doesn't know the answer

2376
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
what he will look for, what he will turn to, how he will start to think,

2377
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
how he will look for help,

2378
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
will he ask for help, so you can see his mindset.

2379
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
We did that,

2380
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
and it was very well prepared.

2381
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
When we talked,

2382
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
a lot of these things I do now,

2383
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
because I have a little contact with what our audience is interested in,

2384
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
to get feedback,

2385
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
to understand if I am doing the right thing or not.

2386
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
So that's a great thing,

2387
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
that at these events,

2388
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
people come and say,

2389
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
hey, I listened to your theory,

2390
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
that's a really good feeling,

2391
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
when you see that you can help people,

2392
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
that's a really good feeling.

2393
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Especially when you see someone who is very shy,

2394
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
who tries to say what he is comfortable with.

2395
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
That's really amazing.

2396
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
We all understood that.

2397
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Maybe you can tell us about the sponsors?

2398
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
We are through the library.

2399
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
What do we have? Sponsors?

2400
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
We can thank Humanfrog,

2401
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
and 3FSO, because they are our supporters.

2402
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
We all have a little more space.

2403
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
We can also thank Patreon,

2404
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
who supports us through the Patreon platform.

2405
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
If an episode is prepared,

2406
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
we put it on Patreon,

2407
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
and if it is pre-released,

2408
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
and it is a premium feature,

2409
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
you can support us through Patreon,

2410
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
and enable us to produce these products.

2411
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
That's it.

2412
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
You know what else we can do?

2413
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
We can have a Discord,

2414
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
and I will send you the link.

2415
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
When it snows,

2416
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
when it snows,

2417
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
and when it snows,

2418
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
it will be easier.

2419
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Will it snow this year?

2420
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
We will film it this year,

2421
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
because we can't do it in November.

2422
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Thank you for your attention.

2423
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Thank you both for this short interview.

2424
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Thank you, Andraž.

2425
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Thank you, good luck.

2426
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Bye.
