00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to a brand new episode of Ogrodje.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This time with a beautiful picture,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with beautiful guests,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with a beautiful sound,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in a pleasant ambience,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and with a new Elan,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with a new energy that we tried to choose

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
for this episode.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, welcome to the new episode of Ogrodje.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This time with a beautiful picture,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with beautiful guests,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
with a new energy that we tried to choose

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
for this episode.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In our Ogrodje we have now shot

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I think about 22-23 episodes.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
These are episodes that are somewhat

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
suitable especially for experienced experts,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
for people who work in our industry,

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
people who do not work in our industry.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And among all these stories,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we listen to a lot of the audience,

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we listen to our listeners and viewers.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And we started to ask ourselves

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
how we could make Ogrodje

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
even more accessible to the next generation

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
of developers,

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
beginners, juniors,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and people who try to enter this industry,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
because they have already seen that it is interesting

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
intellectually and because it is also

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
very attractive.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And because we somehow tried in Ogrodje

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to realize that it makes no sense

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to simplify our debates with great experts

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
too much to bring certain people

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
closer to the beginners,

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we decided to make a new series

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
of episodes that would be

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
very beginner-friendly.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This series of episodes will be called

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Zagon and you will find them

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in podcast platforms and also on YouTube.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They will be marked by themselves

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and are thoughts for beginners

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and also for those who would like

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to become beginners.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not to mention that we have

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
some experts who

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
talk about these things

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
in a very disconnected way.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We decided to invite them

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
as hosts of Zagon

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Sara Vashini-Gašper.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hi!

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She joined us in one of the previous episodes

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
where we talked about talent.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It was a very well-prepared episode.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She also joined us as a co-host

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
in one of the episodes.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And now we will see how Sara

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
treats us.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't have any notes today

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but we agreed on that.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I still don't understand

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
why I'm stealing this podcast for today.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But on the other hand,

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I know he will be happy to talk

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and not ask questions.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Greetings from my side.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
For those who don't know yet,

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm a tech recruiter

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
at the Slovenian and international markets.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm here today to protect the debate

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
on a fairly low level

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and to provide all the information

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that IT people need.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Not only those who want to program

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
but also those who would like

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to decode some concepts.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I managed to invite Petar Kešet

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in this episode.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I will start with my left.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Petar Kešet is a master engineer

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and programmer.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He hacked supercomputers

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
in Australia in the 90s.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He is the leader of the Slovenian

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
national IT team at the Olympics

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
for 5 years.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He has been working at the Jožef Štefan Institute

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
for a long time.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He has a lot to do with video.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You know a lot about video.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You probably know everything

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that can be done with video.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, I haven't done a lot of things yet.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There is still a lot to do.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Petar is currently employed

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
as a lead data scientist

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
at the Http pool.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
On my right is Dr. Mateu Špesek.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Those who go to FRI know him.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Those who don't know him

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
know him now.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He is a doctor and a lecturer at FRI.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He has his own laboratory

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
for computer graphics and multimedia.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I am a member of this laboratory.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You study and research

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
graphics and multimedia.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Your main focus is audio, music,

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
transcription, speech.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We have always been interested in audio.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We have dealt a lot with different types of audio.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
From human singing to piano transcription

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to data collection

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
from data

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
that is not studied

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
or recorded on such microphones.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
In the 70s, when older guests

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
gather and sing human songs,

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you can hear trumpets,

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
maybe a train or something else.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Especially what they do,

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
when they sing,

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
what type of singing it is.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
These things connect us

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
with non-computer areas.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Today, I thought

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that we will go a bit historical

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and a bit current.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Nothing difficult.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We will try to explain

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
to the audience

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
what it means to be a programmer,

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
what is a day-to-day job in this industry,

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
what are the different profiles,

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
because I see that there is a lot of misunderstanding

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
about where to start.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If we start at the beginning

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
with some definitions,

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
if we first clarify

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
who is an IT person,

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
who is a programmer,

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
who is an engineer,

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
what are the differences between them.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You will start, Petar.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I would say that all these people

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
have something in common,

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
all these profiles.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is a kind of

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
computational-analytical thinking.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It can be very synthetic.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
An IT person is anyone

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
in the computational industry.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Programmers, I think,

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
should not be the first to explain

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
how they are represented in movies,

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
how a code is rolled,

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
etc.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What is an engineer?

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What is the difference

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
between a programmer,

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
a developer, an engineer?

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are they all the same?

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I have always seen it this way.

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The difference between a developer and an engineer

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
is the definition I will use.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A developer is someone who uses

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
libraries, libraries that are already written,

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and an engineer is someone

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
who works on those things

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and goes deeper into it,

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
who has a deeper knowledge

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
of the computer itself,

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
if he knows it,

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and creates it.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can also say that

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
there are some differences.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
An engineer is someone who uses

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
the libraries he receives

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and creates something out of them.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He doesn't have a deep knowledge.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think there is a similar analogy

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
with music.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You know how to play an instrument,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you know how to take notes,

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and you can also write music.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
An engineer is someone

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you can trust to find a solution

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to your problem,

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
even if you don't know

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
how to solve it.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But on the basis of all the previous

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
experiences and deep knowledge,

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you somehow come up with a solution

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that is satisfactory.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I see that there is a result

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that I could use,

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
but more in the context of

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
being able to come up with a solution

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that is relatively optimal in this context.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But what is the difference

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
between a senior developer

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and a senior engineer?

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We used to say that there is a difference

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
between an assistant and a student,

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that the assistant has already googled

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
everything that has been googled.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Maybe in this context.

211
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If we look at the polls on your group

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
on Facebook,

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
do we really know the difference

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
between a junior and a senior mid?

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
These are some signs that

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
they are not exactly the same.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For example, one of the reasons

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
is that they are on Google.

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If we compare them with other companies,

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
they are completely unrelated.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I think that you are nothing more than

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
an engineer.

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You don't care about the names,

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
titles and signs.

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I haven't gone so far as to say

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
that you are a full challenger,

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
but depending on the organization...

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If we are going to talk about

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the fact that it was for beginners,

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
now that we have laid out the concepts,

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
titles are important in a way

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
because when you go to a meeting

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and talk to other people,

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
these titles help you understand

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
where you are in the organization

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and what your role is.

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
For certain titles, you know where you are.

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If you are a senior product manager,

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you probably have a bigger role

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
than a junior product manager.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Again, it depends on the industry,

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
size and so on.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It depends on the context,

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the company itself,

245
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
how you fall into it.

246
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But let's take a step back.

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We are talking about people

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
who write code.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Engineers and developers

250
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
write code.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
On the other hand,

252
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
there are also IT people.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't like all IT people.

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Why?

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In recent years,

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
technology has eaten up companies

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and transformed them.

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Some companies know this,

260
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
others don't.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
They try to implement

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
some digital processes in the company.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
These are different people

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and you can't just say IT.

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A lot of people hide this.

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Even in large companies

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
that are not primarily technological oriented.

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It can be the same person

269
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
who tries to implement processes

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and digital transformation.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We've been talking about it a lot in the last two years.

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It can be relatively dead on paper

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
because we don't have enough staff.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What is changing?

275
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If we look back 20-30 years,

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
the problems are changing very quickly.

277
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can still study,

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
but you go to high school.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You are a supporter of IT equipment

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and you can also be a supporter

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
of IT software equipment.

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If you look at it from a different perspective,

283
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
yes, sometimes they hide,

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
but it seems to me

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that they hide quite often

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
because we are so old

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and we don't know much about digital writing.

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But someone who is starting today

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and is 15 years old

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
can focus either on IT equipment

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
or on digital writing.

292
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Or not.

293
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I would say that

294
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
my experience is different.

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We often say,

296
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
when you have a guest

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that you don't know much about.

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Digital writing is a part of the IT world.

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Over time,

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
you learn a little bit about everything.

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can specialize in something

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
or you can see better in something.

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It is also typical

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
when it comes to maintaining equipment.

305
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You need to know a lot about the software

306
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
because sometimes you need to download

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
some software to see

308
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
if it is working properly.

309
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
When do you decide?

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I would say

311
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
that it is best to try new things.

312
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Over time,

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
there is also a key moment.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You come into an environment

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
where you have to offer

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
a hardware challenge.

317
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You like it and you deal with it.

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I would not say

319
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
that it is better or worse than others.

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think that everything is fine.

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I am also a hardware engineer.

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I agree with that.

323
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
In this context,

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
it is not that you choose,

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but experience chooses you.

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There is a project

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
that is so specific that you can say

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
that you are a high-value expert

329
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and there are 5 of us in Slovenia.

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Then there is another project

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and you lost the previous knowledge

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and you have to change it.

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That is why it is so much better in something else.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Every project is so challenging.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think that is the frustration

336
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
that makes us engineers.

337
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You are born an engineer.

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You are always frustrated

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and you want to solve things.

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No one said that programming,

341
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
development of hardware,

342
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
development of hardware is a big gift.

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It is black magic.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We do not understand how it works.

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It is very complicated

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and we are very frustrated,

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and we do not want to experience it.

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It is very esoteric.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think that

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you will see that

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
when you are recruiting.

352
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
When you are looking for talent,

353
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
when you are looking for people

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
with whom you want to work,

355
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
how do you recognize

356
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
if persistence is something

357
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that can be achieved,

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
if you have to be highly motivated.

359
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Can you learn that?

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Can you learn to be persistent?

361
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Can you learn how to pick apples

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
when you go to eat together?

363
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Part of that is the environment.

364
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If you are in an environment

365
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
where you can pick apples,

366
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think that everything comes

367
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
from personal motivation.

368
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If you have knowledge,

369
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
no problem.

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If you have enough motivation,

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you will achieve it.

372
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Everything comes from personal motivation

373
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and that is a big challenge.

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Maybe you are born as an engineer

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and you have it implicitly in you

376
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that you want to overcome that frustration.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It is similar to going to the gym

378
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
or fitness.

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You decide that you will lose weight

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
because you have 50 kilos too much.

381
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That is why you need a lot of motivation

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and everything else comes with time.

383
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Is your metabolism like that or not?

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Those are things that affect you.

385
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There are some coefficients in that path.

386
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you have motivation,

387
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you can achieve anything.

388
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It is the same for all potential

389
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
future programmers and juniors.

390
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you have a problem,

391
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
if you use one week instead of one hour,

392
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
it becomes easier for you.

393
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Much better.

394
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Most of my generation doesn't program anymore.

395
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I was in the business

396
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and I am back now.

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I can program now.

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I feel rewarded with it.

399
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I really enjoy it.

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You mentioned how to recognize

401
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
who is what.

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You talk to a person about a problem

403
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and then you see how he deals with it.

404
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That is what it is about.

405
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Do you have a person in your class

406
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
who talks about problems

407
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or is it a special search

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
to find the answer to a complex question?

409
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I can ask you one more question.

410
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I hope we all agree.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It is about solving problems.

412
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Difficult problems.

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You will solve them difficultly.

414
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There is a lot of work involved.

415
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you ask questions?

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
There is a lot of trial and error.

417
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let's go back to music.

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
How do you start improvising in music?

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That is a typical problem.

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
There are people who graduated from an academy

421
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
who are great musicians

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and know how to create music.

423
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The qualitative leap in the field

424
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
of improvising is one thing

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that you have to try.

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
On the other hand,

427
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
everything you have done

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
in the past

429
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
always takes away the influence

430
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
of previous musicians.

431
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You have already learned a lot

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and now you are correcting it.

433
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Every project has to be different.

434
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If you don't do projects

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that are too simple,

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
you have reached the optimum

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and nothing has changed in your life.

438
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You have to have another project like that.

439
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Every project has to be so complex

440
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
that in the end you see that you grow from it.

441
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Do you have to finish them?

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Unfinished projects are an experience.

443
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
When you realize that you have a lot of unfinished projects,

444
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
you have to ask yourself why they are unfinished.

445
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What does solving problems mean

446
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
in everyday life?

447
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How do you solve them?

448
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What kind of problems do you solve

449
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
as a programmer and how do you solve them?

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What kind of problems do you get

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and how do you solve them?

452
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What does this fight look like every day?

453
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Where do you get problems?

454
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You have enough problems in your life.

455
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If you start with some automation,

456
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
if you are preparing to do something repetitive,

457
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
you can get to it quickly.

458
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I have a problem that I would like to solve

459
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
in a programmer way.

460
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You can solve it on a blackboard.

461
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It is great that you can solve it on a blackboard

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and it is great that you can talk to other people

463
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
who are not necessarily seniors.

464
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Sometimes you just have to put things out of yourself

465
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
in a way that you can easily explain

466
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
what you are solving.

467
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Sometimes you have to ask yourself if you are not solving

468
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
something that is a part of the solution

469
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
that you don't know how to solve.

470
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
A lot of people come to me and say

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that they have a problem with a framework.

472
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You can tell them that their problem is a third one.

473
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They are explaining a part of the solution.

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You can always take that step back.

475
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
A blackboard is great because you can take that step

476
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
back in a physical form.

477
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
A while ago I got a question from a student

478
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
why do we have to program on paper?

479
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Why do we have to write code on paper?

480
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
As far as I can see,

481
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
you just try to explain what the problem is

482
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
when you write something on paper

483
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
or on a blackboard.

484
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Do I really understand what the problem is?

485
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is it clear to me what I have to do?

486
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Do I need more information?

487
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What is it that I don't know?

488
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What is it that I know?

489
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What is it that I don't know?

490
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What are the things that I have to get rid of?

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What are the limits?

492
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I would like to start talking about drafts in the problem.

493
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
As I said, there are hundreds of problems.

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
A good way is to use tools.

495
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
For example, if you play video games,

496
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
today you have different tools,

497
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
studio for making plugins,

498
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
or if you create music,

499
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
you will try to change some settings,

500
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
or find some scripts.

501
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Wherever you use a software,

502
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
you try to understand it,

503
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
then you try to break it,

504
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
or you try to prepare how it works,

505
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
or you try to automate it,

506
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
or you try to make an app for the phone,

507
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
or an app for VR,

508
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and then you go back.

509
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
As an engineer, you try to find problems,

510
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and you try to solve them yourself.

511
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Or on YouTube.

512
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
If we talk about day-to-day,

513
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
usually companies look for programmers,

514
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
that's why people come to the company,

515
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and usually, if they are big companies,

516
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
if they are juniors,

517
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
usually they are part of a team,

518
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
usually they are more experienced people,

519
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
who define some tasks,

520
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and then it depends on the company.

521
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
If you work in a satellite company,

522
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
you will probably work on satellites.

523
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
As a data scientist,

524
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
what problems do you solve every day,

525
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and how do you solve them?

526
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I always deal with the problem

527
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
that I have too little data.

528
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I always want to have more,

529
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
but I don't have to solve that problem.

530
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
There are problems that we solve,

531
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and from somewhere,

532
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
our art begins.

533
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We call it constraints.

534
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If you want to write poetry,

535
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
it's easier to write prose,

536
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
because you don't have a structure,

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
but if you want to write poetry,

538
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
you need to have a structure,

539
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and you have to, and so on.

540
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The most interesting thing is that

541
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
in the end, prose can be more pronounced.

542
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This part of my structure,

543
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
where I am limited,

544
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
means that I have too little data.

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Let's start with that.

546
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Let's try to take too little data,

547
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and put it back together

548
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
on the basis of some models,

549
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
as it seems to us.

550
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What are the processes

551
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
that generate too little data?

552
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What is the most likely thing

553
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
to happen in the future?

554
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Then we can make some business decisions.

555
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's transfer some money from some accounts

556
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to some other accounts.

557
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
OK, great.

558
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This connection with non-problematic,

559
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
real life,

560
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
what is the result of such work?

561
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's go back in history a bit.

562
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I will ask you again.

563
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Who were the first programmers?

564
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
How did they program?

565
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
How did it start?

566
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I believe it didn't start on Windows 95.

567
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
What was the beginning like?

568
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
How did it start?

569
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I first came across these personal computers.

570
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
No, they weren't personal.

571
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They weren't computers.

572
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They were Commodores and Spectrums.

573
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
In 1983-1984,

574
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
my colleagues started getting

575
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Spectrums,

576
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and then they started playing games.

577
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I saw them a couple of times,

578
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and they asked me at home,

579
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
if I was interested,

580
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and I told them that I wasn't.

581
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
My mother was working on some statistics,

582
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and they had a programming course.

583
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
My mother came home

584
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
with a basic script,

585
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
translated into Slovenian,

586
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
with 16 photocopies.

587
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I started getting lessons,

588
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and I saw that it was possible to program.

589
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I could say something to a computer,

590
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and it would do something for me.

591
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I was fascinated by it.

592
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
When I went to a party with my family,

593
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
if I had a computer,

594
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I would plug it into the TV,

595
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and I would play a game.

596
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That was my beginning.

597
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It was a basic,

598
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
where you wrote 10,

599
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
print Peter, and 20 go to 10,

600
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and then print Peter was printed

601
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
across the screen.

602
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Those were the beginnings.

603
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Then there was the 8th grade.

604
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I think it was the 3rd or 4th grade.

605
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We got our first teacher at school,

606
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
with a partner,

607
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and that's how I met Pascal.

608
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Then I was at Pascal for many years.

609
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Partners are not the same as computers.

610
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You should say that for younger listeners.

611
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Partners are not partners,

612
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
in the context of cooperation.

613
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What about you?

614
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The first computer I got,

615
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
when I was younger,

616
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
was a 286.

617
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It didn't even have a black and white screen.

618
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It had an orange screen.

619
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That was my first contact.

620
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
There were a lot of players,

621
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and I played a lot of games.

622
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That was my first experience.

623
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Later on, I worked with Pascal.

624
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Borland, Toru, Pascal...

625
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There are a lot of people

626
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
who know what's going on.

627
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I worked with them.

628
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Before that, I worked a lot

629
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
on the Internet.

630
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I worked on the first page

631
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
of Internet Explorer 4.

632
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Then I started learning HTML,

633
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
from some monitors.

634
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I spent my whole career

635
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
on the Internet.

636
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The more the Internet developed,

637
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the more I understood the platform.

638
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I worked a lot with it.

639
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
At the beginning of my career,

640
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I worked a lot with Flash.

641
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Some of you may know it.

642
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It was a tool

643
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
where you had a timeline

644
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
with a video editor,

645
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and you could make animations.

646
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You said, at this point,

647
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
the square will be here,

648
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and when the time comes,

649
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it will be here.

650
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It was visual,

651
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and you could make animations.

652
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It was interesting,

653
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
because you could click,

654
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and the editor opened,

655
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and you could write code inside.

656
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It surprised me.

657
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
When I came to high school,

658
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I expected to work on something more modern,

659
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
so I started working with Pascal.

660
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I had a pain in my back,

661
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
because I knew a bit about C,

662
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
so I could work with Pascal.

663
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I learned algorithms in high school

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
with Borland Pascal.

665
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm a bit younger,

666
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
but I'm obsessed with old computers,

667
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
so I collect old computers.

668
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Old computers...

669
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's hard to explain,

670
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
maybe harder than drugs in your family.

671
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Why do you collect old stuff?

672
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I started with 386,

673
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Windows 13,

674
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
then Windows 95 and 98.

675
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I started programming in Logo.

676
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's a programming language

677
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
where you go through a two-dimensional envelope

678
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and solve various things.

679
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think it was probably the best thing in the world

680
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
in terms of spatial representation.

681
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
First of all, it's phenomenally simple.

682
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You can get a lot of web pages

683
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
that allow a web interpreter for Logo.

684
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I recommend it.

685
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I tried it on my children.

686
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And it turns out that they love it.

687
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
They solve it and enjoy it.

688
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Because the visual component

689
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
makes it easier for people.

690
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Imagine a 5-year-old

691
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
solving a 90-degree cube.

692
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You don't have to explain it to him.

693
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He has the experience of trying to make a star or a square.

694
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Why not go in the same direction?

695
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Andrei Bitenc,

696
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
from ZRI,

697
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
who also had children in elementary school.

698
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Then relatively quickly,

699
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
in middle school, there were web pages.

700
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Back then, there were front pages.

701
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Most people probably don't remember that anymore.

702
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Then there were Dreamweavers,

703
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
a tool for working on the front page.

704
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It wasn't one-sided anymore.

705
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Maybe there were some other big corporations.

706
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We also started with Android relatively quickly.

707
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
There were 1.2, 1.5, 1.6 versions.

708
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We wrote tutorials with a colleague

709
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
on how to program.

710
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
There was also Eclipse,

711
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
which is no longer a favorite environment

712
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
for publishing.

713
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Back then, there was everything.

714
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Those were simple times

715
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
when you didn't have to install pip,

716
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but you could install it on 150 packages

717
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
so that you could make Hello World.

718
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Nice, simple times.

719
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I started with Windows 98.

720
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm not a programmer,

721
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
but that was the first Windows I used.

722
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Back then, if you wanted to make something,

723
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
you got either a CD or a floppy disk.

724
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I still remember floppy disks.

725
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I know why a floppy disk is a safe icon.

726
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You could also browse the Internet.

727
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It was much harder because you had to connect

728
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
over the phone.

729
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But if you wanted to get something on your computer,

730
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
you could install it.

731
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What was the development like back then?

732
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Who was doing what with some random applications?

733
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Why were they able to package it that way?

734
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What was the difference between

735
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
some random application

736
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and a connected application?

737
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The reason was very simple.

738
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Back then, there was no Internet.

739
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
When it appeared,

740
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
you had to browse the Internet

741
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and click on a modem on your phone.

742
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That's why you could have all the applications

743
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
on your computer.

744
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It was similar to what you have on your phone today.

745
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If you had an Android phone

746
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
without a data link,

747
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you could only use the games

748
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
or applications you have on your phone.

749
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I think that the analogy

750
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
with the telephone applications

751
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is quite good now.

752
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Who was writing

753
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
those random applications?

754
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
How were the engineers divided?

755
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What were they writing?

756
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Probably because Windows 98

757
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
was a different kind of elementary school.

758
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I wouldn't be able to say for sure.

759
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Maybe the difference was that

760
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
the younger generation felt

761
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
through the gaming console.

762
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The difference was that when you did it,

763
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you wrote it down on a piece of paper

764
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and sent it somewhere.

765
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
There was no room for the next update.

766
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We would fix what we forgot

767
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and we didn't do it well.

768
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think that the level of production

769
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
was higher because the price

770
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
of changing something like that

771
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
was higher than it is now.

772
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We can publish an application

773
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and move fast and break things.

774
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
We prepare the next week to fix something

775
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and then we can fix everything.

776
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It was especially difficult

777
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
because of the connectivity,

778
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
data transfer and media,

779
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
which were much slower and smaller.

780
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
People got used to one floppy disk,

781
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
1.44 megabytes.

782
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's a 16-bit picture from an iPhone

783
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and you can save it in that context.

784
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That floppy disk was very slow.

785
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You could only have two floppy disks

786
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
because there was a whole operating system

787
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
on one floppy disk.

788
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You could use it on the same floppy disk

789
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and get something out of it.

790
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
For example, help files for Windows 95

791
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
could be used on a 30 megabyte floppy disk

792
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
if you really tried hard.

793
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Otherwise, it was 150 megabytes.

794
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It was so expensive

795
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that we had to work harder

796
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
because of the applications we created.

797
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
We had to test them

798
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
because we felt like we were

799
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
doing it all over again.

800
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Now we know what testing looks like.

801
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The industry has some cycles

802
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
that are being repeated.

803
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Let's talk about writing applications

804
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and programming.

805
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Was there a difference between

806
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
back-end and front-end software?

807
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The biggest difference is probably

808
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
that we're going back to those times.

809
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I hope I won't have to say too much.

810
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We talked about Kadr in desktop applications.

811
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I have AutoCAD in my head

812
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
for constructing scripts.

813
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It was an app that worked

814
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
on a computer without any connection

815
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
to other computers.

816
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You set it up as we talked

817
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and drew a script on it.

818
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You drew it with a plotter

819
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
or you pressed it or whatever.

820
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The script was then used.

821
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
There were no physical changes

822
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
but there were media that were used.

823
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Kadr then worked with networks.

824
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Those terminals were called mainframes.

825
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Those were those huge computers

826
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
with their own operating systems

827
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
that were attached.

828
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
When the computers started to connect

829
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
you had that connection

830
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
to the terminal.

831
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What those terminals were like

832
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
is another story.

833
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But the concept of a plotter

834
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and then you connect to it

835
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
with your own computers

836
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
is still present today.

837
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We still see it but we don't talk

838
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
about those mainframes.

839
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think those two softwares

840
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
still exist.

841
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
A lot of theories and statements

842
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
still come from those.

843
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Terminals are like that,

844
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
servers are like that.

845
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
These things come from it.

846
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Basically, this software is good

847
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
to solve a problem.

848
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But it's not like those programs

849
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
or modern systems

850
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
where programs work together.

851
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's the thing.

852
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What did a back-end engineer do?

853
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
What did a front-end engineer do?

854
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Could there have been another engineer?

855
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I would say one thing

856
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
that would be different

857
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
is that programs were smaller

858
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
than they are now.

859
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Now you work with big teams.

860
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I remember when we wrote

861
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the first Windows desktop applications.

862
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
There was a program environment

863
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
very popular called Delphi.

864
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The middle Pascal.

865
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Pascal was given an add-on

866
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
for an object programming.

867
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Then some graphic designers

868
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
started working on it.

869
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Delphi was one of the most ingenious

870
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
programming tools at the time.

871
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What was interesting

872
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
was that Delphi was written

873
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
by 3 or 4 programmers

874
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
in a big company called Borland.

875
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That was a product

876
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that the company probably lived off

877
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
for another 10 years.

878
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The gentleman who invented Delphi

879
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
went on to work with Microsoft

880
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and then wrote C Sharp

881
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and TypeScript and so on.

882
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Andres Heisberg.

883
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
What was interesting here

884
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
was that 4 people did it.

885
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
They probably split the work,

886
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
but most of them did everything.

887
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Software was also typical at the time.

888
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
In Slovenia, there was a typical

889
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
software company called One Man Band

890
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and this man did everything

891
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
from the calculations to the database

892
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
to the users and so on.

893
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
With all this software,

894
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
especially if it's bigger,

895
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
you have people who are architects

896
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
and their job is to take care

897
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
of where certain components are,

898
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
how they will grow,

899
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
how they will change.

900
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Then the architects decide

901
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
how the application will be split.

902
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Will we need a back-end developer

903
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
or a front-end developer

904
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
or will it be one person

905
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
who will do everything?

906
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
If we look at Wikipedia

907
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and the big eggs in the programs

908
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
of the same region,

909
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Windows 95, Windows 98,

910
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
they weren't that big a team.

911
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
At the end of that team,

912
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
there were a few people

913
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
who knew better or worse abilities

914
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
of others and managed to coordinate them.

915
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Even if we look at the descriptions

916
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
of those people in the 30s,

917
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
they don't have all the beautiful

918
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
descriptions of samurais and everything

919
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
that we have now.

920
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
On the other hand,

921
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
we probably have 500 people

922
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
in the Microsoft team

923
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
who deal with the search bar

924
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and a lot of things were put

925
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
more ad hoc than they are now.

926
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
On the other hand,

927
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
we will return to the fact

928
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
that some things are not as important

929
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
as others.

930
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
There is a stereotype

931
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
that front-end is easy,

932
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
back-end is hard,

933
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
but I don't think so,

934
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
because you can do it in any way.

935
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Back-end was a real engineering.

936
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I can try.

937
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
In this context,

938
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
the first thing is that

939
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
front-end is not for everyone.

940
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I have a few colleagues

941
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
who are phenomenal back-enders,

942
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
maybe it's connected

943
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
to some other property,

944
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
maybe talent for art

945
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
or visual composition.

946
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
On the front-end,

947
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
if you break things,

948
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
they are broken in a way

949
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
that doesn't affect the whole structure.

950
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But I still think that at some point,

951
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
people who have 30 years of experience

952
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
will see the difference

953
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
between what is more appealing

954
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and what is more talented.

955
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I wouldn't say that front-end is easier

956
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
or harder.

957
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Everyone should combine.

958
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I wouldn't say that back-end is harder,

959
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
because it can be at the end

960
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
very similar to front-end.

961
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You don't have to imagine

962
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
big architectural systems

963
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
at every moment.

964
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I wouldn't say that front-end

965
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
is harder or harder.

966
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Maybe it's more appealing

967
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
to some people,

968
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
but not to others.

969
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I've been working on front-end

970
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
for many years now.

971
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
In front-end,

972
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
things are very visual.

973
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
When you do something there,

974
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you can see what you've done.

975
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You can adjust your time very quickly.

976
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You can't hide.

977
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You can see the consequences.

978
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
When the functionality

979
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
of a product goes out,

980
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
it will be very fast.

981
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You will be the one who will say

982
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that you've done your job

983
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and now it's over.

984
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
People don't see the back-end.

985
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and sometimes it's even harder to adjust what you're doing in the back if it's not visible.

986
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And some people enjoy the default system, as he said,

987
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
but the front end does not exist without the back end, and vice versa.

988
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
These things have to be connected, and if the back end doesn't work,

989
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
you can have a very nice make-up and nothing will work.

990
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So we have to take these things into some kind of synergy.

991
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Both things are tribal.

992
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Especially in the last few years, I think that these specializations have created

993
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
that these things are more diverse.

994
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I think that in the past we had a term called web developer,

995
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and it meant that you did everything.

996
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Today, perhaps, it's a bit more physical, but for beginners,

997
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I think it's always good to understand the universe,

998
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
to understand what's in the back and what's in the front.

999
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Because you won't be able to communicate with people

1000
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
if you don't understand both sides.

1001
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Everything is in some basics.

1002
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
But maybe it also stems from the fact that,

1003
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
for example, if we take a typical software from 20 years ago,

1004
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
you drive it to some public back end,

1005
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and in the front you have HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

1006
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
We are already working in technology.

1007
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But it also stems from the fact that you are closer to the current technology.

1008
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You can be a very good public developer,

1009
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and in short, a very good JavaScript and HTML and CSS developer.

1010
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yes, probably.

1011
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But I would also say that something is the same as your love,

1012
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
your passion, something is the same as what you did

1013
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
to get through that frustration and get to the end.

1014
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
From the point of view of the back end,

1015
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
what Otto wanted to say,

1016
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
the conversation of a system engineer.

1017
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
When everything works, we don't know why they pay you,

1018
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and when something doesn't work, you are still guilty.

1019
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Because it doesn't work, so we could.

1020
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yes, the back end can be more tricky from that point of view.

1021
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But all in all, I remember from those times,

1022
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
now we will change one programming language,

1023
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
which will hurt a lot, PHP.

1024
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
From those times when we wrote that part in PHP,

1025
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
when we came to the first MWCs,

1026
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
what was it, Symfony, PHP Cake, Zend, and so on.

1027
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yes, we did something in CSS,

1028
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
but we didn't deal with the design in that way.

1029
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
On the other hand, we have in all categories,

1030
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
we have to look at which ones will suit each other,

1031
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and we now have phenomenal designers

1032
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
who are very focused in the technological aspect,

1033
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
in the web, in the specifics of it.

1034
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
We have designers who will work on leaflets and pamphlets

1035
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
but they will never touch the web.

1036
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And if you compare both outputs,

1037
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
one is very good for something,

1038
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and it's great as a designer for that package,

1039
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
for that leaflet, for that CGP, in that way.

1040
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
The other is phenomenal for implementing it on the website.

1041
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I think it's the same with programmers.

1042
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
We are not all good for everything.

1043
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
We can be good, quite good,

1044
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
because of a project, let's say.

1045
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
But we don't have to be great in the sense

1046
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
that we will use our talent for everything.

1047
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I would like to add something.

1048
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
As a beginner, it's not so...

1049
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's not so...

1050
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I call myself a backend developer,

1051
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I call myself a frontend developer.

1052
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Your job...

1053
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's better to try as much as you can at the beginning,

1054
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
to play as much as you can.

1055
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
We talked about frontend and backend.

1056
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
You also have mobile,

1057
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
you also have games,

1058
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
you also have electronic programming.

1059
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Try as much as you can,

1060
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and you will hear,

1061
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
oh, I can make an interface,

1062
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and it's great.

1063
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Maybe you can do it later.

1064
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
We have already mentioned the web.

1065
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Before, we were talking about web applications.

1066
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
How did the web change that?

1067
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And what exactly do you program in the browser?

1068
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Because web applications work differently

1069
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
than if you are only in the browser.

1070
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
The web has brought with it

1071
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
such an interesting concept,

1072
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
especially since it came from

1073
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the classical static split pages.

1074
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The first split pages were created by the server.

1075
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It was a static HTML,

1076
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and then it was tampered with,

1077
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and when something went wrong,

1078
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
it went back to the server.

1079
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Then, at one point, we started working

1080
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
with single-page dynamic applications.

1081
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And what has changed?

1082
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Back then, software was also written on the frontend.

1083
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And we started with very primitive tools,

1084
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
such as jQuery and so on.

1085
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
These were then huge repositories

1086
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
of unmanageable spaghetti codes.

1087
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And what web development has brought with it,

1088
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
is the fact that it was decoupled

1089
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
from the browser,

1090
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
from the business logic on the backend,

1091
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and from the user logic on the frontend.

1092
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And these two could communicate

1093
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
in a nice and elegant way.

1094
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The second thing is that

1095
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
in the frontend environment,

1096
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
there was a problem.

1097
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The classical way of compiling applications

1098
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and learning functionality,

1099
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
so that when something clicked,

1100
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
something happened.

1101
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
When it was stopped with jQuery

1102
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and the classic JavaScript tool,

1103
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
they simply stopped together,

1104
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and then they were looking for better solutions

1105
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
to solve these problems,

1106
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
how to structure these frontend applications.

1107
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And the solutions that appeared,

1108
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
and are still appearing,

1109
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
were very beautiful.

1110
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And this way of thinking,

1111
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
the frontend,

1112
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I think, works in its own way.

1113
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
In many ways, the frontend is the one

1114
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
that pulls the computer industry forward

1115
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
with new ideas and concepts.

1116
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And then these concepts

1117
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
settle on the backend.

1118
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Take V8 and make a runtime environment

1119
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
for JavaScript,

1120
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and then you go to Node,

1121
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
where you can write JavaScript

1122
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
on the frontend and the backend.

1123
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Has this changed people's day-to-day jobs?

1124
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
If I look at Twitter,

1125
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
they started adding abstraction levels.

1126
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
There was also a Mootool project.

1127
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
A drag-and-drop operation

1128
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
with 2,000 types of code.

1129
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
At some point,

1130
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
we created one type of code in jQuery,

1131
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and if we look back at jQuery now,

1132
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
we say, what have I done?

1133
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I had such huge functions written

1134
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
that something small happened.

1135
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
These levels of abstraction

1136
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
started to be added,

1137
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and how to integrate all of this

1138
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
is problematic.

1139
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I work in the operating system,

1140
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and I always say that 99% of the questions

1141
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
about this subject are answers from legacy.

1142
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Why do we call a terminal a terminal?

1143
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Why do we use an icon?

1144
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And so on.

1145
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
We are so old now

1146
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
that we know why this is so.

1147
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Some things are phenomenally illogical

1148
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
for a beginner.

1149
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Sometimes you have the feeling

1150
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
that you can turn everything off

1151
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and start writing anew.

1152
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's stupid.

1153
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
A bunch of stories show

1154
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
that Johnny did something on Tuesday

1155
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
and said, this is it.

1156
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Let's look at bash.

1157
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
This thing is totally broken.

1158
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Before Microsoft said,

1159
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
let's do a few more,

1160
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and all the names were shown

1161
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
to be Japanese.

1162
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
They have at least 15 characters.

1163
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
But these levels of abstraction

1164
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
maybe scare us a bit,

1165
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
even us old people,

1166
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
because there are so many of them.

1167
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
You have a stack on the front end,

1168
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and a stack on the back end.

1169
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
This is running in some

1170
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
virtualization environments

1171
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
that have their own stack.

1172
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
In the past, we installed LAMP

1173
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
in Apache.

1174
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
We put it in the folder

1175
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
and it worked.

1176
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And that was it.

1177
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Do you really have to know everything

1178
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
to be able to do it?

1179
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
No, but it's a huge advantage

1180
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
for a beginner to be able

1181
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
to do so many things.

1182
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Why can't you just install

1183
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
150 lines to write Hello World?

1184
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
In Pascal, we added a diskette

1185
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
that ran the whole system

1186
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
together with the text editor.

1187
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And that was it.

1188
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
A lot of diskettes and editors

1189
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
ran from the compiled program.

1190
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And that was it.

1191
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I think it's a huge advantage

1192
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
for all of us in the industry.

1193
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
On the other hand,

1194
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
we have to ask ourselves

1195
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
how many people,

1196
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
with all their signs,

1197
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
actually know these things.

1198
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Probably more or less.

1199
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Those who know

1200
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
are already very close to retirement.

1201
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And this knowledge,

1202
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
this transfer of knowledge,

1203
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
we have to give a certain gift

1204
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and ask ourselves

1205
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
if it's enough

1206
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
if we learn everything now,

1207
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
whether we are developers

1208
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and use this book,

1209
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and that book,

1210
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and another book,

1211
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
do we want people to realize

1212
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
that such books are capable

1213
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
of self-development

1214
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and are capable of completing

1215
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
this never-ending stack.

1216
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
The last step of this

1217
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
is the NoCode platform.

1218
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
You don't even use

1219
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
a mobile app anymore.

1220
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
If we talk about NoCode

1221
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
and serverless,

1222
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
why companies

1223
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
are adopting

1224
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
serverless and NoCode tools

1225
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
is exactly because of this.

1226
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Now you have to realize

1227
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
that you don't care

1228
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
about these things anymore.

1229
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
The boss is happy,

1230
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
the company is happy,

1231
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I'm crying, I hope.

1232
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Every level of abstraction

1233
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
that we add

1234
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
has a set of things

1235
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
at the very beginning.

1236
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
But the level of abstraction

1237
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
that we add doesn't mean

1238
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
that it automatically reduces

1239
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
the complexity of the bottom.

1240
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It just removes it

1241
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
or hides it a little.

1242
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Even if we were historically

1243
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
like Peter said,

1244
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
writing Go To,

1245
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
or even Assemble,

1246
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
it would be even more brutal.

1247
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Now we've made levels, levels, levels,

1248
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
levels, levels, levels,

1249
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
and now NoCode will

1250
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
pull it down

1251
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
year after year,

1252
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
because you don't program anything anymore.

1253
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
But Assemble still works.

1254
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You can still find a job

1255
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
to work with Assemble.

1256
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And all these stacks are jobs.

1257
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I would add

1258
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
that we are working

1259
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
on these abstractions.

1260
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Sometimes we even find them.

1261
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
A nice example is

1262
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Frontend,

1263
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
where they are using

1264
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
an architecture

1265
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
called React,

1266
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
State Management,

1267
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
which is already called

1268
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Redux.

1269
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Redux is an abstraction

1270
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
that was invented in another

1271
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
programming language called Elm.

1272
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And then they saw it in Elm

1273
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and said,

1274
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
maybe we could

1275
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
use a similar concept

1276
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
in JavaScript.

1277
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But it's a little difficult,

1278
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
because JavaScript is

1279
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
a different language,

1280
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and these things are not

1281
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
one-to-one mapped.

1282
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
This original Elm,

1283
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
or something like that,

1284
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
a rare company

1285
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
implemented a complete Redux

1286
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
that was presented

1287
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
from Elm

1288
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
in JavaScript.

1289
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Again, I can't imagine

1290
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
why something is needed,

1291
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
and they said,

1292
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
we won't do that.

1293
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
But then it turns out

1294
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
that when you start

1295
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
assembling together,

1296
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
more complex things

1297
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
come together than

1298
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Lego bricks.

1299
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And here is the problem

1300
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
that we have

1301
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
so many abstractions

1302
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
in the computer.

1303
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
We would like

1304
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
to express ourselves

1305
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
on a higher

1306
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
abstract level.

1307
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I wouldn't like to

1308
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
do everything myself,

1309
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
but since we used abstractions

1310
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
that were poorly translated

1311
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
into another programming language,

1312
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
we need to know

1313
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
what's going on down there.

1314
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's not easy.

1315
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Let's get back to

1316
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
why you need to program on paper.

1317
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Because it increases

1318
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
your internal buffer.

1319
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Why do you need to understand

1320
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
or burn a couple of LEDs

1321
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
in an assembly on a development board?

1322
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Why do you need to know

1323
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
how UART works?

1324
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
There are a lot of things

1325
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
that may seem banal,

1326
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
but on the other hand,

1327
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
it gives us the depth

1328
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
where we can understand

1329
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
or develop things more easily.

1330
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
A typical example

1331
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
when we did the first Android apps.

1332
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You need a state machine

1333
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
for messaging,

1334
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
or if we look at what happens

1335
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
when you turn off the application

1336
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and then turn it on,

1337
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
there are a lot of states

1338
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
in the modern frameworks.

1339
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
One colleague,

1340
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
who is a great Flutter programmer

1341
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
from Alpha,

1342
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
has as much experience as Flutter,

1343
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
but not as much

1344
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
as the people

1345
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
who write their stories.

1346
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
They have more experience

1347
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
than the programming language

1348
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
in the city.

1349
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
One time,

1350
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
when we were talking,

1351
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
he said,

1352
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
why would you write an app

1353
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
if you couldn't write an app?

1354
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
One guy came and said,

1355
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
we know how to do it in C,

1356
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
for Android.

1357
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You see,

1358
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
this level,

1359
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
maybe 10 years of difference

1360
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
between us,

1361
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
gives me something very familiar

1362
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
and state-of-the-art

1363
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
in my perception

1364
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
of what is Flutter capable of.

1365
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Understanding how these state machines

1366
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
interact with each other.

1367
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
If you don't want to

1368
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
hit anything,

1369
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
you get into trouble

1370
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
where you reach your optimum

1371
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and you say,

1372
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I did this,

1373
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
and I'll do it again.

1374
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You quickly get to the point

1375
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
where you start

1376
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
implicitly learning these things.

1377
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Which is great,

1378
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
because there is

1379
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
a hidden dark web,

1380
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
hidden in the projects.

1381
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
We are already talking a lot.

1382
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
We are getting close

1383
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
to the end,

1384
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
so I will stop

1385
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and ask specifically.

1386
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Today, someone who is going

1387
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
on this path,

1388
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
where does it start?

1389
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
In which programming language?

1390
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Is it mobile development?

1391
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Is it splat development?

1392
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Will it be you?

1393
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Where does it start?

1394
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Probably Python,

1395
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
and JavaScript.

1396
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I think that today

1397
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
most of the computational paths

1398
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
start with Python.

1399
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I think it's both

1400
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
a great language for learning.

1401
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Where does it start?

1402
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
On the one hand,

1403
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
you find a problem

1404
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
that you would like to solve.

1405
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
On the other hand,

1406
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I don't know,

1407
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
these complex portals with

1408
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
some kind of requirements.

1409
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I think that you can

1410
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
learn a lot from them.

1411
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The question is

1412
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
whether

1413
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
these requirements

1414
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
are presented

1415
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
in the right way.

1416
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
If they are presented in the right way,

1417
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
then

1418
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
the complexity

1419
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
gradually decreases.

1420
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Sometimes you start

1421
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
solving two tasks,

1422
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and the third one is like that.

1423
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
In the last year,

1424
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
my expectations

1425
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
have increased.

1426
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The same with Python.

1427
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I solved two or three tasks,

1428
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
but the fourth one

1429
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
seemed too easy for me.

1430
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I really took a lot of time

1431
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
to figure out

1432
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
what programming is for.

1433
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Where do you start?

1434
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
At the faculty?

1435
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
At the university program,

1436
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
we start with Java and C.

1437
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
At the university program,

1438
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
we start with Java and Python.

1439
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It's always a debate

1440
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
whether I need to know C or not.

1441
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Java has references,

1442
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
which is basically pointer to pointer.

1443
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
If you know what a pointer is,

1444
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I wouldn't say for a beginner

1445
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
to start with C.

1446
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I can say that

1447
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
you can start with C.

1448
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Come for free.

1449
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
What can the faculty give you?

1450
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It can't give you all the knowledge

1451
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
we have available

1452
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
on mobile devices and computers.

1453
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
There are people

1454
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
who can ask you in a very

1455
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
stupid way,

1456
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I don't need to be an expert,

1457
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't need to know what to google,

1458
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I don't need to know which tutorial

1459
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
to find on the internet.

1460
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There are people who will

1461
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
give you all the knowledge.

1462
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Free has the beauty

1463
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
of making a relatively open

1464
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
room for other faculties.

1465
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You can come to any laboratory

1466
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and ask for a cup of coffee.

1467
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You don't have to worry

1468
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
that it's someone

1469
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
who has a doctorate

1470
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
and isn't a doctorate

1471
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
or is a professor.

1472
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
You can come to any of them

1473
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and say that you have a problem

1474
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and they help you solve it.

1475
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Then you get people

1476
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
who will welcome you

1477
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
and say that they have solved

1478
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
a very complex problem.

1479
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
If I may ask you,

1480
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
why do I go to free

1481
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
rather than to math

1482
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
or physics?

1483
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
After all, I see people

1484
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
who come from different

1485
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Norwegian faculties

1486
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
in programming.

1487
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
That's a good question.

1488
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
From this point of view,

1489
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
two students from all

1490
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Norwegian technical faculties

1491
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
could be relatively the same.

1492
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The difference is

1493
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
in the applicability.

1494
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Probably in math and physics

1495
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
students deal with different

1496
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
problems than we do.

1497
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
We will go to the application

1498
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
for a specific field

1499
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and specific problems.

1500
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The theoretical part

1501
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
will probably be more powerful

1502
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
there.

1503
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I am on a relatively high level

1504
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and you can find people

1505
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
everywhere

1506
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
where you can come to them

1507
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
and say that you have a problem

1508
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
or they will help you

1509
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
solve it.

1510
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
That's the beauty of FACS.

1511
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Nowadays, when we realized

1512
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
that everyone can work

1513
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
online and watch lectures,

1514
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
personal contact is the only

1515
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
thing the faculty can give you

1516
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
if you don't need all the knowledge.

1517
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't need to do as good

1518
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
a lecture as someone on Coursera

1519
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
who did one lecture in three months.

1520
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
What we can give you is

1521
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
that you come to me, we work

1522
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
together on some problems,

1523
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
we work together on complex tasks

1524
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and I can help you and guide you.

1525
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
That's the only added value

1526
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
of FACS.

1527
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You have all the other things

1528
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
on the internet.

1529
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
You can sit down and discuss

1530
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
all the knowledge through YouTube

1531
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
or through FACS.

1532
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Most of us are mortals

1533
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
and we need someone who has

1534
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
been through a lot

1535
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
to help us along the way.

1536
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's why.

1537
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Jesus, you are so well-founded.

1538
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
When are you going to sign up?

1539
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
No, you sold well.

1540
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I am also a high school teacher

1541
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
for those who have to go to high school.

1542
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You can tell them the same.

1543
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
The thing is

1544
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
that most people

1545
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
who work in this industry

1546
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
really have a passion

1547
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
for technology.

1548
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
They like to talk about it.

1549
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
They like to help.

1550
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Most of the people

1551
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
will want to help you.

1552
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Don't be afraid to ask.

1553
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I know it's hard to ask.

1554
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I know that sometimes

1555
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
it's natural to ask.

1556
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I know that sometimes

1557
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
people will help you

1558
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
in a special way.

1559
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
The world is so connected

1560
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
that you really have

1561
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
a lot of communities

1562
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
for everything.

1563
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Maybe it's English

1564
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and you learn English smartly.

1565
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
But you also have a community

1566
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
in Slovenia.

1567
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
You have a Python meetup,

1568
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
an ARM meetup,

1569
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
a JavaScript meetup.

1570
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You have events

1571
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
with people who already know it.

1572
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
That's a great way

1573
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
to do it.

1574
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
When it comes to technology,

1575
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
try as many

1576
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
different things as you can.

1577
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Then say

1578
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I will learn one thing well,

1579
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
whatever it is,

1580
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
to go through

1581
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
one language from start to finish.

1582
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Whether it's Java

1583
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
or C++.

1584
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Finish the book

1585
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
so you can learn

1586
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
some things.

1587
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
When you switch languages,

1588
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
you have to learn

1589
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
the difference

1590
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
or the specifics.

1591
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
A lot of

1592
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
basic algorithms

1593
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
are transferable.

1594
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
A lot of knowledge is transferable.

1595
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
When we talk about abstractions,

1596
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
a lot of abstractions are transferable.

1597
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
You have to go through

1598
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
the book

1599
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
from start to finish.

1600
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I would recommend

1601
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
a lot of side projects.

1602
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
A lot of side projects.

1603
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
What are side projects?

1604
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
We can ask the guests.

1605
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
If you can,

1606
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
you can ask the last question.

1607
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
No, I think

1608
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
in 15 minutes

1609
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
the last one

1610
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
will be over.

1611
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Great,

1612
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
thank you for doing this.

1613
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
What would you like, Peter,

1614
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
for a junior to bring with him

1615
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
when he joins your team?

1616
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
What would he or she

1617
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
already know?

1618
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
What can they learn?

1619
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
My team is very specific

1620
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
because we work on data science.

1621
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Data science

1622
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
is a national

1623
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
endeavor.

1624
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
It's a medical space.

1625
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It's a medical space.

1626
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It's a medical space.

1627
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Data science is like the next big thing, and everyone wanted to be a data scientist,

1628
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
but that's not true.

1629
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
In order to be a good data scientist, you need to be very good at programming,

1630
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
you need to be very good at math, especially in statistics,

1631
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
you often get a certificate in mathematics, you don't have to, right?

1632
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Well, I think there was a third one, but I don't remember.

1633
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
There was a third one.

1634
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Blackmagic will do it.

1635
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And now people are introducing themselves,

1636
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I know how to write in those Pandas, Python notebooks, some graphs,

1637
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and now I will be a data scientist.

1638
01:15:48,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So, I think that in my field, people can use music, but they don't.

1639
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I think people can use statistics and probability,

1640
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and I think that's a very valuable thing,

1641
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and I think that's another thing you would want to program.

1642
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It has the capacity, and the desire to solve problems.

1643
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So, maybe I, if I have to answer,

1644
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
who would I like to have in my team?

1645
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I have 30 years of experience.

1646
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:42,000
On the other hand, we have some young people,

1647
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:49,000
and it's fascinating how they have the right approach,

1648
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
it's interesting, it's okay to solve this problem,

1649
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
but what else can I do?

1650
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Mateo, at the beginning we didn't say that you are not only a teacher,

1651
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
but you also work a lot with companies,

1652
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,000
so you probably have a look at what Fax gives to someone,

1653
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
and what Fax doesn't prepare people who join.

1654
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yes, because of that, who would I like to have in my team?

1655
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Highly motivated people.

1656
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
That's it, primarily.

1657
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Everything else, we will get to that, no problem,

1658
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
we will get to that, you will know, you will have a certain level.

1659
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And I think, because of cooperation with the economy,

1660
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I would say that what Fax gives you,

1661
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
is that sometimes you have to believe that we know why it's good,

1662
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
that you know the jigsaw,

1663
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
even if you don't know at the moment why it's good.

1664
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
But if you come to Peter in five years,

1665
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
you would think that these are simple problems,

1666
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
that you can solve them.

1667
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Depending on the specific frame,

1668
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
or orientation in a specific direction or topic,

1669
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
people need motivation.

1670
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
When people come motivated,

1671
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
yes, everyone has a little more or less listening,

1672
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
and of course we all want the most listening,

1673
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
but if people don't have motivation,

1674
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
then they usually don't give you a fax,

1675
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and they usually know that in the quality of the projects,

1676
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
the way of cooperation, freelancing or employment.

1677
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Then this is somehow taken away in other aspects.

1678
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Rarely, a person would say that he doesn't need a fax,

1679
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
because it's good.

1680
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Because these are the people who made a fax for Zravan,

1681
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
who did it, because it wasn't hard for them.

1682
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Some of you had tears,

1683
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
some of you were my classmates,

1684
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
when I was a graduate,

1685
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
and I can say that these are phenomenal people,

1686
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
who would say that you don't need a fax.

1687
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
But sometimes you have to go through a very difficult topic,

1688
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
which is very challenging for you,

1689
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
because your partner,

1690
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
who went through a similar topic in three years,

1691
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
says that if he was able to go through it,

1692
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
then he would be able to finish the project.

1693
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I can also say that we had some topics

1694
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
that were shared with me.

1695
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Why would I need it?

1696
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
For example, we had a lecture

1697
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
on computer technology,

1698
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
which was taught by Professor Sretkar.

1699
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I said that your older colleagues

1700
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
will tell you that it's physics 2,

1701
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
but if you look at computers,

1702
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
what is different from physics?

1703
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Then you start to put electrons

1704
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
into infinite potential holes.

1705
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Sometimes 10 to the minus 34.

1706
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
We didn't even know what it had to do

1707
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
with our forces on the slope.

1708
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
That's physics, of course.

1709
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You know it from high school.

1710
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
But 10-15 years later,

1711
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
we're working on a scheme

1712
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
of automatic elucidation of organic bonds.

1713
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Basically, we're trying to automate

1714
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
the understanding of spectra,

1715
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
on different spectra,

1716
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
which have their own flaws,

1717
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
which are maybe a bit blurred,

1718
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
which are not all visible.

1719
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
We're trying to use all this knowledge

1720
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
from this subject to understand

1721
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
what they're trying to explain

1722
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
to us through some tables

1723
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
that have been calculated in the last 100 years.

1724
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
In the meantime, you have to have

1725
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
a bit of faith that your boss,

1726
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
or whoever he is, knows

1727
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
that there's a good reason

1728
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
why this moment doesn't seem

1729
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
so important to you.

1730
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Because in five years,

1731
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
this probability and statistics

1732
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
will be very important

1733
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
for your understanding

1734
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
of our problems on our farm.

1735
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
No, that's too long.

1736
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
No, no, it's cool.

1737
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I always have an answer.

1738
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
The most valuable part,

1739
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
the most valuable employee,

1740
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
the most valuable colleague

1741
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
with whom I work,

1742
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
and we can all talk about this

1743
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
in technology later,

1744
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
but what does it mean

1745
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
that he has it?

1746
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
If someone,

1747
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
you said motivated,

1748
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
means that he will find

1749
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
this energy,

1750
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
that he will learn

1751
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
what he doesn't know yet,

1752
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
that if he,

1753
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
if we go to the very beginning

1754
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
of our conversation,

1755
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
that if he comes to the problem

1756
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
that he will grind,

1757
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
that he will learn,

1758
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
that he will research,

1759
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
that he will look,

1760
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
that he will grow,

1761
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
that he will shoot,

1762
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
whatever.

1763
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
That desire,

1764
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
it can be overcome,

1765
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
but that's what you need

1766
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
in the end.

1767
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
If you want,

1768
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
you have different teams,

1769
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
but for me,

1770
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
the most important thing

1771
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
is motivation.

1772
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
You can try this

1773
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
through CV,

1774
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
through references,

1775
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
through experience,

1776
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
through 5 projects,

1777
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
whatever,

1778
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
but I always looked for

1779
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
this interest,

1780
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
this desire.

1781
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Such people will learn.

1782
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
You can't buy it.

1783
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
From this recruiting,

1784
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
when you get

1785
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
the first game server I made

1786
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
when I was 12 years old,

1787
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I put it in the room

1788
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
and there were a million users

1789
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
when I was 12 years old.

1790
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
This real

1791
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
motivation.

1792
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
At the same time,

1793
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
this real motivation.

1794
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
It probably takes a long time.

1795
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Maybe it looks like

1796
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
someone who comes to FACS

1797
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
without actually

1798
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
trying.

1799
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Again, it's about motivation.

1800
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Everything else comes with time.

1801
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
But the motivation

1802
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and loyalty,

1803
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
that you are there.

1804
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
These are two components

1805
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
of a person

1806
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
that are the most important.

1807
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Because of this,

1808
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
this person will be able

1809
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
to finish the project

1810
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
because he will be there

1811
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
or he doesn't have the motivation

1812
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
for a long time or

1813
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
for three years.

1814
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You have to be satisfied

1815
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
in a way that

1816
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
you set yourself

1817
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
some goals.

1818
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Some ambitious goals.

1819
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
You sometimes say

1820
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I will become the best

1821
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
back-end developer.

1822
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
It's better to say

1823
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I will do this project

1824
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
and you do it.

1825
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
You get some satisfaction from it

1826
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and you do the next project.

1827
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It's much better

1828
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
if you set yourself

1829
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
a long-term

1830
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
and unrealistic goal

1831
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and then you push it.

1832
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
It's better to cut

1833
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
the path to some side projects

1834
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
and then you get

1835
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
the feedback loop

1836
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that you did something good

1837
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and you develop it

1838
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
habitually.

1839
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Habitually.

1840
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Habitually.

1841
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
That was

1842
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
a really great

1843
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
summary of what

1844
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'm learning.

1845
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Mata, I would like to ask

1846
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
one more summary

1847
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
for people

1848
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
who come to this industry.

1849
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I would really

1850
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
rely on what he said.

1851
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
A big part

1852
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
of the IT industry

1853
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
is

1854
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
this.

1855
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Maybe this is also

1856
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
a part of engineering.

1857
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
How to

1858
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
solve

1859
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
a problem

1860
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
in a way

1861
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
that

1862
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
every problem

1863
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
is a whole

1864
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
that can be

1865
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
disassembled and tested

1866
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
and something starts again.

1867
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
These parts

1868
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
are

1869
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
equally

1870
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
big.

1871
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You can do one or two a day.

1872
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
My experience

1873
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and what I remember

1874
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
from my colleagues

1875
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
30 years ago

1876
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
when we learned to program

1877
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and more.

1878
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Even now, I think

1879
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
it's true.

1880
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You imagine something

1881
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
that is too complex,

1882
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
and then you don't know

1883
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
where to start.

1884
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
We start short

1885
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
and see that

1886
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
what we put together

1887
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
doesn't come.

1888
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
How to build

1889
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
like a cake.

1890
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
First a layer of

1891
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
dough, then a cream,

1892
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
then a little more dough.

1893
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I agree with both.

1894
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
In the end,

1895
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
we all know

1896
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
XKCD as a funny

1897
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
video game that comes out

1898
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
three times a week.

1899
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
There is a good picture

1900
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
of what is the most effective.

1901
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
800 hours of lectures,

1902
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
400 hours of homework,

1903
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
or one weekend of playing with a ball.

1904
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Maybe it's so hard

1905
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
to play

1906
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
that the kids

1907
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
won't know what a ball is.

1908
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
They don't need to know.

1909
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Just try it.

1910
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
When you were a kid,

1911
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
you used to disassemble a computer.

1912
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
You were crazy about it,

1913
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
but you wanted to know

1914
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
what's inside.

1915
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Just the motivation

1916
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
is all you need.

1917
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I have nothing more to add.

1918
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Great, isn't it?

1919
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I don't know.

1920
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I can only say

1921
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
thank you a lot.

1922
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
No, you can thank yourself.

1923
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I would just say

1924
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
to share this episode

1925
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
with your colleagues

1926
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
who may be trying

1927
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
in this direction.

1928
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Give us feedback

1929
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
to see how far we are from the truth.

1930
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
You decide.

1931
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Thank you,

1932
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Petr, and thank you,

1933
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Mateo, for taking the time.

1934
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I hope it wasn't too short.

1935
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Thank you, Oto, for letting me

1936
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
host this podcast.

1937
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I hope it wasn't too short, either.

1938
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It wasn't.

1939
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I hope you enjoyed it.

1940
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Maybe I'll say it one more time.

1941
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Share, like,

1942
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
get as many people

1943
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
as possible.
