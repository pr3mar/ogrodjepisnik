00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello, hello, Andrej. In the next episode of Ogrodje, we are in season 2, episode 15, and in the third episode of Zagora, where we will talk today about the work in progress,

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and how to look for it. For those of you who do not know us yet, I am Sara Vašine Gašpar and today with me is Andrej Fodor.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We have known each other for quite some time, we met in 2020, and although at the beginning of the pandemic, the work is still on a larger scale.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:08,000
First, if we start very quickly, who do you think you are? Let's introduce you a little. You will probably be alone, right?

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, I can. First of all, thank you for the invitation, I am a fan of Ogrodje, so it's great to be a guest. I hope I can say something smart today.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My name is Andrej, I've been running startups for 10 years, and I was one of the first. In 2018-2019, I started remote work, and now I help companies find individuals in the tech space.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:06,000
On the contrary, I often help individuals I know, or from our tech community, to find interesting remote opportunities, because I think that with this we enable a lot of people who are locally positioned to come and play in the NBA instead of staying in your league.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well said. When I was working on the plan for this episode, we really wanted to focus on the search for remote work. Then we asked our listeners, and I really felt the need to talk about remote work in general,

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to compare it with other forms of work, and to touch on it a little. So maybe I would start with that. First, let's talk about how remote work works. We all know that remote work has experienced a very big increase, especially during the pandemic.

10
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In the ZDA, from 6% of remote work, it jumped to 50% in 2020, and then this share began to decrease. But by and large, just under 40% of all global scientific workers are still working from home in 2024.

11
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In short, the latest statistics from this year show that 98% of all workers want all the possibilities of remote work, while this opportunity offers only 16% of the company. Almost half are those who would be prepared to leave the service if we were able to remove remote work.

12
00:03:36,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Workers from home or abroad are also very satisfied. About half are fully prepared to accept a lower salary just to be able to continue working from home. So let's first talk about that. How do you see, how did you experience these trends, also with the help of, of course, remote workers, and what could they be like as individuals and companies as well?

13
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, very good insight. I started to accept this trend around 2015, and it went up and up, until some smart companies started to use the opportunity of remote work as a way to attract interesting people.

14
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They were able to draw out a local talent pool, and then they started to realize that this is a new opportunity to get a top position in the company.

15
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In 2020, there was a complete black swan moment, where everything was put on the table, and there was a crazy amount of remote work. It was like we were giving a theme, and we all wanted to see more remote work, so we gave some rocket boosters, and it flew up.

16
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Of course, this was also followed by the crash of 2021, when we were still working in a pandemic standard, we saw a lot of hiring and parties like there's no tomorrow.

17
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, I agree with what you're saying, because there were a lot of cut rounds, money was flying everywhere. Yes, I think that 2022 was a bit of a shock to the market, but in addition to that, 80% of the companies went back to on-site.

18
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, but there are still a lot of them. If we look at the global scale, it would be impossible to go to the current scale, and I think that over time we see that these trends are also maintained.

19
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Some companies are trying to mitigate this with a hybrid mode of work, but because of what you just mentioned, 98% of people want to work, or at least have the opportunity to work remotely.

20
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This doesn't mean that 98% of people want to work completely remotely, but they want to have one day or two days a week, maybe even five, to work from home.

21
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Is there a difference between working remotely, working from home, and a hybrid system? Is there a big difference between working remotely and working from home?

22
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, working remotely means that you are not in the office, or you are not working on-site, but in the company, which means that you can also go to the co-working space.

23
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can also work on the beach, as a TikTok guru would say, if you are close to the screen and you can't see anything up there. But working from home means that you are working from home, and that is also working remotely.

24
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What do people do? I think that both options are great, and it depends on what appeals to them. I know people who work remotely, and it is not possible for them to work from home.

25
00:07:44,000 --> 00:08:01,000
On the other hand, we have a hybrid approach, which also has some advantages, but if we simplify it, it means that we work remotely two to three times a week, and then go to the office twice.

26
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The ratio is different, I usually see it as 3-2, or 4-1, which means four from home and one day a week in the office. Some call it a mandatory Monday.

27
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It is a more liberal approach, and I think that it applies to the structure of complete remote work, and they do it once a week, no matter what. Just to see if you are still alive. I see everything on the screen, but I don't get what I'm saying.

28
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Should companies be organized differently, if they have a lot of employees who work from home, or remotely, or have a hybrid model of work?

29
00:08:43,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes, I think that remote work from home has been a blessing during the pandemic. I know it sounds heavy, but I'll try to explain why.

30
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Often, the structure of the company is the same as it is growing. When more than 20, 25, 30 people come together, they have to organize themselves, because communication doesn't work anymore.

31
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They have to create a structure, and some people don't do that either, because they are lazy, they come to the table, and then suddenly there's a crash, where everything goes to shit, and no one knows how to talk to no one, and then the processes start.

32
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Some companies don't do that, because they are lazy on-site, which means that you can just click on a change, and ask them again.

33
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Remote companies have to do it on day one, otherwise they practically disappear, or it's impossible for them to work effectively. Many of these companies have proven that this is a good thing.

34
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How do you work?

35
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How do I work? I do a hybrid work from home and work remotely. My remote company is fully distributed, we all work in the same country.

36
00:10:39,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Most of the communication is done via Async, which is synchronized, documented, or via communication channels such as Slack. I work three days a week from home, and two days in a dedicated co-working space.

37
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So you stay in the co-working space.

38
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's right. This is a phase that's been going on for the last two or three months, where I've come to the point where I need a bit of socialization, especially between meetings and so on, so I've said to myself, okay, once or twice a week, no rules, but on average, I go to the co-working space, then I change, I go to a meeting,

39
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I meet someone, either in the same field as me, or a friend, or someone else, and I strive for socialization, where maybe this negative aspect works from home, which people haven't seen before, and in this way I improve this social aspect.

40
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What do you mean by that? Are there any other negative aspects of working from home or working remotely?

41
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes, there are, of course. As a disclaimer, I would say that there are a lot more pluses than minuses.

42
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But there are also minuses. Depending on the organization, for example, one of the negative aspects is that people are hard to get along with.

43
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This happens from time to time, but this is again an anomaly of the company.

44
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The second negative aspect is the lack of social aspect, because a specific company, for example a technical staff, does a lot on its own, i.e. individually, and there is a lack of socialization, and then some people forget about it in the afternoon or in the evening, and then it can happen that they feel a little lonely.

45
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So this is a part that has a lack.

46
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This person-to-person interaction with people in real life is very important.

47
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think it's very good how they solve this, that is, to organize a team meeting once every three months for a week, and then they meet in the evening, and this part is, for example, very important, very productive, and a lot of people say that this is a sweet spot.

48
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Once every three months, you get your core team, with whom you work for five days in real life, brainstorm, debate, or plan, this part is perhaps a little better in real life than remote.

49
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So yes, these three things, I would say, are among the most important.

50
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, with us, the synthesis is once in a while like this, that every three months, not even for five days, but usually for two to three, we get it, usually it's for planning, brainstorming, i.e. daily, for some retro, and for a team meeting.

51
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
which is much more convenient with ten people in the room than with ten people on Zoom.

52
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But, more than anything, when you change negative things, where can you change positive things.

53
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And maybe as a personal experience, for me, working from home primarily means that I have a career.

54
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I am from Ankara, and the perspective in Slovenia, if you are not in Ljubljana, is still a career,

55
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but it is really an incredible environment in Ankara to live and raise children.

56
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So, for me, it really means that I can involve my parents, that I can live with a grandmother who has dementia,

57
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and if she needs anything, in a short time, I really have a career.

58
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Recently, I also advanced in the leadership of a company.

59
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The funny thing is that the whole team in London, which sits on the side of the founders,

60
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and only I am here, 20 km away, was not convinced.

61
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So, that seems to me to be such an advantage, when you have already made this difference,

62
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
your league versus the NBA.

63
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you were to share your experience, where else do you see the advantages of working from home?

64
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I think that this is probably the biggest advantage I would make.

65
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If we look at it on a global scale, people have certain desires or ambitions to do something.

66
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Certain people do, certain people don't.

67
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This is not so important, but it is important that people who want to do something,

68
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
their potential surrounds them.

69
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
In the past, it was also the case that you simply had to move somewhere,

70
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
to be able to do some things.

71
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The industry still holds this, and this is the reality of the world.

72
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
In the tech space, this is not necessary.

73
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In other words, it should not be necessary.

74
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Looking at the demand, how much engineers are needed and increased in the market,

75
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
maybe a disclaimer, if GPT does not take over the market,

76
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
there is still a big shortage of engineers.

77
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What I wanted to say is that once you have the opportunity to work for a top company,

78
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
you will be good at something.

79
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It is not necessary to talk about top 3% or top 1%.

80
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is also nice, of course, for these people, the service,

81
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and also for people who simply cannot find a job in the local environment.

82
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
For someone from Ljubljana, it may be easier to find a job.

83
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
For someone who comes from Slovenia, they have a very limited pool of employees,

84
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and they have to move either to another place or somewhere else,

85
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and it takes a lot of time.

86
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Or it is not an opportunity for someone who is specifically targeted

87
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and is very good at something.

88
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And this is what prevents people from going back.

89
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
In addition, a side thing that is also important is the possibility of a higher salary,

90
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
if you work for this market.

91
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is of course also true.

92
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The third thing is, maybe even before that,

93
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I said this more in terms of a side salary,

94
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
it is nice, but the third is a huge increase in time.

95
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
People do not realize that there is a very simple statistic

96
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that says that if you work every day for two hours to get to the office,

97
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
or one hour to the office and one hour back,

98
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
this is the equivalent of a 40-hour employee in one month.

99
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That is, in four months, you survive one month of your employee in the commute.

100
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And this is such a time drain, I have no other expression in Slovenian,

101
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
how much time is lost for this.

102
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That is why the simple question is,

103
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
do you want the opportunity to work from home?

104
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes, of course.

105
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Because yes, some people like it,

106
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but only a small percentage like it once a week to work.

107
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Most of the time it is sitting in the car,

108
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
waiting either on the train or on the bus,

109
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and waiting, waiting, waiting to get somewhere to work,

110
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
where you will probably have 15 minutes of interaction with someone,

111
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and then go home.

112
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You can also do this online through other channels.

113
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, this is also what we may be a little quick to notice,

114
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
what we start, especially in a hybrid setting,

115
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
what we start, who we are in the office.

116
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
If we come to the office to sit on Zoom,

117
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
you ask yourself again why and what for.

118
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
On the other hand, we all know that this human-to-human thing is really needed.

119
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
For some things you need people in the office.

120
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, especially brainstorming.

121
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's not just talk about all the good things,

122
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
remote work is the best.

123
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Brainstorming is by far better in person than online.

124
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This is a fact.

125
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think we'll have to wait a long time for this to change,

126
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
so we can get closer to it.

127
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But you don't plan every day.

128
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You don't brainstorm every day in a new project or feature you build.

129
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You do this maybe once a month,

130
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
for three months,

131
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
possibly once a week, but not more than that.

132
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The rest of the interaction is very close to what you can do in person.

133
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because of that, in this example,

134
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I see an opportunity to get more experience,

135
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
because you plan things.

136
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The other part is the work itself.

137
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You allow yourself to be a top fit for your position.

138
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
For me personally, it's quite stressful.

139
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Maybe because I go in such an order,

140
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and then everyone wants to greet me.

141
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Of course.

142
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's logical.

143
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I only go once in three months.

144
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But above all, this instinct helps me.

145
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
For me personally, it feels like I'm organized at home,

146
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I know when I do what I have to do,

147
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
because it's not a job.

148
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But above all, I plan a good part of the day,

149
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
more than eight hours for the job.

150
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So I have some space in my head.

151
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
On the other hand,

152
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
when you don't know how to work from home,

153
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and you can't get into the hyper-focus at home,

154
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and you go outside all the time,

155
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
maybe that's why you're not as effective at home.

156
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's where the stereotypes come from.

157
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Working from home means you want to stay at home,

158
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
so you can get surgery, wash up, and so on.

159
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But when you work from home non-stop,

160
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
you just can't operate like that.

161
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
At the end of the day, you're stuck at home,

162
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and you have to show some results.

163
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you also experience that?

164
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Do you pay attention to your productivity,

165
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
whether you're at home or in the co-working space?

166
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Good question.

167
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I think we've entered an era of productivity porn,

168
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
where everyone is working non-stop,

169
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
but human brains don't work like that.

170
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We all have a peak,

171
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
where we get to two or three hours a day.

172
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The rest is still work,

173
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
less brain-intensive work.

174
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How do I manage that?

175
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
First, I try to do the most important tasks in the morning.

176
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Then, when I have low brain energy,

177
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I do tasks that don't require a lot of mental load.

178
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Of course, that also changes.

179
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
In the morning, when I fall asleep,

180
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I do tasks like that.

181
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It all depends on the person,

182
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and on our nature.

183
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But when I see that I'm not as productive,

184
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I go to the office or co-working space.

185
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It also depends on the person.

186
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
In my most productive environment,

187
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
it's the plane or the train.

188
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm hyper-productive.

189
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's a funny thing,

190
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
because I'm ready to deal with other people like that.

191
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I think it's normal, I'm a weirdo.

192
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But that doesn't mean I'm going to fly every day.

193
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I want to say that people have to find their own space,

194
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and find the most productive ones.

195
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I wanted to add something about productivity.

196
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
People from home, and the idea that people don't work.

197
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It all depends on the organization.

198
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
How do you measure productivity?

199
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
One thing that I think Mouthworks is changing,

200
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and it's very important,

201
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and more organizations should do it,

202
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
when we talk about the creative or tech industries,

203
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
maybe not creative, but more intellectual industries,

204
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
we shouldn't measure the time we live,

205
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
what we do,

206
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
but the impact of what we do.

207
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
People often ask me,

208
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
how can you work remotely,

209
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
how do you know someone is working remotely?

210
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I don't look if someone is online,

211
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
we don't have that either.

212
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We have a rule,

213
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that if someone is online,

214
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't care if they work from 3am or 10am.

215
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It doesn't mean they have to work from 3am.

216
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's up to them.

217
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The question is, do I know who did what today?

218
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Probably not.

219
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But do I know who did their work in one week?

220
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I definitely know that.

221
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So, when it comes to remote work, we just have to start measuring things differently.

222
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Not on a daily basis, but on a hourly basis.

223
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because presence doesn't mean work.

224
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But, for example, I do this in the weekly part,

225
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
where we look at our goals, what we did and what we didn't do.

226
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And very quickly we see that if this happens again,

227
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
then we have some difficulties.

228
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Either we plan poorly, or no one fulfills their tasks.

229
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
At the beginning, you also touched on the technological boom,

230
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
which was a bit of a success in 2022.

231
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
150,000 people were released only in the ZDA, in the technological sector.

232
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Meta, for example, released 11,000 people in October 2020,

233
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
which is about 13% of all those who participated in Meta.

234
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This year, Amazon announced and also increased the number of employees by 18,000.

235
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
In Europe, it was a bit smaller.

236
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
We have different laws here.

237
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And, in the end, maybe a bit more predictable business practices than in the ZDA.

238
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But we came to about 92,000 employees who remained without a job.

239
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Some countries were a bit more on the attack,

240
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
especially those that had more actors, such as SAP, Siemens, etc.

241
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
which are due to a decrease in expenses.

242
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Even in Slovenia, we did not get rid of the release.

243
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We also caught up with some businesses at that time,

244
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
which were on our market for quite some time.

245
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
However, these releases were not entirely evenly distributed.

246
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Some sectors, such as e-commerce and social media,

247
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
which have experienced a lot of growth during the pandemic,

248
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
have also recorded a lot of release when growth slowed down.

249
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
On the other hand, there are companies for cyber security,

250
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and of course we must not forget AI and machine learning.

251
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
In fact, after the questioning, the number of employees increased by 30%

252
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
among those professionals.

253
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So, the releases were not equally distributed.

254
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Perhaps, as a recruiter, a lot of recruiters were released.

255
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
There were also a lot of engineers,

256
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and all of us who were involved in the work environment,

257
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
such as product QA and so on.

258
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
However, the increase in talent was a powerful factor in all of these.

259
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Because, of course, when you release someone first,

260
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
when you want to hire more people, you hire more people.

261
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So, if you can relate a little to this,

262
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
also from your field, when it comes to services.

263
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
How did you find out about it?

264
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Did you notice any difference before 2022,

265
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
2022 and 2023, also in the questioning,

266
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and in general, how did you feel about these trends?

267
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes, interesting question.

268
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I would go back a little more to 2020,

269
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
where we saw some April-May,

270
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I think there was also a massive layoff,

271
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
because people were afraid of what was going to happen.

272
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Then there was an abnormal influx, or growth.

273
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
In general, as you said, in social media and e-commerce,

274
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
the business did not record a 10% growth.

275
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Some went as far as 3x, 4x, 10x.

276
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Unusual numbers occurred in this space.

277
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Today, I will talk about how Meta had massive layoffs,

278
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and so did Amazon.

279
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I would say that everything, and how it started,

280
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
end of tech, as we know it.

281
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I would put it this way,

282
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I have prepared a very interesting article on this topic,

283
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
people shouldn't look at how many businesses had massive layoffs,

284
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
people in the last 2-2.2, or 2-2.9, even more.

285
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You will see that all those businesses had less employees,

286
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
than they have now.

287
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The growth in 2.21 was such an anomaly,

288
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and so much FOMO happened on the market,

289
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
that everyone went over the top.

290
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Then the layoff came.

291
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
2.22 was the layoff.

292
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We read about it.

293
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It was around the second quarter,

294
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
it started, then there was a winter,

295
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
if it was summer for us,

296
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
but in recruiting it was winter.

297
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
In the whole American world,

298
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because we work with American clients,

299
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
it was zero.

300
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Now I would say that over time,

301
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
in the last few months,

302
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
2.23 started to stabilize,

303
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and now it is growing again.

304
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Slowly,

305
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but so that,

306
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
when I talk to people in our space,

307
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
we all feel that it started to grow slowly again.

308
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Because the layoff was really bad,

309
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
a lot of recruiters lost their jobs,

310
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
a lot of companies didn't want to hire,

311
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
they optimized their businesses,

312
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
those that were successful,

313
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
then they said,

314
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
ok, we are doing well for a while,

315
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
now we need people.

316
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Let's put aside the whole AI tech space,

317
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
where there was a big boom,

318
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and I think it is a new industry,

319
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
where there will be a lot of services,

320
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and we will see how it will develop.

321
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
There is definitely a lot of interest in this field,

322
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
so here we see a huge growth,

323
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
people looking for experience working with AI.

324
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Cyber security is also there,

325
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and other more popular positions,

326
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
from PMs to back-end engineers, front-end engineers.

327
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We are slowly seeing a growth.

328
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I think we have already seen it with Bot.

329
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
From your words, I am really happy.

330
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
As they say,

331
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
for this crowd,

332
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the Podcast of Grodno,

333
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
we all want the best.

334
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I am in AI,

335
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and I am doing a chat GPT-R,

336
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
after December,

337
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and at the beginning of the summer.

338
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It is really incredible,

339
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
how this chat GPT-R has affected all of us in this industry,

340
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and our product zone is much bigger than it was in chat GPT-R.

341
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It is really incredible.

342
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You are on a spaceship with a rocket booster,

343
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
which is almost anomalous,

344
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but the space is really growing,

345
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and as you said,

346
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
it is becoming more popular.

347
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I am going to a recreation with a colleague,

348
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and I see a hairdresser,

349
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
who is telling me,

350
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
that this is a chat GPT-R.

351
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Then we know,

352
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that there is a lot of demand,

353
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and a lot of things are going to happen.

354
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Everything is great.

355
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Maybe we can connect to chat GPT-R,

356
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
for the next question.

357
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Let's talk a little bit,

358
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
about how to find a job in the future.

359
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
A chat GPT-R can help us here,

360
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
but maybe,

361
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
if we start at the beginning,

362
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
or at the beginning of this,

363
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
what are the differences,

364
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
between looking for a job on a local level,

365
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and looking for a job in the future?

366
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
In theory, there are no differences.

367
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
In practice,

368
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
in my opinion,

369
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I would say,

370
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
that there is a huge difference,

371
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and this difference,

372
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
in the end,

373
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
is seen,

374
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
as a very important factor.

375
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And this factor is,

376
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
if,

377
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I will try to give an analogy,

378
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
which also applies to the job,

379
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
if a Slovenian job is looking for,

380
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
a DevOps engineer,

381
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
with 5 years of experience,

382
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
if I'm not mistaken.

383
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
In reality,

384
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
he catches his fish,

385
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
in some small fishery.

386
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
For example,

387
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
if he works locally.

388
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
If he works remotely,

389
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
he has an ocean in front of him.

390
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And this is the difference.

391
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Now, if you are looking for a job locally,

392
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
everyone catches a fish in a fishery.

393
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Differently in the ocean.

394
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Now, I won't scare anyone,

395
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
because this means,

396
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
that if you are competing,

397
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
for example,

398
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
on a job with 500 applicants,

399
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and this is a very big reality,

400
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
is that someone,

401
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
who prepares properly,

402
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and invests some energy,

403
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and work in preparation,

404
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
has a good qualification,

405
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
will always be a top 5% candidate.

406
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Let's start.

407
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What are the first steps,

408
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
that must be taken,

409
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
when you finally realize,

410
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
that you want to work remotely.

411
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There is a lot of conservativeness,

412
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
on the Slovenian market.

413
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Not so much for the job,

414
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
as for the job for Tui,

415
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and Tui's business,

416
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and playing in the NBA.

417
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You are so comfortable,

418
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
in the local league.

419
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So, what are the first steps,

420
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that must be taken?

421
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Definitely,

422
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
if I start with an actionable point,

423
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I would say,

424
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
that in the last couple of years,

425
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
we have been struggling a lot,

426
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and there have been offers,

427
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that came to us,

428
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
from a lot of experts,

429
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
who never looked for a job.

430
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Now, they have reached the point,

431
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
where the company has dried up,

432
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and no one has to apply for a job.

433
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I have never applied for a job,

434
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and here I would say,

435
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
that everyone should realize,

436
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that this is not something,

437
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
where you click on LinkedIn,

438
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
easy to apply,

439
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
because, as I would say,

440
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
for a job at this level,

441
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it doesn't work like that,

442
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
completely remote.

443
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We have to prepare,

444
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
we have to update our CV,

445
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
we have to describe the things,

446
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
that we have done,

447
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and be very hands-on.

448
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
We have to show,

449
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
what kind of impact,

450
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
we have added in the past,

451
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and show how we match,

452
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
to some of these jobs.

453
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I would say,

454
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that if someone,

455
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
wants to get a good job,

456
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
but doesn't have a triple A resume,

457
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
or a background,

458
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
in the sense,

459
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that works for Mera,

460
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
or X,

461
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
or some other,

462
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
fang-mang type of companies,

463
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I would say,

464
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
that this is a part-time project.

465
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Two hours a day,

466
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
or a couple of hours a week,

467
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
dedicated to,

468
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
applying for a job,

469
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
writing a good CV,

470
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
sending an email,

471
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and potentially doing something extra,

472
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
to get an interview.

473
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
If we look at it globally,

474
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the biggest challenge,

475
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
for the candidates,

476
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
that we work with,

477
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
is to say,

478
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I applied for 10 jobs,

479
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and no one called me back,

480
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and I qualified.

481
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You have to know,

482
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
that on the other side,

483
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
there is Sarah,

484
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and you can't expect,

485
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
from someone else,

486
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
that they will get 500 quality jobs.

487
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Our most important part,

488
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
is to figure out,

489
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
how we are going to get out,

490
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
of the noise,

491
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
that is created by the applicants.

492
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That was my next question,

493
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
what can someone do,

494
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
to increase their opportunities,

495
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
for a job.

496
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Or,

497
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I think the first step,

498
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
in the first interview,

499
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
is to call someone,

500
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and ask them to send you a positive message.

501
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Not a generic,

502
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
rejection message.

503
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That is a great question.

504
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Some of the things,

505
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that I will say,

506
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
might seem controversial,

507
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
but,

508
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I will try to be transparent,

509
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
about what I would do,

510
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and what some candidates do.

511
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Most of the time,

512
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
they are very positive.

513
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
First of all,

514
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
as we said,

515
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
we are talking about,

516
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
our impact,

517
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and the value,

518
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
that we added to the company,

519
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
not the responsibilities,

520
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
that we had.

521
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't know,

522
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
if you are a devops engineer,

523
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
migrating structures,

524
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
saving thousands of dollars,

525
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
per month,

526
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
or,

527
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
launching a feature,

528
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that had so many users,

529
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
etc.

530
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
If I may,

531
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
we are working in teams,

532
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
right?

533
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes,

534
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I would like you to know,

535
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that you get your CV,

536
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
from the company,

537
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and not from the team.

538
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yes,

539
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I did that for my team,

540
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and it is fair enough.

541
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I know,

542
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
it is hard to quantify them,

543
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but,

544
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
sometimes it works,

545
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and sometimes it doesn't.

546
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That is one thing,

547
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
but,

548
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I think,

549
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
one of the most important things,

550
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
is to try,

551
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to step it up.

552
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
For example,

553
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
there is a hot,

554
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
remote work company,

555
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
that has been building,

556
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
their brand,

557
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
since 2015.

558
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
They got 2,000 applications,

559
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
for an engineer,

560
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I met the engineer,

561
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
he was underqualified,

562
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
but there was a difference,

563
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
in his application,

564
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
from the other 2,000 people.

565
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
He went extra mile.

566
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
He took the project,

567
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and the CV,

568
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
that is a bit extreme,

569
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
he made it look like their app,

570
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
visually,

571
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and that impressed a lot of people,

572
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and that was the first interview.

573
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But when he went extra mile,

574
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and the recruiters said that,

575
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and the people he talked to,

576
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
he used the app,

577
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
he was a user,

578
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
he reported some bugs,

579
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
that he had on his application,

580
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and that added,

581
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
added some value,

582
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
they realized,

583
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
that someone put in the effort,

584
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and showed interest,

585
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
that they really want to work here.

586
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That doesn't mean,

587
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
that developers have to beg,

588
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
for someone to work here,

589
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
but just to show interest,

590
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and energy,

591
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
to come to the call,

592
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to ask a question,

593
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
what do you do,

594
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
to get interested,

595
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and on the third day,

596
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
you will experience the next year,

597
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
two, five, something,

598
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and you have no question,

599
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
where you will be,

600
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
what you will do,

601
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
to show interest,

602
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
that is huge,

603
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and to show your skill.

604
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Today, for some companies,

605
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
unfortunately,

606
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
the CV is not enough,

607
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
if someone writes,

608
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
one thing,

609
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
for example,

610
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
home tasks,

611
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
or live coding,

612
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
this part,

613
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
can be skipped,

614
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
if someone documents

615
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
their side projects,

616
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
on github,

617
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
this is,

618
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
sometimes,

619
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
a very positive signal,

620
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
that works well,

621
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
for companies,

622
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and also for candidates,

623
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to decide,

624
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
if they will move forward,

625
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
or not,

626
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
not a complete thing,

627
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
but an additional signal,

628
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
will save candidates,

629
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and time,

630
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
because no one wants to

631
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
waste time,

632
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
in a conversation,

633
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
that does not lead anywhere,

634
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and this is often

635
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
recruiting,

636
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
preparing fit,

637
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
but,

638
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
most of all,

639
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
correct me,

640
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
most of all,

641
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
it pays off,

642
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to choose 10 companies,

643
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
and prepare quality,

644
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and really look,

645
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and apply,

646
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
where you really want to work,

647
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
like in a numbers game.

648
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
If the question is meant,

649
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
to those people,

650
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
who are making a step up in their career,

651
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and at the end of the day,

652
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
it's not just a paycheck,

653
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
that they are looking at,

654
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I would say, absolutely, yes.

655
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Apply to 10 companies,

656
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and prepare,

657
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
maybe look at their app,

658
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
report if you find something,

659
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
or, I don't know,

660
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
add,

661
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
add a disclaimer,

662
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that you are working on a project,

663
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
on a similar topic,

664
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
where you will,

665
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I would say,

666
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
you will get a really good offer,

667
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
from one of those 10 companies,

668
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
which is often frustrating,

669
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and where I see,

670
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
developers lose motivation,

671
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
to apply for 1, 2, 3 jobs,

672
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
they don't hear anything back,

673
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
until they get an auto-rejection mail,

674
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and then it's like,

675
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
oh, maybe I'm not fit,

676
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and it's some kind of imposter syndrome,

677
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and all of a sudden,

678
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'll tell you this,

679
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
if we are talking about a remote work space,

680
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
for a really good company,

681
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
fast growing,

682
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
where you know there is a lot of competition,

683
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and a lot of interest,

684
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
if you don't apply for such a company,

685
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
then in less than 10 applications,

686
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
there will be a service,

687
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
called LuckySide,

688
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and,

689
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I want to say,

690
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
it's worth taking time,

691
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and dedicate yourself,

692
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
because every application,

693
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
1, 2, 5,

694
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
will result in you being

695
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
in the top 5% of applicants,

696
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and you will most likely get,

697
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
if you are qualified,

698
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
a job on an interview,

699
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and then they lie to you,

700
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
because it's their game,

701
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
but that part is the hardest,

702
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
and I see that most people fail,

703
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
because most of the technical staff,

704
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
has a lack,

705
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and it's the biggest improvement,

706
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
to come to the first interview.

707
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
How did the motivational letter,

708
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
finally die?

709
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That's a very interesting question,

710
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I would say,

711
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
yes and no.

712
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Now I will try to explain,

713
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
why yes and no.

714
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
In the way we see them today,

715
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
yes,

716
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
in the way

717
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
they can be done,

718
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
no.

719
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Today, it's not a cover letter,

720
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
where you can write,

721
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
how to apply,

722
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and why you should work here,

723
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
it's a motivational letter,

724
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
where you look at the app,

725
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and maybe report 2 or 3 bugs,

726
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
find an improvement,

727
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
maybe you fixed something,

728
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and show it on your report,

729
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
look at this,

730
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I really like what you are doing,

731
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and you should apply for this job.

732
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
That's a cover letter today.

733
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And that's definitely,

734
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
one of those things,

735
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
that prevents you,

736
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
absolutely.

737
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I think that,

738
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
if you apply to such a place,

739
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and if someone sees this,

740
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and if you are qualified,

741
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I think there are very few possibilities,

742
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
of course there are,

743
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
but there are a lot of possibilities,

744
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
that you won't be invited to the interview.

745
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Because a lot,

746
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
500-1000 people apply,

747
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
but they don't do anything.

748
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You are one of maybe three,

749
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
who did something like that,

750
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and that engagement is very valuable,

751
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and it will buy you back,

752
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
a lot of times,

753
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
on the interview.

754
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So, you are young,

755
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
you know what you want,

756
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
but it's pretty clear,

757
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
in what,

758
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
we are already in a previous episode,

759
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
the first part,

760
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
thinking about what we really want,

761
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
is also very important,

762
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
so that we don't

763
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
spread our network too much.

764
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But,

765
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
where to find,

766
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
where to find,

767
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
job vacancies,

768
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
job vacancies,

769
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
are there any platforms,

770
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
where do we have that step in the profile,

771
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
first of all,

772
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
looking for those opportunities.

773
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Remote, of course,

774
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
we click on remote,

775
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
is there anything else,

776
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
where else can we find jobs?

777
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yes, of course,

778
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
remote is just one of many platforms,

779
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
where we specifically work on matchmaking,

780
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and we are a recruiter.

781
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
There are some outsourcing opportunities,

782
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
for example,

783
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
where you work more freelance projects,

784
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
like Toptail.

785
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Now, if we look at some

786
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
job vacancies,

787
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
there are some

788
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
job boards,

789
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
where you pay to look,

790
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and in the end,

791
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
LinkedIn is not a bad idea,

792
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
but what I would say is that

793
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
if there is an opportunity,

794
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
if you find a job on LinkedIn,

795
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
you can apply on LinkedIn,

796
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
but you can also apply via e-mail,

797
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
go to their website, find an e-mail,

798
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and apply there.

799
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
If you apply a lot,

800
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you will probably have a little more

801
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
influx of applications

802
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
on e-mail,

803
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
than on LinkedIn.

804
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It depends.

805
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I mean,

806
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
in my ATS,

807
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
it comes through the same bracket,

808
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
only the source is then

809
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
applied on your website.

810
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yes, it depends on the scale of the company.

811
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Some have integration,

812
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
some don't,

813
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and then there is a lot of noise on LinkedIn.

814
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But I would say,

815
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
for example,

816
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
the job boards are

817
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
remote...

818
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
What did I forget?

819
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Remote OK, yes.

820
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Remote OK is one of those

821
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
where we work remotely.

822
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But yes, there are a lot of services

823
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
on those portals.

824
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
For example,

825
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
if you want to work with

826
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
an Austrian market,

827
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
on an Austrian local portal,

828
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think it will work with

829
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
an Austrian market.

830
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And then you log in,

831
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and you look at where the voice is written in English,

832
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and you apply to that voice.

833
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But you should know,

834
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
for example,

835
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
that all the most popular opportunities

836
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
from LinkedIn,

837
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Remote OK,

838
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
have the highest influx of applications.

839
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
There, as I said,

840
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
you will have to work a little harder,

841
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
sometimes even not.

842
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I would also add

843
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
that social...

844
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
social media here,

845
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Kliupo.se,

846
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
just any platform, whatever

847
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
someone uses, there are no rules here.

848
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
NX,

849
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Facebook,

850
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Slack,

851
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
finally Discord,

852
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and I will let myself

853
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
invite all

854
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
listeners here,

855
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
so that we can also

856
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
join on Discord, we have Discord in Grodje,

857
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I will also link at the bottom

858
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
of the video,

859
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
these are also great communities

860
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
for networking and joining services.

861
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Crypto, for example,

862
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
a specific market,

863
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
was very huge on the topic

864
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
of Discord community,

865
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
plus, for example, some Telegram groups,

866
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and you are already a member of that community,

867
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and there I got

868
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
some interesting people

869
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
who were involved in projects,

870
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
for example, Contributor Codes,

871
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
and so on, so yes, I forgot

872
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
to mention, social media is also

873
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
one of the phenomena

874
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
that I manage in Slovenia,

875
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
and I also think that I manage

876
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
in a few countries,

877
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
for example, a Slovenian group,

878
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Slovenian developers,

879
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
where there are a lot of services,

880
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
some interesting things,

881
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and it's almost like an anomaly,

882
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
you rarely see it in such a large group,

883
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
a large number of residents.

884
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So yes, prepare different channels,

885
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
then, as you said,

886
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
really see, aha,

887
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
this is something that I would really like to do,

888
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
and then devote

889
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
some energy and time to

890
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
apply for this model so that you will join.

891
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's like,

892
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I don't know,

893
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
it's not a promotion,

894
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
but really, sometimes we really change

895
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
someone's life,

896
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
in the sense that we also helped

897
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
someone who lives

898
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
in Bosnia, in a village

899
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
that has two hours of driving

900
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
to Sarajevo, where, for example,

901
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
a tech hub

902
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
works for a company

903
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
in San Francisco,

904
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
paid $160,000,

905
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
which is really good for what it does,

906
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and I couldn't have those opportunities.

907
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And it's not just about paying,

908
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
it's about having the opportunity

909
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
to work on top-notch projects

910
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
that otherwise

911
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I wouldn't have the opportunity to do.

912
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And that's why

913
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
you pay to try,

914
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
because you really have the opportunity to work

915
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
with very smart people

916
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and interesting people

917
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
who do the same thing, but are part of something else.

918
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yes, well,

919
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
as you said,

920
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and now that you mentioned it,

921
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
maybe another big difference is

922
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
especially in some such companies,

923
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
the relations are also

924
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
a little different.

925
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Working at an international level,

926
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
in an international team,

927
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
there must also be a slightly different rule,

928
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
because it seems to me that

929
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
this is a good school,

930
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
even if someone does not want

931
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
to work all their career in the future,

932
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
that it is an interesting

933
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
leap from a local,

934
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and perhaps also from

935
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
some Slovenian culture

936
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
in some places.

937
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I think it is certainly

938
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
an experience that you will not forget

939
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
or rich in some way because

940
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
you will work first with people

941
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
from different cultures,

942
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
you will learn different communication,

943
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
because you will have to respect some other standards.

944
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The way we communicate

945
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
may be different from people

946
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
who sit in England,

947
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
in America, or in Latin America.

948
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I often joke

949
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
when someone says

950
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
when an American

951
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
asks a Slovenian,

952
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
how do you think it's okay

953
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
if all Americans wear red flags,

954
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
what are they doing?

955
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I think it's okay,

956
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
in fact, it's very good for them.

957
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
When we learn some of these

958
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
communications,

959
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
they work with different cultures,

960
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
so it's definitely a rich experience.

961
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Plus, you can work with

962
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
very interesting people

963
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
who are good on their own front.

964
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You gave me a very nice source,

965
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and I'm looking forward to the next question.

966
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Communication

967
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and in general,

968
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
the first interview

969
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
is a video interview

970
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
on Zoom.

971
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Do you have a specific advice

972
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
on how to

973
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
hack this standard format

974
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
of interviews?

975
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I agree, I won't say

976
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
you have to do it in bed.

977
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
A little joke.

978
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I think it's a very important part

979
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
because we have a lack

980
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
of in-person interactions.

981
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
One of the things you have to know

982
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
is that people are very active

983
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
in these interviews,

984
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
especially if they like the job.

985
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I would recommend

986
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
all HR people

987
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
to be more relaxed

988
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and not make it

989
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
like an interrogation room.

990
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Unfortunately,

991
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
some companies don't always do that.

992
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
What I suggest to candidates

993
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
is

994
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
to

995
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
do a demo.

996
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
If they haven't done

997
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
any interview in three years,

998
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
it's a matter of practice.

999
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
In the end,

1000
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
ask your partner

1001
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
or colleague to do

1002
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
a mock interview.

1003
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
There are also platforms

1004
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
where you can do a mock interview

1005
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and get valuable information.

1006
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
They are very useful

1007
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
when you're working.

1008
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Unfortunately,

1009
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
in a limited setting

1010
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
in a 2D format,

1011
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
it can be a disadvantage

1012
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and won't help

1013
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
your promotion.

1014
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
On the other hand,

1015
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
we have a lot of people.

1016
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
As much as possible,

1017
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
set up an interaction

1018
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
with that person.

1019
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Because at the end of the day,

1020
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
it has to be an interaction

1021
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
on a high level,

1022
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
because everyone knows

1023
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
you're going to work with them.

1024
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
If you don't have practice,

1025
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
talk to someone

1026
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
or do a mock interview.

1027
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I think I've done

1028
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
around a thousand interviews

1029
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
in the past three years.

1030
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
In the first two or three minutes,

1031
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I can tell

1032
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
who was in the first,

1033
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
third or fifth interview.

1034
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
How are the people

1035
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and how do they prepare?

1036
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Often, it doesn't serve

1037
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
the people.

1038
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That's why I prefer

1039
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
to talk to someone

1040
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
before the interview.

1041
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
That way,

1042
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
you'll know how to respond.

1043
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
If someone on the other side

1044
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
of the interview

1045
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
deserves you,

1046
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
you might be a little nervous,

1047
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
but you'll be able

1048
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
to talk to them.

1049
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
On the other hand,

1050
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I see that the candidate

1051
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
might add

1052
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
that you can sit anywhere

1053
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and decide

1054
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
if you want to do

1055
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
the interview at home.

1056
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You have to be careful

1057
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
about the background,

1058
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
about the equipment,

1059
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
because that's also

1060
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
something we assess

1061
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
in the first interviews.

1062
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's important to know

1063
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
if the environment

1064
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
you're in is suitable

1065
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
for the interview.

1066
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You can really see

1067
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
what's going on.

1068
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I personally don't mind

1069
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
if someone has an interview

1070
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
in a car,

1071
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
because I know

1072
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that if they don't live in a car,

1073
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
they probably won't work there.

1074
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You can see that

1075
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
there's no proper equipment

1076
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
all the time.

1077
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
We didn't invest in a normal camera

1078
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
or headphones

1079
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
or microphone.

1080
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's also

1081
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
one of those things

1082
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
that affects the

1083
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
unconscious bias

1084
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
and leaves an additional impression

1085
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
on us

1086
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
who do the interview.

1087
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I think that's a great source.

1088
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You said that people

1089
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
are biased.

1090
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Your job, on the other hand,

1091
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
is to try to eliminate

1092
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
all the biases that may arise.

1093
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The fact that you don't have

1094
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
a camera at home

1095
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and that's why

1096
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
you're in the interview,

1097
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
is definitely

1098
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
HR bias.

1099
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I mean,

1100
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
that doesn't correlate

1101
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
with your quality of work,

1102
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
but it will correlate

1103
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
with the communication

1104
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
or style of communication

1105
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
that you have.

1106
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It's not necessary,

1107
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but it's a standard

1108
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
in today's remote setting.

1109
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
If you don't have a phone,

1110
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
download an app,

1111
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
change your phone

1112
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
and say,

1113
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
sorry, I don't have a camera,

1114
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
but you have a phone,

1115
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
it will show up.

1116
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
If you're driving

1117
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
from your on-site job

1118
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
to your job in the office,

1119
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
say, I'm sorry, but

1120
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
unfortunately, I'm driving home,

1121
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
and that's why I'm here.

1122
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
A context will help.

1123
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
The camera,

1124
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
and our head of security,

1125
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
have a video

1126
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
identification

1127
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
with pleasure.

1128
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
We know

1129
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
that the same person

1130
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
who shows up on the first call

1131
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
is also the same person

1132
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and we also record

1133
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
our interviews,

1134
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
so that we have

1135
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
a record

1136
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
with pleasure,

1137
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
because

1138
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
there's something

1139
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
going on on both sides.

1140
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yes, I agree,

1141
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
it's an interesting thing.

1142
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I say, no panic,

1143
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
you don't need the whole interview

1144
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
including the video,

1145
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
but

1146
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the first video

1147
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
identification, even if

1148
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
someone in the same Zoom room

1149
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
comes over the phone,

1150
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
because he doesn't have a camera.

1151
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yes, of course.

1152
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You have to take it differently.

1153
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Why is the camera important?

1154
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Because you can see

1155
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
who you're talking to on the other side.

1156
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's a base.

1157
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Should we be 60 minutes on the call?

1158
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
No, if it's a bad connection,

1159
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
just wave twice

1160
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and that's it,

1161
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
if it doesn't go differently.

1162
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So, this brings us

1163
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
to the last question,

1164
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
which will be

1165
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
touched a little,

1166
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and if it concludes

1167
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
for the rest of the search,

1168
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
a lot of people

1169
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
who are fake

1170
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
or who are not

1171
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
what they seem to be,

1172
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
they have their profiles

1173
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
on LinkedIn,

1174
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
the whole portfolio is

1175
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
made up,

1176
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
you can see that

1177
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
everything doesn't match,

1178
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and it's not

1179
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
what it used to be.

1180
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
On the other hand,

1181
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
we also have fake businesses,

1182
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
fake services,

1183
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so

1184
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
can you give us

1185
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
an idea of what we need to be aware of

1186
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and how we can

1187
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
protect ourselves from this?

1188
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I would say that

1189
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
it's easiest to protect yourself

1190
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
from this with a healthy brain.

1191
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
If someone offers you

1192
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
a service for 10,000 dollars

1193
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
per month

1194
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
for 4 hours of work,

1195
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and it doesn't correlate

1196
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
with your hourly rate,

1197
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
and you'll have to pay

1198
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in advance for someone to offer you something,

1199
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
then it's probably not

1200
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
the right thing.

1201
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Nothing comes for free.

1202
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
If it's too good to be true,

1203
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
then it's probably not.

1204
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
In the other context,

1205
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
in today's era,

1206
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
it's a very interesting thing

1207
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
to understand

1208
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
who is on the other side,

1209
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
because sometimes people

1210
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
change, we've already had

1211
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
an experience with this,

1212
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
and then we sort of turned it

1213
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
around.

1214
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
There were doubts

1215
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
whether it was done by this person

1216
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
or someone else.

1217
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Today, we've come to the era

1218
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
where people have changed

1219
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and said,

1220
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
ah, live coding,

1221
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
which has its own specifics,

1222
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and people have to prepare for it,

1223
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
because we don't code

1224
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
in an environment where

1225
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
these three people are watching.

1226
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Maybe friends,

1227
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
but it's not the same setup.

1228
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So it's very biased,

1229
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
so people prepare for it.

1230
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But even here,

1231
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
we've moved to a place

1232
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
where there's a chat GPT

1233
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and it helps us solve

1234
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
certain things.

1235
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So it's a way of figuring out

1236
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
how this part of the technical

1237
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
evaluation is solved.

1238
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
One of the very interesting

1239
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
things I learned,

1240
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and maybe you can find a link

1241
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
in the description,

1242
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
is that it works like a review.

1243
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You talk in code.

1244
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
No coding, but we talk,

1245
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and together we go through the code.

1246
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And here, it's hard to use

1247
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
a chat GPT if you're on the spot

1248
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
talking about something.

1249
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And that helps in some discussions

1250
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
to see if something is being read

1251
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
or used. But yeah, common sense.

1252
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Look if the picture looks the same,

1253
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
or not.

1254
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
If it's a different person,

1255
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I don't know.

1256
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But yeah, try to identify

1257
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
and if someone sent you

1258
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
something that looks too good

1259
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
to be true for their level,

1260
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
go back to the interview

1261
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
and talk again, and see.

1262
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Because if it's someone

1263
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
who's technical,

1264
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and works with it,

1265
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'll get the feeling very quickly.

1266
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Is it really someone who did it,

1267
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and why did they decide to do it?

1268
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Or was it done by

1269
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
some other person?

1270
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So, we've come to the end

1271
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
of this episode of Zagora.

1272
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
With you were

1273
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Saravšine Gašper

1274
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
and Andrej Fodor.

1275
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Andrej, thank you very much.

1276
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I think we've covered

1277
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
a lot of important questions.

1278
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And I hope

1279
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
that we'll have more

1280
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
opportunities to work together

1281
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
as a result of this conversation.

1282
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
We can't conclude

1283
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
without mentioning

1284
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Human Frog and 3FSA.

1285
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Thank you

1286
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
for the sponsorship

1287
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
so that we can

1288
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
have the awards.

1289
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And of course, our Patreons.

1290
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Without them,

1291
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
our Discord

1292
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
would be much longer.

1293
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And of course,

1294
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
the awards teams

1295
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Otto Brgles, Andraž Straka,

1296
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Jan Dolar and Tomaš Zaman.

1297
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We're with you

1298
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
and we're doing this

1299
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
with joy.

1300
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
With joy, right?

1301
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Thank you

1302
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
and see you next time.
