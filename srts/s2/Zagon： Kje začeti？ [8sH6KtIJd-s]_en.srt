00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, good day. In the second episode of Zagona, my name is Saravšina Gašpar, for those of you who don't know me yet.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today I have two guests with me. First of all, Islam Musić, who has been teaching for almost 20 years and works as a professor at high school and high school.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He is also very active in our group, and above all, he is also a mentor to students, students and startups.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, everything is for girls.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You also have your own program for young people, SkillUp Mentor, which we will talk a little more about later.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But one of the students or the success of this program is also Ilija, who joined us.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ilija Tomić, hello to you too.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You graduated from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maribor last September.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And on the topic of full stack development of applications with two different approaches.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I also took the SkillUp project for writing my master's thesis.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's right, because you joined the program as soon as you entered the studio.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And now, if I'm not mistaken, Glih was your first job, because you graduated in a good month.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So it's still honeymoon period, right?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, that's right.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We will also talk about this a little later.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Today, I imagined this conversation in two parts.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
First, we will touch a little on learning.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So where and how to start learning.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Then a little more about looking for first employees.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I also hope that you will tell us a little about what it is like to be a junior at the market.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Maybe we'll start with learning.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, right at the beginning, with summer.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When can we start learning?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm interested in when ...

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Maybe we'll start with Ilija.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
When did you start learning and first met computers?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
In high school, at Islam.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I started in the first or second year of high school.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I started with the initial programming.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I started with diagrams, basic things.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then, step by step, I've been doing it for 14 years.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did you have any interest in elementary school before?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Before, I didn't program anything.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I had an interest in computers, in technology.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I didn't program anything myself.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Islam, you also have children, a little older.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Did you teach them everything?

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The two older girls are not so much for technology.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The younger ones, yes.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When did you start and how did you start?

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My son will be 14 years old this year.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think we are young.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We started, we showed him.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Also, what Ilija said at the beginning.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It is not necessary to have such a story.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It is also very dependent on yourself.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We have different experiences.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm talking from school.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
For example, a student in the second grade,

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
when he first starts programming,

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
he breaks his head.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
At the end of the third or fourth grade,

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
he becomes one of our better students.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I wouldn't be so sure now

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
what happens to the brain, synapses.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But something definitely happens at that moment.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It changes.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't have much pressure on my children.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course, if they want,

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
they have my full support.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But also those who listen.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It is not necessary to start with some top sport

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
when you are 8 years old.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It can be good enough later.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But as Ilija said,

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
interest is interesting.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That is the main thing.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If not, everything else will suffer.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We have quite a good experience in our company.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We started with a 5-year-old,

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
when he was 4 years old,

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
with some basic tasks,

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
such as coding,

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
when he has this programming logic

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
through games,

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and Minecraft, for example.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But it seems to me that

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
we have a lot of experience

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
in our company.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We have a lot of experience

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in our company.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But it seems to me that

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
what we have prepared

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
is the difference

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
between having him

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
sit at the computer,

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
giving him a mouse,

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
giving him coordination,

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
getting to know the computer.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It seems to me that today

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
there are a lot of children

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
mostly on tablets,

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
on phones,

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
which are a bit more,

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
let's say,

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
a computer.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Some idea.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know,

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
when I was in elementary school,

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we didn't have,

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not that old yet,

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
but there were no tablets,

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
so the first experience

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
was with a computer,

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
with a mouse,

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
with a sniper,

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and also with a console.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know what that experience is like.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think that what has changed

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is that when there will be

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
a child on Minecraft,

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the players will demand

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
a bit more processor power,

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
or whatever it is,

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
because mine was also on a tablet.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But again, maybe this

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
interest and interest,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and Minecraft,

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
if I take it as an example,

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I also need to go there,

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and I would say that

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
this coordination with the mouse

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is very important.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes, that's true.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
OK.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's move on to

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the overall education

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
in the school system.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A short while ago,

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we had a guest

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
from the Ministry of Digital Education

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
in our garden,

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
who also touched

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
on the importance of

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
digital literacy.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
At the beginning of this month,

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
the Ministry of Education

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
also prepared a letter

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
requesting the introduction

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
of a mandatory subject,

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
computer science and computer science,

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in all primary and secondary schools.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I would be interested,

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
maybe, Ilja,

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
if we start with you.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You went to a technical secondary school,

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but maybe you made a mistake

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in computer science and computer science

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
in the primary school.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What are your experiences

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
with these two subjects

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
in the primary school?

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In the primary school,

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
we had 8th and 9th grade,

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think, in computer science.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The subject was once a week,

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
for one hour.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When we changed the mouse

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
at the end,

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the teachers showed

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
an award,

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think,

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but that was in the first 15 minutes,

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
then we had a break,

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and we were students,

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so I think we were most excited

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
about that subject,

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
when we saw the whole class

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
going to play games.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That was the start,

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think.

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I would talk about it.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In the secondary school,

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
it is always more

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
about computers,

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and through this

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
digital connection,

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
literacy is needed

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and security

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
in the classroom,

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
so that the students know

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
which side is suspicious,

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
or a lot of confusing orders,

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
dressing up,

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
being aware

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that there are a lot of perverts,

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
so basic education

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is also needed in this direction,

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
even if it is not directly related

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to computer science.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Islan, what do the students

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
bring with them

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and if they could

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
bring more?

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now,

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the most I want

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
them to bring is interest.

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
When we have a promotion,

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
we always say

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that it can start from scratch,

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that we don't need to wake them up.

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Of course,

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
everyone is welcome,

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
but the most important thing is

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
interest, and maybe

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
what Ilja said,

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I mean,

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I teach computer science,

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so that we don't play

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
games between classes,

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
so that we learn programming,

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
so that we don't

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
somehow break

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the computer game.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
For example, we have

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the subject of learning games,

218
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and we teach them to learn games,

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
but it is for,

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
on the other hand,

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
not as a player,

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so what they could bring more

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
is perhaps

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to see in advance

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
what they will do,

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
what the challenge of computer science

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
brings.

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think that it is important

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
for the students to know how to present

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
or not know how to present,

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and you go with some illusion,

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
what do you think,

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
on the other hand, you go to a school

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and maybe in the end you are

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
disappointed,

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
or maybe you change your mind,

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
or maybe it was a double battle,

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
because you went somewhere where you were happier,

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and that was the goal.

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Now you don't have to be a programmer,

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
or whatever,

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
but to believe in what you will do,

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and what you will be satisfied with.

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But maybe

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that is

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
one of the biggest challenges

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
for all parents,

248
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to direct their children,

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
when you go to school,

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you try to explain to 14-year-olds

251
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that they have to choose

252
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
what they would like to do

253
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
for the rest of their lives.

254
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's say

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that you already have

256
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
an advanced computer

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
at home,

258
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
what would

260
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the world be like?

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is high school enough?

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Is high school the beginning

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
for the advancement

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
in computer science?

265
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is high school

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
free, or

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
does the computer universe

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
choose better?

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes,

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
that is a very good question.

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Where would I recommend you?

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My advice,

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
which I have been

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
noticing lately,

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is to look at your

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
younger self, and look

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
at your subculture.

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If he is more geeky,

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
don't put him in a computer school,

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
because he will suffer.

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
On the other hand,

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
if he already has his engine,

283
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
don't put him in a computer school,

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
because he will suffer.

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And the same thing,

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
if someone,

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will generalize a bit,

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is interested in philosophy,

289
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
psychology,

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
books,

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
maybe it is not a technical school,

292
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because,

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
as I said, I have two older sisters,

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
when they decided,

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and of course in primary school

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
it is fine,

297
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
but in primary school,

298
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
it doesn't matter

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
if you go to a high school,

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
a computer school,

301
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
a computer science school,

302
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
a cosmetic school,

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
a tourist school,

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and I remember,

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
when I talked to my older sister,

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
at the end of the first year of high school,

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
she said exactly that,

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
that she is much happier now,

309
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
because she has a similar self,

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and if she said at that time,

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I want to have a license,

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I will not have a license,

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
because she assessed it

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
on the basis of her balloon,

315
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and that would be the beginning

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
for anyone.

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Look where you fall,

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you have to survive with time.

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If someone chose

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
a high school at that time,

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
or an economic,

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
tourist school,

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
at the end of the first year of high school,

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
he still has enough time.

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think that secondary school

326
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is not the final destination,

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
because if you did not choose it,

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you are done.

329
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I would say,

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
if someone says at the beginning

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that he is interested in computer science,

332
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
he will be happier,

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
he will go to school more often,

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
because he will have a similar self there.

335
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
These are my conclusions

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
from all this learning.

337
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It is very interesting

338
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that this turned

339
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
into a character,

340
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
more than anything else,

341
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
because it is true,

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
at the end of those years,

343
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
this is what shapes them the most.

344
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ilja,

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
when you went to high school,

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
then you continued

347
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and successfully completed

348
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
both the diploma studies

349
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and then the master's degree.

350
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Where did you see

351
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
this added value?

352
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How did you build your knowledge

353
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
through all these stages?

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you ask

355
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
how it is in the service,

356
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think

357
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
these are the basics

358
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that you expand.

359
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Some basic principles,

360
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
soft skills,

361
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
you meet a lot of different people,

362
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in fact,

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
even older professors,

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and it is more

365
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
free, not like high school,

366
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you have someone,

367
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you can be there every day.

368
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Professors require

369
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
homework, there it is simple

370
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and you are really,

371
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
as Islam said,

372
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
when you want, you do it.

373
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And then you also build

374
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
your knowledge

375
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and learn to talk,

376
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
to approach professors,

377
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
which also helps in the service.

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I will

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
really relate to that.

380
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now,

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
after a month,

382
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
with fresh experience,

383
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you work in production.

384
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is there anything you would like

385
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to bring with you before?

386
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is there anything

387
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that surprised you

388
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
in the first service?

389
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think

390
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
nothing surprised me,

391
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
because the skill-up program,

392
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
which you mentioned at the beginning,

393
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
when we talked about it,

394
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
it simulated

395
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
production a bit,

396
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
so I got used to it.

397
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Otherwise, what would you like?

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Maybe to start a little earlier

399
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and have more freedom

400
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
so that I don't have such pauses

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and then start again.

402
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
If I felt

403
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
that I would be a little more consistent,

404
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I would change that.

405
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What about knowledge,

406
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
technology, syntax,

407
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
programming languages?

408
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Did you miss anything?

409
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Or was there

410
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
something too much?

411
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Too much knowledge?

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't think so.

413
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But if I missed something,

414
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I didn't pay attention.

415
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The first month,

416
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
maybe a little more,

417
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't know,

418
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
maybe in three months

419
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
they would give me a notebook

420
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
that I kept in my head.

421
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What about those

422
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
who are a little older

423
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and are tired of

424
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
formal education

425
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and would like to learn

426
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
programming

427
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
or IT?

428
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What is the world

429
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
like for them?

430
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Where to start

431
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
if you want to know more about this area

432
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and want to become a part of this industry?

433
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If you are interested,

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think the first thing

435
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
is not to look at

436
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
whether you are 18 years old

437
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and you want to come to this area

438
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
or you are too old.

439
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I will not say the numbers

440
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and say that this is old.

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I want to say that

442
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
first you have to be interested,

443
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
then you have to make a plan

444
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and thirdly,

445
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you have to make a routine.

446
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Today I have time

447
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and today I started learning to program.

448
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I didn't plan

449
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
where I would get this time

450
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
tomorrow, the day after,

451
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
in a week, in a month.

452
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Something happens in my life.

453
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sometimes our brains

454
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
are not the biggest

455
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
friends.

456
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
When I say that I will work tomorrow,

457
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
my brain says that

458
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you will work tomorrow.

459
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Tomorrow you will be serious.

460
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I think it is the same thing

461
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
with learning.

462
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think the third thing

463
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
is to make a routine

464
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and say that this is my goal

465
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and I want to get there

466
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
because of this and that.

467
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Whether it is because of better work conditions

468
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
or because you want to be surrounded

469
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
by such people

470
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and then prepare

471
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
when you will start.

472
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Today I start, today I have time

473
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
but I have to realize that I will have time

474
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
tomorrow or in two days

475
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and that this comes in a routine

476
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and definitely at the beginning

477
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I will say

478
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
like Donnie Kruger said

479
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
when you have a feeling that you are at the top

480
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and then a new problem comes

481
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
where you say that you have no idea

482
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and this happens all the time.

483
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And also later

484
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
when you are experienced

485
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I will say that this is a constant

486
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
but maybe I would say

487
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
to everyone that

488
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
the years are definitely not important

489
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
but you have to be interested

490
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you have to set a goal

491
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and a routine

492
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
so that you start every day

493
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
because otherwise

494
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
everything else will be wrong.

495
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This program was not good,

496
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
this tutorial was not good,

497
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
this does not know how to explain well.

498
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, there will be something else

499
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and I think that if you respect these three things

500
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that success

501
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
simply cannot

502
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
not happen.

503
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You are at such an

504
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
interesting intersection

505
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
of formal education

506
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
of the school on the one hand

507
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and then this program SkillUp Mentor

508
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
where you focus more

509
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
especially on some skills.

510
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes.

511
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
How does someone start?

512
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Is it a theory?

513
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Is it a specific

514
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
programming language?

515
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is it understanding?

516
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How do we go from a transistor

517
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
to an e-mail?

518
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That last one is definitely not.

519
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That last one is definitely not.

520
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I will say that technology is not important.

521
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I think

522
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
last time you talked about it

523
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I started with Turbo Pascal.

524
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know if it still exists

525
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but I think technology is not so important.

526
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But I noticed

527
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that we are really different types of people.

528
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
For example, I myself fall into

529
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
what I

530
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
really don't care about.

531
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I am like that.

532
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If it is a function that does something to me

533
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I put this data inside

534
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I will get it out.

535
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How it does it, I don't really care.

536
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will say

537
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and through SkillUp and through formal education

538
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I see that there are differences.

539
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
For example,

540
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
we have

541
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
a member of our community

542
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
SkillUp Mentor

543
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
she chooses books.

544
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
She started with Python The Hard Way.

545
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
For example, in my case

546
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
when I choose a book title

547
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I would not choose The Hard Way.

548
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Some people like to do it as a tutorial

549
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
which means that someone leads them.

550
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Others say

551
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I repeat but I don't learn anything.

552
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There is a little trick

553
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
understanding comes with time.

554
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sometimes it is enough to do

555
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
3, 4, 5 tutorials

556
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but again, I think

557
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
if you have a routine every day

558
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
when do you start

559
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
then when you come to the next tutorial

560
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you will see that

561
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
like Karate Kid

562
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
who broke his car at the end of the video

563
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
that nothing is left of it.

564
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Understanding comes with time.

565
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I would say

566
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
prepare yourself.

567
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If you don't have someone

568
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
at the beginning

569
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
to answer your questions

570
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
if you want to be

571
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
for example a developer

572
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
learn as soon as possible

573
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
how to learn by yourself

574
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
because you will not always have the opportunity

575
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
to ask someone

576
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
you will build a career

577
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and there will be fewer and fewer interlocutors.

578
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Whether it is a text

579
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
or you have

580
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
a text-based tutorial

581
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
or maybe

582
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I like text-based tutorials

583
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
because I am interested in a very small thing

584
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and I can't watch the whole video

585
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
to learn a lot of things

586
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
others would like to see

587
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
what they start

588
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
others choose to understand

589
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
what it is

590
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
so I think it is not so simple

591
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
to say exactly

592
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
how it would work

593
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and then try

594
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
to see where

595
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
it suits you.

596
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
On the internet

597
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
there are a lot of

598
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
free code

599
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
programs

600
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
where you have

601
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
in Slovenia

602
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
smart ninjas

603
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
which are very good

604
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
in this ecosystem

605
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
so you can learn this way.

606
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Do you have an estimate

607
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
how much time does someone need

608
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
to reach a certain level

609
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
in order to get a job?

610
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's start from scratch.

611
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
In our skill-up

612
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
we don't learn

613
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
programming

614
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
we only give skills

615
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because no one can come

616
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
or I would say

617
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
this is the beginning

618
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
but we also have

619
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
self-taught people

620
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
who come to us and we help them

621
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to get a job

622
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and there were self-taught people

623
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
who didn't want to come

624
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
to us

625
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
but this is a personal experience

626
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
so if I am careful

627
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and I will do this

628
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I will be able to speed up

629
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but again, less talent

630
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
less support

631
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
it would be hard to estimate

632
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
how much time someone needs

633
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
but if I would say

634
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
on a finger

635
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
half a year, one year

636
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I would say all these things

637
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and what I mentioned before

638
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
self-skills, self-learning

639
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
all of this you learn on the shoulder

640
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Maybe if I

641
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
relate to this

642
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
there is an idea

643
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I go to school

644
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I join and I get a job

645
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and things

646
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
don't always go that way

647
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
what was the connection

648
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
between all of this?

649
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Islam changed me

650
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
from the beginning

651
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
when I was a beginner

652
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I did projects

653
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
for a year and a half

654
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
but I started

655
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
3-4 months break

656
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a little bit of writing

657
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
a little bit of traveling

658
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I took a month off

659
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and then 6 months

660
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
so

661
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
then life came to me

662
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and I don't know

663
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
when I started looking

664
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
different conversations

665
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
technical interviews, tasks

666
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and then

667
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
you learn with that

668
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
on one interview you are better

669
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
more prepared

670
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and so it goes

671
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
step by step

672
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
so you worked on

673
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
some other projects

674
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
outside of school

675
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
or in a group

676
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
a few years ago

677
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I had my own project

678
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and in the last year or two

679
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I started

680
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
skill up

681
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
skill up

682
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
tasks, projects

683
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,740
When I took the time I had between classes, when I was an absolvent at the university, I started at Skilapo,

684
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:22,000
and when I graduated I had a bit more time, so I really took the time, set up a routine and then I finished.

685
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What did the juniors expect from you during the conversations?

686
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I think they said culture, that you are an open person, that you ask, that you know,

687
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and that they are happy and that I like that, that I ask a lot.

688
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:05,000
They said the problem of juniors, that I don't ask a lot, so I go to assess how much I can do on a specific problem,

689
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and then when I can't find a solution, I go to a partner or a senior and ask him.

690
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I think they wanted me to know how to learn and to be open, to know how to ask.

691
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Is there a difference between a student, a mentor or a writer?

692
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I think there is a big difference between a student and a writer.

693
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
In Skilapo I always say that if your company allows you to be a writer,

694
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
because at the end of the day you build trust, you get to know someone better,

695
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and I will say who will, because of course there will be some setbacks,

696
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
but if you can get in touch with someone you have already built a relationship with,

697
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and if there is no other option, there is of course the remote option,

698
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
so that you can be sure that all of us, and I will say older people as well,

699
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
we always have this impostor syndrome, or this feeling that maybe you don't control it,

700
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
there are a lot of these myths, that a junior is looking for how to make time,

701
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and a senior is also looking for the same thing,

702
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and I am ready to say that it is ok if you ask, and that is what Ilya said,

703
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
but if we go back to formal education, there we somehow learned that asking is not the best,

704
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
because then the professor will say that I don't know, so I will be quiet,

705
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and I will not ask anything, and then it is bad, for example,

706
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
in Skilapo we constantly ask, ask, ask, and ask even more.

707
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Also, of course, there is a normal difference,

708
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
probably Ilya, if he comes to his mentor and asks him something,

709
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
he will have a lot of answers, in school there may be a completely different answer,

710
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
these are probably such differences,

711
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
so if this is definitely a mentor, I would get in touch with him,

712
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
if there is no other option, there is also the remote option,

713
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I would say that it has already developed so much,

714
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
so we are already used to it, I don't think it represents so much.

715
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And one more big shortcoming of our school system,

716
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
this is for sure, this is a frontal statement of knowledge,

717
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
that even if you want to do something in the field,

718
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
to some extent you are a new student,

719
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and you learn new things, and that is the way the organization works.

720
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Is there anything else that you think you could do better,

721
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
or learn in a better way?

722
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I am very satisfied with our school system,

723
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
primarily because, as they always tell me, I have a bright future,

724
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
but I focus on things that work positively,

725
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and I have a huge team, which I am very proud of,

726
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and I am happy that they are my team,

727
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and when I see how much energy and effort they put in,

728
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and I also expect that the students who listen to this,

729
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
certainly have some professor,

730
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
maybe it was a teacher, I don't know,

731
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
of art, or math, elementary, high school,

732
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
who has changed me, I don't know,

733
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
in my life, or in the present moment.

734
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So, when it comes to this school, I am positive,

735
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
especially because I see a lot of people inside,

736
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
who are working very hard.

737
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Now, there are few things that could change,

738
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
but what is the goal?

739
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
If the goal is, as we said before,

740
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to become a computer scientist,

741
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
to learn as much as possible, to communicate,

742
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
we don't follow these things in the beginning.

743
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And if I go back to what you said about the two obligatory subjects,

744
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I totally support this,

745
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
because we have to discover,

746
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
we are all teachers,

747
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and we have to learn something,

748
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
on which I am not the most self-confident,

749
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I will, of course, spend less attention,

750
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and less time.

751
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And the idea, this option,

752
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
to become a computer scientist,

753
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
would be, in theory, excellent,

754
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
in practice, unfortunately, a little less,

755
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
because, as you said, I will,

756
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
in the field of computer science,

757
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't have a problem with green permanent things,

758
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
but if I don't feel self-confident enough,

759
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to teach about it, and of course,

760
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
even if I teach, it won't be the same energy,

761
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and I will say, young people won't learn the same way,

762
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
as we do in the database, or in other things,

763
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
which are close to me.

764
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And because of this, I think they would need,

765
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
first of all, a frame.

766
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
If you don't trust anyone,

767
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
let's say, to accept obstacles,

768
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and this is, I will say,

769
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
a frame in the sense that,

770
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I will say, in advance,

771
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
or I will go back,

772
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
we have a lot of teachers,

773
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and a lot of teachers who teach us in school,

774
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
but a teacher, a good teacher is not a bad teacher,

775
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I think they would have to work on the entrance,

776
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
as they say, mostly on the doors,

777
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
when you enter, or in the organization of the company,

778
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
in the end, also in the school,

779
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and they would have to work on this,

780
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but now, in the coming years, it's even worse,

781
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
because the lack of a frame is huge,

782
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and maybe someone came in, who would be a better engineer,

783
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and maybe a worse teacher,

784
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't know, if you give me a magic wand,

785
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know how I would solve this,

786
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't want you to think that I'm criticizing,

787
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
it's a very responsible job,

788
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
but I would say to everyone who is listening,

789
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
or maybe you are older,

790
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
go to those teachers who are really cool,

791
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
go and tell them,

792
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
when the next generation comes,

793
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And did COVID change anything,

794
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and help with digital literacy?

795
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes, the most.

796
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I had a lecture at school,

797
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and I said who digitized the school the most,

798
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and I gave 1% equality, 1% school, and 98% COVID.

799
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If it wasn't for COVID, it wouldn't be.

800
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I think that COVID has helped a lot,

801
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and if I go back to culture,

802
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and what we are interested in,

803
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I can tell you that we are not at the same level

804
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
of digitalization as we were,

805
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
we fell back to paper,

806
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and we were purely digital,

807
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but now that we are closer,

808
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
we see that we fell back to paper.

809
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But that is purely human.

810
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Maybe if we go back to the search for a job,

811
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
let's talk about the portfolio.

812
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Did you have a portfolio,

813
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
a project,

814
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
how did you see that part,

815
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
as well as your representation

816
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
in this part of the market?

817
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I didn't have a portfolio

818
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
as a split side,

819
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I used LinkedIn and GitHub,

820
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I wrote down all the projects I worked on,

821
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I added descriptions,

822
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and the tasks I received from companies

823
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
for conversations,

824
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I added them to GitHub,

825
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and I wrote them down nicely.

826
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
As far as the portfolio is concerned,

827
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that's it.

828
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Secondly, I wrote down what projects I worked on,

829
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
what I learned from them,

830
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
what difficulties I faced,

831
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
how I solved them.

832
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Did you have a feeling

833
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
that people opened their GitHub

834
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and saw that it was

835
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
a part of your portfolio?

836
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't know yet,

837
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
but they said it was positive.

838
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Everything was nicely presented,

839
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and they also sent me a code,

840
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
they said it was a reliable code.

841
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The comments,

842
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
depending on the participant,

843
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and who is interested in going into the details,

844
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
it's good to have them,

845
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
even if they don't look at it.

846
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I can't say

847
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
that it was positive,

848
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
but I can imagine

849
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that this program,

850
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
SkillUp Mentor,

851
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and your cooperation with companies,

852
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and also if we refer to the portfolio,

853
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
is it something that comes from their side,

854
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
that would be right?

855
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
With SkillUp Mentor,

856
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
when you finish your formal education,

857
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
we are ready to join some people

858
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
who work in some services,

859
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and in their opinion,

860
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
they would like to come to us

861
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and look at the modern stack.

862
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I connected with senior developers

863
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
from various companies,

864
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and we prepared a project-based program,

865
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
we also have a community,

866
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
where we support mentors,

867
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and we have a project in Figma,

868
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
where everything can be written in GitHub,

869
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
tasks that need to be done,

870
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and we work with full-stack web developers.

871
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
At the beginning, we had a very strict technology,

872
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but we held on,

873
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and in the end we saw that everything was fluid,

874
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
we have a framework, we have Java,

875
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
we have .NET,

876
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
we are not that specific,

877
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and I will say,

878
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
they also look at the campaign,

879
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
how to run these things,

880
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
how to estimate them,

881
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and the goal is not to estimate them correctly,

882
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the goal is to show that it is difficult,

883
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and that they know how to split tasks into smaller tasks,

884
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and when they have completed the task,

885
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
they have to deploy it.

886
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We work on AWS from Amazon,

887
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and they get a code review,

888
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
so the mentor goes through the code,

889
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and decides to try to improve it,

890
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I don't know if it would scale,

891
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
it wouldn't go through,

892
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and we write down the possibilities for improvement,

893
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
we get a new project,

894
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and we add a new technology,

895
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
which means that the old one maintains,

896
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and the new technology expands,

897
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and the mentor checks again,

898
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
if there was an improvement,

899
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
if there wasn't, where it would go.

900
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We work remotely,

901
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and we encourage them to ask,

902
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
so they know that it's not a problem to ask,

903
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and that there is always someone ready to help.

904
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And when they come to the end of our program,

905
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
for example Ilja,

906
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
then I talk to him,

907
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
what he wanted, what he wanted,

908
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I also help with CV, how he prepared it,

909
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
what Ilja said,

910
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I don't look at it as a tactic,

911
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
but I look at it as a step-back.

912
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
If you take a couple of hours,

913
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and you prepare everything,

914
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't think that if you choose between the two,

915
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
everyone would have everything prepared,

916
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and I think that it would be logical to choose the one I would.

917
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And we encourage them to prepare.

918
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Then I would say,

919
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I would like to mention,

920
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
that there are a lot of questions

921
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
about developers,

922
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
but in time,

923
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
maybe someone will come up with what you said before.

924
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
When I will conclude, I will say,

925
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
hey, I am here,

926
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
the business will grow,

927
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
but the topic will not be so open.

928
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You need to have a lot of knowledge,

929
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and I would like to say,

930
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that the success stories,

931
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
when someone came to a door,

932
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and they opened it,

933
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
not because they don't exist,

934
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
but because they are too exceptional.

935
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And the projects where the mentors work,

936
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
are they standard,

937
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
how many projects can you finish,

938
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
or are they projects that are in production?

939
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes, I would say,

940
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
that projects are a product.

941
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
They don't have to be in production,

942
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but they are school projects.

943
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I think that everyone gets the same.

944
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Because we tell them,

945
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
that they don't have to think,

946
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that they don't have to be in production.

947
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We also collaborate with other companies,

948
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
because they give us their own projects.

949
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
For example, we have a project with a stack.

950
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
We are not so powerful in their stack,

951
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and we tell them,

952
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that this is the company,

953
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
it has such and such a challenge,

954
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and the company prepares everything for them.

955
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We have 5 projects,

956
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
but it depends.

957
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Ilja, I think you only made 2,

958
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and we already agreed that it is not necessary,

959
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
that we keep it,

960
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
but it is already prepared to go to the service.

961
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Or maybe we will make another project,

962
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
because we also had a self-employed person.

963
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
How did you choose the first service,

964
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
what criteria did you have?

965
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Did you have any criteria for yourself?

966
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Or was it just to be?

967
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
How did you choose it?

968
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Good question.

969
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
First of all, I didn't want it to be

970
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
that technology,

971
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
when I was self-employed,

972
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
when I had already learned.

973
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I worked in React,

974
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
but then I was more for React.

975
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
First it was some kind of an artist,

976
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and even if it was a hybrid,

977
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
over time,

978
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I got a job in Ljubljana.

979
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I drove every day from Velenje in the first month.

980
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It wasn't hard for me to get up in the morning,

981
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
every day, an hour and a half, 40.

982
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I like to come to the shift,

983
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
because I like to ask,

984
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and because of that,

985
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
it was often remote,

986
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
so it was possible to move forward.

987
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
That I have a mentor,

988
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
someone in the team,

989
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
or a few people I can turn to,

990
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
that it was important to me

991
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to learn new things,

992
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
new technologies,

993
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
so that maybe in the evening,

994
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
on Nes, on Backend,

995
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I would be interested in something.

996
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I told Isla,

997
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
when I finished the project,

998
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
that I was interested,

999
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and Isla said,

1000
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
that such a good first job,

1001
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
which offers support and mentorship,

1002
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
and includes the environment,

1003
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
which also shows you good engineering culture,

1004
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I think it's a good starting point for a long career.

1005
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
What I notice is that

1006
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
we often have problems

1007
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
with juniors who have no experience

1008
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and don't understand what a good job is.

1009
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
If I had an answer to that,

1010
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I would use it more,

1011
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
because I know exactly what you're talking about.

1012
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But sometimes I'm a bit,

1013
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
or I would say,

1014
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
who am I to judge,

1015
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
that the culture in which you are now,

1016
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
is bad for you.

1017
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I try to talk to them,

1018
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and I also notice that

1019
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
juniors stay in the industry for a long time,

1020
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and I would say,

1021
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
maybe later,

1022
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
maybe they are not fit for the industry,

1023
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
but if I had an answer to that,

1024
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
what would I say to someone,

1025
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
but unfortunately I don't know how I would wake him up.

1026
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Maybe Ilija Sportrader,

1027
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
maybe you can tell us more about

1028
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
what do you see as a support

1029
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
for juniors,

1030
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
or what does it mean

1031
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
for you to feel like you're not alone

1032
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and you have to know yourself.

1033
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
First of all,

1034
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
that juniors cooperate in all situations.

1035
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I didn't expect that.

1036
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
When we talk about new functionalities,

1037
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
when we divide tasks,

1038
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
when we decide on time,

1039
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I've been there for a week,

1040
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and I've already been there,

1041
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
when we were sorting out tasks,

1042
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
deciding how much is required,

1043
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
so that I'm included,

1044
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
when you said I'm not included,

1045
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
when we were sorting out onboarding projects,

1046
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
a 20-year-old project,

1047
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
they gave me what to do.

1048
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I got a task for the first week,

1049
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and I added a feature to the production.

1050
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's the relationship.

1051
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
When I had a question,

1052
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I always got an answer.

1053
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm happy if someone

1054
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
sends me a picture,

1055
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because they come to me,

1056
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and they don't expect a senior to sit down

1057
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and show me everything.

1058
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I really like that culture.

1059
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I would definitely suggest

1060
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
that all juniors

1061
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
change regularly

1062
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and educate themselves,

1063
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
because they see different systems,

1064
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
different engineering cultures,

1065
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and they find it easier.

1066
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That was one of the biggest shocks

1067
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
when I joined Recruiting.

1068
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You have people who wanted to work

1069
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
on some projects,

1070
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and you think you won't find anyone

1071
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
who would want that.

1072
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You have to think about

1073
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
what someone wants,

1074
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
what they are good at,

1075
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and then you can find your home.

1076
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I also saw the other side of it,

1077
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
when someone stayed for 5, 7, 10 years

1078
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
and then seriously threatened

1079
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
the further development of their career

1080
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
because they stayed in a company

1081
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and didn't have healthy practices,

1082
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
testing,

1083
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
and other basic things.

1084
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Maybe,

1085
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
one part of it is that

1086
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
the company wanted to show off

1087
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and make it work

1088
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
in their system.

1089
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
We also have companies

1090
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
with different academies,

1091
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
different courses,

1092
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
summer schools.

1093
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You have a lot of experience

1094
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
in the field of Islam.

1095
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Who is this for?

1096
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Is it only for people without formal education?

1097
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
What are the gaps

1098
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that you want to fill?

1099
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I predict this.

1100
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't know exactly,

1101
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
but it depends on the company.

1102
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I predict that every company

1103
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
is looking for a white whale

1104
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
to catch someone who is extremely talented

1105
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and will come to them.

1106
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I am very surprised,

1107
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
because I think all these things

1108
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
are very important.

1109
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I have a lot of experience in this field.

1110
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
We realized that

1111
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the linear education

1112
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is not a serious project.

1113
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
In the academy,

1114
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
we have the same goal,

1115
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but we all have different beginnings.

1116
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Ilja came to us with a different beginning

1117
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
when he did a lot of small projects.

1118
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The initial step was huge.

1119
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
If we put him in a school

1120
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and taught him everything,

1121
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
it would be either too long-term

1122
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
or too demanding.

1123
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
The classical school system

1124
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
that they had in the academies

1125
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
doesn't work in my opinion.

1126
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I predict that

1127
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
someone who already has a lot of experience

1128
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
will come to them.

1129
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
They will want to work with them.

1130
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It will be a three-hour conversation.

1131
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I am sure that one day

1132
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
a senior will tell them

1133
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
how to do it.

1134
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I think that this is welcome

1135
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and we will be able to learn more.

1136
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
They will tell us

1137
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and we will change something.

1138
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
When we started two years ago,

1139
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I was very grateful.

1140
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I called you and asked you

1141
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
what you think about this project.

1142
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You said that it is very welcome

1143
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and we would need it.

1144
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,880
We would support that as well.

1145
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,880
If I would have been told that it has nothing to do with me,

1146
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,160
maybe I wouldn't have done it.

1147
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,160
I think that now, after so much experience,

1148
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,000
we definitely need that, and that young people,

1149
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,200
and again, this is my balloon,

1150
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,200
with whom I hang out,

1151
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,200
I know that they will be excellent participants.

1152
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,040
Someone who came in the afternoon, in the morning,

1153
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,040
to educate himself, to contribute as much as possible

1154
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,040
and with whom I would have started,

1155
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,040
I think I don't need to explain more,

1156
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,040
and there are not so few of them,

1157
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,040
who know that, for example, when I was doing analysis,

1158
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,040
when I started with this program,

1159
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,040
when I asked the juniors when they came,

1160
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,040
for example, what Ilja was talking about,

1161
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,040
screwing some old projects in a cage for some business,

1162
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,040
it kills their feeling, their morale,

1163
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,040
to be able to contribute as soon as possible.

1164
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,040
I think it's great that you are doing this,

1165
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,040
that you can come in the first week,

1166
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,040
or after the first two weeks,

1167
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,040
and start producing things.

1168
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,040
That is definitely a special feeling,

1169
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,040
when you can do that.

1170
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,040
What are your messages

1171
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,040
in regards to this program?

1172
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,040
Do you think that it would be...

1173
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,040
What did it give you,

1174
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,040
maybe additionally,

1175
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,040
that you didn't have at school?

1176
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,040
Do you think that because of a program like this,

1177
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,040
you are now more employed?

1178
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,040
First of all, knowledge, let's say.

1179
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,040
I work in React.

1180
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,040
I have some basics from other languages,

1181
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,040
from other Java scripts,

1182
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,040
I work less,

1183
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,040
and then I learned Java script, TypeScript,

1184
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,040
and then React,

1185
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,039
that's one thing, not all technologies,

1186
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,039
the other is soft skills,

1187
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:15,039
to work with others,

1188
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,039
I mean, on the project,

1189
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:21,039
one is on another level,

1190
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,039
and then you ask something,

1191
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:27,039
you write it in Discord,

1192
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,039
and then you get it.

1193
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:33,039
I know that one of the first meetings

1194
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,039
we had online,

1195
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:39,039
I had a problem with a project for two weeks,

1196
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,039
I had a problem with it,

1197
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:45,039
and then I asked Clem,

1198
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:48,039
he was working on Java,

1199
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,039
and in two minutes, it was done.

1200
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,039
If I had asked him before,

1201
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:57,039
it would have been better.

1202
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,039
When to ask, how much time do you need,

1203
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:03,039
that's what I like the most.

1204
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,039
Already in the first episode,

1205
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:09,039
I also admit that soft skills

1206
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,039
are the most important skills for an engineer,

1207
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:15,039
maybe it's not so obvious,

1208
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:18,039
but we really go back and forth

1209
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:21,039
on soft skills,

1210
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,039
that you are welcome,

1211
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:27,039
that you know how to ask,

1212
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,039
that you know how to communicate,

1213
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:33,039
that you are a pleasant partner,

1214
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,039
that was the most interesting outcome

1215
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:39,039
for me from the first two episodes,

1216
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,039
because in my field,

1217
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:45,039
there is a lot of technical excellence,

1218
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,039
experience, and what you have already done,

1219
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:51,039
you have already worked on such a system,

1220
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,039
and often those soft skills are important,

1221
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:57,039
but they come as a second,

1222
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,039
and the third is linear.

1223
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:03,039
I think we go back to the fact

1224
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,039
that this is an important part for a junior.

1225
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:09,039
Soft skills are already soft skills,

1226
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,039
but they are fundamental skills,

1227
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:15,039
because without them it will be very difficult.

1228
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,040
Our mentor, Clement Plazar,

1229
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,040
definitely wasn't so successful,

1230
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,040
if it wasn't for his soft skills,

1231
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,040
his approach, how someone asks him,

1232
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,040
how nicely he responds, helps him,

1233
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,040
I am very grateful to him for that,

1234
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,040
and how important it is for all the mentors

1235
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,040
who are in the field,

1236
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,040
that they take the time to explain,

1237
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,040
because I can tell you that for a junior

1238
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,040
it is really stressful.

1239
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,040
It is really stressful for him to come

1240
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,040
and ask him 100 questions,

1241
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,040
and you give him that attention,

1242
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,040
and with us, Clement is excellent,

1243
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,040
and I think that for the juniors,

1244
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,040
when they ask him how it all starts,

1245
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,040
they have the most time in mentoring,

1246
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,040
and that the right mentors choose them.

1247
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,040
I think that those who are good developers

1248
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,040
don't have to be very good mentors,

1249
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,040
so I think they solve it well.

1250
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,040
We are getting closer to one hour

1251
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,040
of our conversation,

1252
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,040
so we will wrap up in time,

1253
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,040
but before we do that,

1254
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,040
I would like to ask Ilija,

1255
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,040
is there anything else you would like to say?

1256
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,040
Do you have a message for all those

1257
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,040
who are thinking about joining

1258
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,040
the team of juniors,

1259
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,040
or on the other hand, for mentors,

1260
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,040
professors, and those who are looking

1261
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,040
for a new role?

1262
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,040
I think that we have come to the end

1263
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,040
of soft skills.

1264
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,040
One thing is technical knowledge,

1265
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,040
and the other thing is that you need

1266
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,040
that time to get used to it.

1267
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,040
When I was looking for a job,

1268
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,040
I got feedback that I liked it a lot

1269
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,040
when they sent me an assignment,

1270
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,040
and that I went through it,

1271
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,040
and that I didn't ask about it again,

1272
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,040
because the assignments were more open,

1273
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,040
and that I didn't ask about it,

1274
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,040
and that I could be more specific about it,

1275
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,040
if the technology was okay,

1276
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,040
if I could use those libraries,

1277
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,040
and that seemed normal to me,

1278
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,040
but after the interview,

1279
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,040
I was asked about the parameters,

1280
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,040
and that I had to be more specific.

1281
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,040
So, yes, it's about the end.

1282
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,040
You ask, and the more open you are,

1283
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,040
the less fear you have to ask,

1284
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,040
and to join.

1285
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,040
I think that's the key,

1286
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,040
that you are not afraid.

1287
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,040
We all started somewhere,

1288
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,040
Islam?

1289
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,040
Yes, for the end,

1290
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,040
I would like to thank everyone

1291
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,040
who helped us at the beginning,

1292
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,040
and all the children who supported us,

1293
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,040
and joined us.

1294
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Thank you for the initial conversations,

1295
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,040
and for the feedback,

1296
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,040
and for building a very proud relationship,

1297
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,040
so that when we get visitors,

1298
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,040
we see that what we do contributes to them.

1299
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,040
When it comes to the school,

1300
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,040
I think that the most important thing

1301
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,040
is the staff.

1302
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,040
If the staff is focused,

1303
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,040
then what is written in the programs,

1304
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,040
I would put it in the second place,

1305
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,040
and in the first place,

1306
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,040
Thank you.

1307
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,040
Thank you for this source,

1308
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,040
and I hope that everyone heard it.

1309
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,040
It is a wider social debate,

1310
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,040
I think, about school in general.

1311
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,040
That's it for the second episode of Zagora.

1312
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Thank you again for responding.

1313
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,039
All those who listen to us,

1314
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:36,039

on YouTube,

1318
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,039
and because we really try hard

1319
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:51,039
to produce these podcasts,

1320
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,039

or if you are our Patreon supporter,

00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,039
so that you can support us.

1325
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:09,039
We also want to open up

1326
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,039
very relevant topics.

1327
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:15,039
It is relevant that we got

1328
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,039
the first sponsorship.

1329
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:21,039
I would like to thank the 3FS and Human Frog

1330
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,039
for the support,

1331
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:27,039
so that we can create a community

1332
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,039
that helps the entire Slovenian community.

1333
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:34,039
That's it for this Saturday.

1334
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:37,039
Thank you for taking the time.

1335
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,039
Thank you to Otet and the team

1336
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:43,039

Listen and watch our show.
