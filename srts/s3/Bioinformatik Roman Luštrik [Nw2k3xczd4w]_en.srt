1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
About 10 seconds before the start, we can start with the 2nd episode of the 3rd season of Ogrodie.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's almost the 40th episode of our podcast.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today, a bit more simplified, we'll talk about data science, a bit about Aero, a bit about Python,

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we'll have a bit of fun with Roman's and Andraž's computer.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We had fun with your computer.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm still jealous that it's my computer.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Today, we visited Roman Luštrih's Ogrodie.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Roman is one of those people who saw that we'll be doing our podcast.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He said, guys, wait, I'll come and show you how to record a podcast.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hold my beer, and he showed us the equipment.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you for that, too, three years ago.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I already forgot about that.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You brought us a beer and said, guys, you need this, you need that.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you open a beer, I'll record it even better.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've never done that before.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Exactly, I just came.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today, we have a big man in our podcast.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hope it'll be fun and interesting for everyone.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can have pompous presentations.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Twitter influencer, podcaster.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'd go on Twitter and see what they write there.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Geniuses or geniuses.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Geniuses.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'd go on Twitter and see what they write there.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'd go on Twitter and see what they write there.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Geniuses.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Genitals.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Nice.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's quite intimate.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It depends, sometimes yes, sometimes no.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think that from our audience, people probably met you the most at the Python meetup.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes, the locals met me at the Python meetup.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Those who do a bit of Aero met me at Stack Overflow.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
At Stack Overflow?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, because I started there in 2009.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
First, I studied at Aero, then when I started going back to society,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I wrote a lot of answers.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
One of my answers was asked,

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
what comes up when you start getting to know the basics of Aero?

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think it happened once or twice,

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
that a key researcher from Flow came to me.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When I was still working at the Department of Biology,

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
they called me on the phone,

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Roman, come down, we have a researcher here,

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
who also works at Aero.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I came down and introduced myself,

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and Roman came and said,

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I know who you are.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
From where?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
From Stack Overflow.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I see your post a lot.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It happened to me twice.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Most of our guests,

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
after our conversations,

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we also talked a bit with Andraž,

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
it seems that people who are primarily developers,

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and then conquer some other domains,

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you are not a developer.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What do you think about that?

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are right.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I am not a developer.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was inspired by computers.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When I was 12 years old,

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I got my first Commodore.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I knew how to play a game,

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I knew how to run,

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then I got a PC,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and then we started playing games.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There was no real school work in 1997.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You had to work on a computer.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Then I came to IRC,

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and I did a bit of scripting.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have always been into computers,

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but my passions were more or less alive.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I am also a veterinary technician.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The short story is that I am a veterinary technician,

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
then I am a gynaecologist,

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
then a failed student of zootechnics,

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
a biologist,

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and a statistician.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I still lack some kind of a ceramic,

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but I can cover it.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It will go well.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, I have decided not to use ceramics.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But I have mastered the skill of using

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
isotects and styroduras.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So if I need it,

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will come to you.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What do you do in biology?

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You research from the field of biology,

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and for you Python and R are tools

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
that you use to help.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is that how you imagined it?

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I got it from a practical point of view.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When I started writing my thesis,

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I had to analyze the data.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How do you do it?

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I asked Jerpota, Jer Nepolajnar,

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
if you have ever looked at Wikipedia,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and he said,

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
come and look at R.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I downloaded it,

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
tried it a bit,

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was impressed,

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
because it was so easy,

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
so logical.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What drew me to it is

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that it is very well documented.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
None of the tools I have used so far

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
have been so well documented.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Not only that,

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but how do you do the analysis?

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It was very relevant to me,

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
because I needed a lot of analysis

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
for my thesis.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I just put my data in there,

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and it was a bit of an error,

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
because I didn't understand

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
how to do all the details.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But when I looked at it,

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I got the results,

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the table, the picture,

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and it was clear to me

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
how to program it.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then I started to use

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
more advanced techniques.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
At the beginning,

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I just analyzed the data,

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and then I started to program it.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Over time, as R grew,

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
R got more and more popular.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you think that

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
people who don't know R yet,

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
for example,

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
are listening to you now,

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that the first thing

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that comes to their mind

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is probably some kind of

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
data analysis,

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
at the end of high school,

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
in high school,

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I hope not.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or maybe never.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I imagine that

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
people first used Excel.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is that OK?

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Is that OK?

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Excel is a very good tool.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's not perfect,

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but it's a good tool

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
for collecting data.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's good for visualization.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But if you want to do

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
a little bit of real science,

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
where you want the data to be repeatable,

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to be documented,

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
you need a practical code.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because you can't write in a document,

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
in Excel, first I clicked on it,

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
then I opened the menu,

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and then I just picked it up.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In R, it's all in code,

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
documented,

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you write a script,

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and it can be executed.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
On the assumption

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
that Excel has support for Python,

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
do you think that will be...

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, that's also...

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is that an opportunity

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to look at Excel?

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, I mean,

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
on the one hand, it's possible.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I imagine it has some advantages,

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
most people,

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
when they start,

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
they think that

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
it's not that much of an added value.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's probably something,

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but maybe they could try and see.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I mean,

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
those who deal with data more seriously,

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
because we don't have it.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I mean, we don't have it categorically,

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
mainly because

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
it includes so many technical problems.

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's take an example.

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
For example,

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
scientists went to change

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
the name of a human gene,

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
because Excel changed it to a date.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
OK.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But,

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
does that require a tool?

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Of course,

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
because you have to define

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
the type of column,

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and then it's fine,

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
but the average user doesn't understand that.

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then,

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
let's say,

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
if you import CSV,

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or some flat file,

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
a file that doesn't have

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
a definition of types,

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
it will ruin it.

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And then you will have to

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
fix it.

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And of course,

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
you ruin it.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think that's how it is.

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And you also see that

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
tools are more appropriate

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
for your work.

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes, that's right.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But, as I said at the beginning,

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
data collection,

219
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
if you want to collect data,

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it's ideal to have a form

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
where you have pre-selections,

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and you just click and don't move.

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
In Excel,

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
you can do whatever you want,

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
which is very convenient

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and fast,

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but it can cause a lot of trouble

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
in the dataset,

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and cleaning the data

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
takes a lot of time,

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and you have to be careful

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
that the data is not

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
consistent.

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
On the other hand,

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
you need to be a programmer,

236
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and you need to know

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
what tools to use

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to define it,

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and how to do it.

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Andraž,

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
what is your experience

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
with R?

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes, I tried it a few days

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
before this recording,

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and then,

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
because I've been programming

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Python for many years,

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and there's a book

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
called Panda,

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was like,

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
aha, now I understand

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
why we do things like that

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
in Panda,

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and I was like,

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think I've found my way.

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I went to Ops,

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
which we also had

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
in the previous episode,

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
because it's an open data portal,

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and I took the PC access,

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I forgot the format

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
of the data,

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
which is a more commercial software,

264
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and I installed a library in R,

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
so I could go through it,

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and I did,

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and I got the data frame,

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and I sorted it

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
by age,

270
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
average,

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the lowest age,

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and all the municipalities,

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
which I was interested in the least.

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I did that for about

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
one hour,

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
because I thought,

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
OK, what can we do in one hour,

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and we can do it really fast.

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And now I'm looking at a few books

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that explain statistics

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and how to use it,

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and maybe because of that

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
it's a bit more interesting.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So, you can actually

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
put a code on top,

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and that means that

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
when you have an experimental article,

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you put some visualizations there,

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and then you put the data

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
in the A app,

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and then in the B app,

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and then R code.

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right, you can put it

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
in a script,

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
or today I've noticed

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that people put a link

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
to GitHub repo,

298
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
which is a bit stupid,

299
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
because in the next few years

300
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
it won't die,

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and it will be repetitive,

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
but people will still

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
take the article,

304
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and then deal with it.

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What you mentioned,

306
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
one thing,

307
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
which I've already mentioned today,

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
is that it's very well documented.

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You have a lot of help.

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In addition to those vignettes,

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
where the analyses are somehow

312
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
described,

313
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
you have books in each area,

314
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and how to do it in R.

315
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think it's very well done,

316
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
because you take a book,

317
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and you rewrite it,

318
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and the things you have in the book

319
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
come out.

320
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And you really have that,

321
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
from mathematics to biology,

322
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
time analysis,

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
ecology,

324
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I learned all those things

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
through those books,

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and not only theoretically,

327
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you open a book,

328
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and you see mathematical formulas,

329
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and they come to you.

330
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But actually,

331
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
people who are serious

332
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
make tools in R,

333
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
a function package,

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and you just say

335
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the name of the function,

336
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
some data,

337
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and things come out.

338
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Of course, I could take

339
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
those mathematical formulas

340
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and write it myself,

341
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and then it takes a lot of time

342
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
to iterate

343
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and make solutions yourself.

344
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But it's a shame

345
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that everyone does it themselves,

346
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
because if you can do it in one way,

347
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
people can use it.

348
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Scientists are users,

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
most of them,

350
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
99% or more,

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
are users of those solutions,

352
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and it's much easier

353
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
for us,

354
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
first of all,

355
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
in time,

356
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to make it more consistent,

357
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and I believe

358
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
that R was deserved

359
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
for being a place

360
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
where we were able

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to make science

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
at a next level.

363
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We're not there yet,

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
because, for example,

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
reproducible science

366
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
is not there yet,

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but I think Python is growing

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and is on the right track

369
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to make it possible.

370
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If I want to learn a domain,

371
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
for example,

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I have some patterns,

373
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
some measurements,

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and I want to know

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
what the average value is,

376
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and how those values

377
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
are distributed,

378
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
instead of just taking

379
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
a textbook from math

380
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
or whatever,

381
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I can take a book in R

382
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and there are some basic concepts

383
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
in there,

384
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
such as probability,

385
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
or mathematical confidence,

386
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
or correlation,

387
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and then you play a little

388
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and it's interactive.

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Right, and you have all of that.

390
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's also a book,

391
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
R for Dummies,

392
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
because if you're too grateful,

393
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you'll also need me.

394
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Humblebrag, no,

395
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
not humble.

396
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And you have exactly that in there,

397
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the basics of R

398
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
on basic concepts

399
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and basic knowledge,

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the biological part,

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I have a full book,

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and I have,

403
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
let's say,

404
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
3-4 meters,

405
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I only have R books,

406
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
how to do something in R,

407
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or in S, technically,

408
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but it's the same.

409
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How is S connected to R?

410
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
S is a commercial package,

411
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and then these two guys said

412
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
fuck this shit,

413
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and they wrote an open source

414
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
part of the code for S,

415
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
also in R.

416
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
OK.

417
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Can I ask you,

418
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
very quickly after all these R tutorials,

419
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
can you come to,

420
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
in Python,

421
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
is this data frame,

422
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the concept of data frame,

423
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
does it have something similar,

424
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
or is it also called data frame,

425
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
or some internal structure,

426
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
can you tell me a little more?

427
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Right, in R you have

428
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
a vector,

429
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
a vector is an array,

430
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
one-dimensional,

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
then you have a matrix,

432
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
which is two-dimensional,

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
then you also have a multidimensional matrix,

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
then you have a data frame,

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
then a sheet,

436
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
a sheet is basically

437
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
like having

438
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
a map,

439
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and then you can jump inside,

440
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you can be in a school,

441
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
you can be anywhere,

442
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
you can be in any element,

443
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you also have functions

444
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that know how to systematically

445
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
access those elements,

446
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
recursively,

447
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and so on.

448
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And at the beginning of the topic,

449
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
you can make some type of

450
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
very complex objects,

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
that carry some kind of information,

452
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
for example,

453
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you have a complex object

454
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
that carries a sparse,

455
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
how do you say it,

456
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
a data frame,

457
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and then you also have a metadata,

458
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
which is a typical data frame,

459
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and you have two completely different concepts,

460
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
but in one object.

461
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And it's combined,

462
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and you act like it's a data frame,

463
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
a typical table

464
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
with rows and columns,

465
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and that's it.

466
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Do you work with large amounts of data?

467
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Like R,

468
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know,

469
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
terabytes of data,

470
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
is that an abstraction,

471
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
or is it still R,

472
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
or are you always in some kind of subset?

473
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How is it inside?

474
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Not natively,

475
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
everything is stored in memory,

476
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and then you limit how much data you have,

477
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
which is a bit easier today,

478
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
because you have an instance,

479
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and then you have this memory,

480
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
you do something,

481
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you close it,

482
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and it becomes 5 euros.

483
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But I think,

484
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
you can have large clusters,

485
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
which are gigabytes and gigabytes,

486
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
or terabytes,

487
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
large files,

488
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and you can't store them all at once,

489
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it doesn't make sense,

490
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
why would you store cluster data

491
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
for the whole world,

492
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
if you only need it for storage?

493
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And you have methods,

494
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
you have a package,

495
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
where you tell it to store

496
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
from this geographical width to this,

497
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and so on,

498
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
a square,

499
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and then you analyze it,

500
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
while you work.

501
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So, one kind of theory,

502
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and then you also have,

503
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think,

504
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
in DAPACIA,

505
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
they have some formats,

506
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
where you can work

507
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
in a similar way,

508
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
only with metrics,

509
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I mean,

510
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
with tabular data,

511
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
everything is technically

512
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
a table,

513
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you can work in memory,

514
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
but you can also

515
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
work with a bit of switching,

516
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
with unusual data.

517
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I wanted to say,

518
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that Erson made statistics

519
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
for his needs,

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and it was like,

521
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
organically,

522
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
good word,

523
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but it's not super consistent.

524
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You know,

525
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the name of the argument

526
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
in one function is different

527
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
than in the other.

528
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Sometimes there is a lot of

529
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
pressure,

530
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
sometimes little pressure,

531
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
because for someone

532
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
who is new to it,

533
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
it's very fluid,

534
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
for us old people

535
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
who are used to it,

536
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
it's like a dream,

537
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but today,

538
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know,

539
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
in 2010,

540
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
it started to grow,

541
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
well, not grow,

542
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and it developed

543
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
not only for statistics,

544
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but also for other things.

545
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
For example,

546
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
they made a framework

547
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
for writing

548
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
web apps,

549
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
like Shiny,

550
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
or Django,

551
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
or something like that.

552
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Ok.

553
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's not as good as Django.

554
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's like when you export

555
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Python plugins

556
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
into a widget,

557
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
you know that.

558
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You can't export it,

559
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
you can deploy it,

560
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
like Streamlit.io

561
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
or something like that.

562
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You have elements

563
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and you just install them.

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And then you export it

565
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
as a web app?

566
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Exactly.

567
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You just have .R file

568
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and you deploy it

569
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
to a server

570
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and it serves as an app.

571
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So you get some interactivity

572
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
on the data.

573
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You have a slider

574
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and you can move it.

575
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Exactly.

576
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You can interact with it

577
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
back and forth.

578
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
By changing your inputs,

579
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you can influence

580
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the user interface.

581
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It really helps

582
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
if you have knowledge

583
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
of JavaScript.

584
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But even without that,

585
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
you can do really interesting things,

586
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
really big things.

587
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Boilerplate for example.

588
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If I had a dashboard

589
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and I showed this

590
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and that on it,

591
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I could do anything.

592
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The most important thing

593
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is that you have CSS

594
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and those colors.

595
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That has developed a lot

596
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and is used a lot.

597
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In addition to being used

598
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
in different areas of science,

599
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
chemistry, pharmacy,

600
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
biology,

601
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
economy,

602
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
spatial problems,

603
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and so on.

604
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Can I ask you

605
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
where does this RStudio

606
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
come from?

607
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If you watch a lot of tutorials

608
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and you have the language R

609
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
or S

610
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
or KT,

611
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
what is this RStudio?

612
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What is it?

613
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's a very good question.

614
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
On Stack Overflow,

615
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
people change it non-stop.

616
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Sometimes, when I don't know

617
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
what to do,

618
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I try to fix tags

619
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
because people give RStudio tags.

620
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But RStudio has nothing to do

621
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
with R as such.

622
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Sometimes we had R,

623
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
which is a program

624
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
with a lot of tags.

625
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Sometimes it looked like

626
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
you had a terminal open

627
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and a text

628
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and a notepad.

629
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You copied and pasted it

630
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
into the code.

631
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We also had some plugins

632
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
for Notepad++ and so on.

633
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But it was very complicated

634
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
to install for new users.

635
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Then some good guys

636
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
came in

637
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and started working on IDE

638
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
which I called RStudio.

639
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You install RStudio

640
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and everything works.

641
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You have a text editor

642
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and you write a note,

643
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
you assign a cursor,

644
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
you press CTRL, ENTER

645
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and it comes out

646
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and everything works.

647
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Is it similar to Jupyter Notebooks

648
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
from Python?

649
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No.

650
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's possible too,

651
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
but not in the basics.

652
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We used to have a terminal

653
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and a text editor

654
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and it was integrated.

655
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You click on a function

656
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and press F1

657
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and a help file opens.

658
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You can also change

659
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
the key bindings.

660
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But this helped

661
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
new users.

662
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
When we had a workshop

663
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
in R,

664
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the first thing

665
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
to do

666
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
was to open

667
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and it works.

668
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It saves a lot.

669
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's not a perfect product,

670
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but it's good enough.

671
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It has it's problems.

672
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You can also look at

673
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the relevant results

674
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and the data frame.

675
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You can look at

676
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
what's in your memory.

677
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You can look at it

678
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and manage it.

679
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes, you can

680
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
interactively

681
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
with those

682
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
data frames.

683
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And then you have a problem, if you don't do it in the script, you don't know what you've done or you forget what you've done.

684
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Although you can look at the story, but it can be a hundred times worse and then you get lost.

685
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:30,000
When I was playing, I installed R, which is also open source, then I installed RStudio, which is also a community version, which is a Fero license.

686
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And then I wrote it down, and as they say, one window I had for visualization, the other was for Ripple.

687
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So I had an ultra-specialized development environment for that.

688
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Considering that you use Python a lot, do you notice that there are no functions or libraries in R, for example, that are used in Python?

689
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I think about it a lot, because I use Python and R a lot in my day job, and I see that there are better solutions in Python than in R and vice versa.

690
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So I have a love-hate relationship with all topics.

691
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Specifically, for example, I got into object programming.

692
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
In Python, I really don't like it at all.

693
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In R, it's almost a disaster.

694
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
In R, you have, I think, four or more types of object programming.

695
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Pick one, and then it's not so nice.

696
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
For example, with Python.

697
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's one thing, for example, because Python is much better.

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The other thing is that in R, the solution is much better.

699
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
As a community, we are lucky to have a package called ggplot2, which implements the grammar of graphics.

700
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's a concept where you draw on layers, first in the back, then you give points, then you give lines, and you can change each layer in your own way.

701
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's really good, because you get data when you have one column down, and you choose two images for male and female.

702
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's like this.

703
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Tilt down, and something happens.

704
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's really well done.

705
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
In Python, it's unfortunate that the matplotlib is so extensive, and it's terrible for me.

706
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
For the same image in R, I need three or four types.

707
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
In matplotlib, I'll need 150 types.

708
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Everything can be done, but it's not easy.

709
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You need to know all the features.

710
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That's right.

711
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's really complicated, but everyone is trying now.

712
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
There's a plotline library in Python, which implements ggplot2.

713
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The syntax is very similar, and I often get stuck in it.

714
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I try to draw a picture in the theme, because it's faster.

715
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There's a lot of artificial intelligence in LLVM.

716
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:33,000
A lot of tooling is developed in Python, and in C++, with nice wrappers and bindings for Python.

717
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If you look at all the new-age technologies, Python is in the lead.

718
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What's in R?

719
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Nothing.

720
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
As I said, it's all written in Python.

721
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
R is behind it, because it's all about deep learning.

722
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
There are libraries for deep learning in R,

723
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
but they're just called Keras or Python.

724
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I tried it, and it was so buggy that I had a Python error.

725
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I said, fuck it, and went to Python.

726
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It was much easier.

727
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Maybe a notebook, like Jupyter.

728
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I remember when I started a year ago.

729
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Everything was OK, but now it's really good.

730
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's well integrated, it's easy to use, and it's top-notch.

731
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The machine learning aspect is much more developed in Python than in R.

732
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
As I said, statistics were made in R.

733
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
In Python, you don't have the capacity to work with specific statistics like in R.

734
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You have very complex statistical models,

735
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
which are mostly used by specialists,

736
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and in Python they're not, or if they are, they're poorly implemented.

737
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You have a lot of work to do.

738
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
When I calculate a model in Python, I call it a plot,

739
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and the diagnostics tell me that it's not in Python.

740
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You mean in R?

741
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yes, in R.

742
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Not yet.

743
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
In Python, the computer science part is used,

744
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and it's not focused on diagnostics.

745
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In statistics, we're the stickler for the rules.

746
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You have to look at the assumptions first,

747
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and it's very important to have that.

748
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
In some aspects, Python is a bit behind,

749
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
but I'm convinced that in some aspects, R needs a lot more.

750
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
When I found out we were going to film this,

751
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I thought, what are you going to watch in these debates?

752
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You're going to watch YouTube and write Python vs R,

753
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and you're going to watch those videos,

754
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and it was good for me, because it's very relaxed,

755
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and it's a community.

756
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's not a question of one or the other,

757
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
but the answer is yes.

758
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The basics are so simple,

759
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
that it's easy to understand,

760
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and if you need a specific domain,

761
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you can look at it in both languages.

762
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
For me, the visual part of R was very interesting,

763
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
when you look at it like Python,

764
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
because it's really...

765
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The matplotlib is terrible.

766
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Typically, all the data is filtered,

767
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and it's hard to keep track of it,

768
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
because it's so rigid.

769
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So, those who are listening to us,

770
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and are now tacticing whether to watch one or the other,

771
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I think the answer is yes.

772
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Maybe we could go a bit back,

773
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and a bit forward.

774
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You work for the company Genialis.

775
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Not Genitalis.

776
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Can you tell us a bit about what you do there?

777
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
For example, what are you doing,

778
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
what is your job, what is your mission?

779
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Can you tell us a bit about what you do?

780
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Any data scientist, statistic, whiz?

781
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Magic, black box.

782
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then I come out and nobody knows what happened.

783
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I was going to say, why are you crying, but yeah.

784
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm not crying because I'm fulfilling my mission.

785
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Strictly speaking.

786
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Genialis is a company

787
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
that was established

788
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
by one of my colleagues.

789
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They were biologists,

790
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
biologists and mathematicians.

791
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The last thing we did,

792
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the last pivot,

793
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
was to focus on

794
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
solving cancer problems.

795
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And then we had a debate,

796
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
how can you tell your grandmother what you are doing?

797
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
If it's a ceramic, it's not a problem.

798
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But sometimes it's a bit harder,

799
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
because we help our partners

800
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
to solve cancer problems.

801
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
For example, you can imagine

802
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
that cancer is not one disease.

803
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's many diseases.

804
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
One cancer, which in the past

805
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
was thought to be one,

806
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
is not the same disease.

807
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And the medicine we have

808
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
against cancer

809
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
works for healing one cancer,

810
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but not for all patients.

811
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It works for 80%, 50%,

812
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
maybe even less.

813
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Those who heal themselves against cancer,

814
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
go through a cascade of treatments,

815
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to heal themselves.

816
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And when you get to the 3rd or 4th position,

817
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you don't have much time left.

818
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And it's very important

819
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
to know if the next therapy will work or not.

820
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
For someone who doesn't have much time left,

821
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
it's very important to know

822
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
if they try this,

823
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and if it will heal or not.

824
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
For example, we try to develop

825
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
a tool that will tell you

826
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
if it will heal or not.

827
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So that you don't waste your time

828
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
with something that we know

829
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
or suspect will not be effective.

830
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It can be an added value.

831
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
One added value is that you are healthy,

832
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and the other added value is that you know

833
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
if you will respond to a treatment.

834
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
When I go to the office,

835
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I think about it,

836
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and when I come back,

837
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I think about something else.

838
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
As a data scientist,

839
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
you get your input

840
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
with some data,

841
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
such as DNK,

842
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
or other data that you can use

843
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
to make predictions.

844
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yes, we tell you some facts

845
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
that we hope we will learn

846
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
from a daily record.

847
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
In our company,

848
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
we mainly deal with DNK data.

849
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Our cells have DNK,

850
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
which is the daily record

851
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
that is passed down from generation to generation.

852
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The result of this DNK

853
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
are proteins.

854
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The appropriate level is RNK.

855
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This is when you copy the pattern

856
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and go to someone with this pattern

857
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
to make this protein.

858
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We know how many patterns

859
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
there are for a single protein.

860
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The more patterns there are,

861
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the more proteins are produced.

862
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We know how to copy this part

863
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
to some extent.

864
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
On the basis of this,

865
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
our team tries to develop

866
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a model

867
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
that will be a product.

868
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I mentioned interdisciplinarity.

869
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We have Fruity,

870
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
we have physics, biotechnology,

871
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
we have biology,

872
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
computers, etc.

873
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The approach is multidisciplinary

874
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and only one person

875
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
can do this.

876
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You need a team.

877
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
As you said,

878
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
junk in, junk out...

879
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I can write that on my T-shirt.

880
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
If we sample DNK,

881
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
RNK,

882
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
it's a whole process.

883
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The whole process of collecting

884
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and digitizing it.

885
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This is what happens

886
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
at the beginning of production.

887
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
For development,

888
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
you can use archival data.

889
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's not necessary.

890
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The patterns we get

891
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
are...

892
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Are you looking for a political speech?

893
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
No, no.

894
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Are they big?

895
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Is it a JPEG format?

896
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
A gigabyte file per person?

897
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Or is it a terabyte of data?

898
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
One form of data we get

899
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
is a text file

900
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
which is 2x2GB.

901
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
DNK is a helix

902
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
with two legs.

903
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
DNK is a helix

904
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
with two legs.

905
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
DNK is a helix

906
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
where you choose one and the other.

907
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Each goes to its own file.

908
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It can be just one,

909
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but that's very specific.

910
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
These files can be small,

911
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
depending on the technology.

912
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You can have a special type of technology

913
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
for collecting very specific things.

914
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You can get a whole genome

915
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
in one file.

916
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That's a 50-100GB file.

917
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Of course, there are other approaches.

918
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
How do you do that?

919
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Let's give him a smart question instead.

920
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I went to a few workshops

921
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
for machine learning,

922
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
but the problem is

923
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
that you get a lot of data

924
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and then you try to reduce

925
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
that amount of data

926
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
to make it useful for learning

927
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
or for the model.

928
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Then you filter it out

929
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and you can't do it like in high school

930
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
where you had to measure

931
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
how valuable the data was.

932
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
When I was at the ML workshop,

933
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I realized that

934
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you have to filter the data

935
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
to know what it is

936
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and then reduce it

937
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
to make a model.

938
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
The part where you write

939
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
the model,

940
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
for example,

941
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
the machine learning model,

942
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
it's not that important.

943
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
There are a few parameters

944
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
that you create,

945
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but we dealt with pre-processing data.

946
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Do you deal with that in your work?

947
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Do you reduce it

948
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
or do you deal with the pro-model?

949
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
My answer will be twofold.

950
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
When I studied statistics,

951
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
both before and after,

952
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
when you look at the books

953
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that I mentioned,

954
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
you have a notebook

955
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and you make a model.

956
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That's how it is.

957
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
More than 20% of the work

958
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
is data injection.

959
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's a time sink.

960
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You can use it endlessly

961
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
to inject the data.

962
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's a big problem.

963
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
On the other hand,

964
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
when you get the data,

965
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
even if it's huge,

966
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
you can't share it on a laptop.

967
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
When you handle it on a platform,

968
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
you just upload a sample,

969
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
generate a pipeline,

970
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and that's it.

971
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Two hours later,

972
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
you have to invest in automation.

973
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That's a big problem.

974
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
A lot of tools are written in Python

975
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and they are not fully optimized.

976
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
However,

977
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
if you wanted to do it in Rust,

978
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
it would take a lot of time

979
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and you might not have the knowledge.

980
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Most of them are open source programs

981
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
that have already been confirmed

982
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
by the community

983
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to do what they are supposed to do.

984
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
A lot of people have used it,

985
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
it's proven,

986
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and you want to use it.

987
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You want to use your tool,

988
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
even if it's faster.

989
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It's a very complex algorithm

990
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and it's hard to fork it.

991
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You do it when you can afford

992
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
to do it.

993
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Until then,

994
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
it will take 5 instances.

995
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
For example,

996
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
when I was working in the previous service,

997
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
we analyzed the data.

998
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It took me a week.

999
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
If you could parallelize it,

1000
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
it would take 3 hours.

1001
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
A lot of optimization can be done

1002
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
to parallelize it,

1003
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
but above all,

1004
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
you need to feed the files,

1005
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
because the disk is so big.

1006
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
People are so fast.

1007
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
For example,

1008
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
when I was working in the Biology department,

1009
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
people were analyzing the data

1010
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and suddenly realized how big it is.

1011
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
They got 10 samples and now it's full.

1012
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It's a platform that handles it.

1013
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
As I said,

1014
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
we get huge files

1015
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and through these algorithms

1016
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
we reduce it from a few gigabytes

1017
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
to 200 kilobytes.

1018
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Then it goes to modeling

1019
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
where no magic happens.

1020
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Are these vectors?

1021
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
No, they are labels.

1022
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Labels and genes.

1023
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's one type of data.

1024
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
There are others,

1025
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
but most of them are individual labels.

1026
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
These are labels with a few samples

1027
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and a lot of genes.

1028
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The human genome has 50,000 genes.

1029
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
50,000 columns.

1030
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's different from

1031
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
what the partner has access to.

1032
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If you work in a studio,

1033
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
you can get 10 samples at the beginning.

1034
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That's not much for such a thing.

1035
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But it's very hard to get samples.

1036
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's expensive.

1037
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's relatively expensive.

1038
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Of course, it's not a lot.

1039
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But getting people to be prepared

1040
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and to be able to handle it

1041
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
is very interesting

1042
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
in the field of clinical studies.

1043
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
You see what the real problems are

1044
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and how to convince people

1045
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
to participate in your studies.

1046
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So that you can start.

1047
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Clinical studies take place in larger phases.

1048
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
One, two, three, and so on.

1049
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You have to recruit people.

1050
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's hard sometimes.

1051
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
People die, I hope,

1052
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
but they can leave.

1053
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
For example,

1054
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
in this field,

1055
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
in ecology,

1056
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
it's a very similar problem.

1057
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You have a limited season.

1058
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You imagine that one butterfly flies

1059
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
only one week in a year.

1060
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You can't recruit that many.

1061
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
You recruit them,

1062
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
you wait for a new season,

1063
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
but you don't get the data in time.

1064
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It seems to me that there are challenges

1065
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
in the whole science.

1066
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
On the one hand,

1067
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
you can get data quickly,

1068
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
you don't have to process everything,

1069
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
but on the other hand,

1070
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
you have to use tweezers.

1071
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Zadnic, I know you announced

1072
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
that you are looking for

1073
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
a data scientist for Genialis.

1074
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I saw that you had a job ad,

1075
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and we talked about it.

1076
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm just wondering

1077
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
if it's hard to find a data scientist

1078
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
that has a good idea for work.

1079
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Are you looking for a biologist

1080
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
or a statistician,

1081
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
or a mathematician?

1082
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Which line can prepare you

1083
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
for such a challenge?

1084
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It helps a lot to have domain knowledge.

1085
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
You can learn it quite quickly.

1086
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I assume that everything is possible,

1087
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but it's much easier.

1088
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I haven't tested the hypothesis yet,

1089
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
but I think that if you get someone

1090
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
with the biological knowledge,

1091
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
you can teach them to program it.

1092
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
On the other hand,

1093
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
if you have a computer scientist,

1094
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
it's full of basics,

1095
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
but there's also domain knowledge.

1096
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'll give you an example.

1097
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Someone from Slovakia has been studying

1098
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
for four and a half years,

1099
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and it's very difficult

1100
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
to pay off that four years

1101
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
with half a year of education.

1102
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,600
I think that's the direction, and I also think that my co-workers are very mathematically and linguistically primarily illustrated,

1103
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,600
and they learn how to program.

1104
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:23,200
We have a lot to compete with, we are very lucky, I really have excellent co-workers,

1105
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,200
and I feel the most comfortable in this world, and they are really exceptional,

1106
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,200
so we are really lucky to be able to lead such a team.

1107
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:41,200
In addition to being able to lead a good team, I think we also give back a lot,

1108
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:48,200
and we have a lot of foreign students, and we try to portray these juniors,

1109
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
to direct them,

1110
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,200
so I think we are unique, no matter how many people there are,

1111
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,200
because I often hear that in some meetups.

1112
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,199
I don't know, for us, we are lucky to be able to fill these positions.

1113
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:12,199
You will ask him the same question about the Python meetup,

1114
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:15,199
how did it work out for you?

1115
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,199
Maybe we will go to the pool of water, and Andraž will formulate the question.

1116
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,199
It's a question we had several times.

1117
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:37,199
You are active in the Python community, and you are the co-organizer of the Python meetup,

1118
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:46,199
and we talked about how difficult it is to find sponsors for the Python meetup.

1119
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,199
What do you think about that?

1120
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:58,199
It wasn't like that, we talked a lot about the Python meetup,

1121
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,199
and I know that people are asking where the next Python meetup will be,

1122
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,199
and if Python is really widespread, and a lot of people use it,

1123
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:10,199
I know that you are looking for sponsors,

1124
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:14,199
because if we don't have a Python meetup, we won't sponsor it.

1125
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:21,199
Why is it so difficult to get backing for something that big?

1126
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,199
It's really not difficult, if you are so little engaged.

1127
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,199
For example, I've noticed that it's unproductive to say,

1128
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,199
come to the meetup, come to the company,

1129
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,199
so that you can be a sponsor.

1130
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,199
You don't get anything.

1131
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,199
When you get to know the person, you start talking,

1132
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:47,199
you come to sponsor them, and then it really happens.

1133
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:52,199
I think that in the past, money wasn't such a problem,

1134
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:56,199
that it was a jump change for a company.

1135
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:03,199
Sometimes it's a problem to get a sponsor,

1136
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:05,199
sometimes it's not.

1137
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:09,199
So I think it's a bigger problem.

1138
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,199
The problem is in the organizers, because we are a bit lazy.

1139
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:19,199
It's not our primary job, and then I have to work 8 hours a day,

1140
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,199
and then I have to work from home,

1141
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,199
and then I have to call a new company,

1142
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,199
or hire a new person,

1143
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:28,199
and then you have to postpone it,

1144
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:30,199
because it's not your primary job,

1145
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,199
and then you have to wait for something to happen.

1146
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:35,199
Then people come to you and say,

1147
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,199
we would like to have a talk,

1148
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,199
and we would like to sponsor you.

1149
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:44,199
It's possible, really possible.

1150
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:46,199
As you said, it's a big community.

1151
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,199
I think that at meetup.com,

1152
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:53,199
it's probably the biggest computer community in Slovenia.

1153
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:56,199
I think that 1300 members,

1154
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,199
or something like that,

1155
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:00,199
compared to others, it's a lot.

1156
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,199
It also has some history.

1157
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,199
Yes, people started before me,

1158
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,199
and now we have our own history.

1159
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,199
I have a very bad memory,

1160
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,200
so if you've listened to the podcast Metamorphose,

1161
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,200
you know what I'm talking about.

1162
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I came there in 2016,

1163
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
and it was more than a year ago.

1164
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Do you have a feeling that this community

1165
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,200
has an influx of young beginners?

1166
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,200
Yes, to some extent, I think they are coming.

1167
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,200
They have their own members,

1168
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
and then sometimes new people

1169
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
come out of the vault.

1170
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,200
For example, they have a lecture

1171
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,200
or they know how to say something smart.

1172
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,200
The point of a meetup

1173
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
is the community itself.

1174
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
I think I'm learning a lot.

1175
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,200
These lectures are fine,

1176
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,200
but the energy they give you,

1177
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,200
and then the pizza at the end,

1178
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,200
and when you talk,

1179
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,200
you can honestly say something,

1180
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,200
or they say something,

1181
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,200
and the community,

1182
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,200
because sometimes you see

1183
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
that the university is looking for this,

1184
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
and you know it,

1185
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
and you connect,

1186
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,200
and it's an added value.

1187
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,200
I would recommend people

1188
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,200
to come to meetups.com,

1189
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
if they haven't yet.

1190
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
I'm looking forward to the next one.

1191
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,200
Recently you promoted

1192
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
or helped to organize

1193
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
a meetup called R-Ladies.

1194
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Can you tell us more about it,

1195
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
because I also saw

1196
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
that you helped.

1197
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
If I go one step back,

1198
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
when I was still working

1199
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
in biology,

1200
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,200
there were a few of us,

1201
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
and when we were working in R,

1202
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
we started to hang out.

1203
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
We were working in R,

1204
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
and we started to hang out,

1205
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
and we were like,

1206
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
let's meet up again,

1207
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
and we did,

1208
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
and then we said,

1209
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
and now we have a good name,

1210
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
we said that we are alcoholics,

1211
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
and then we started

1212
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
to organize lectures,

1213
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
and the first lecture

1214
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
that I had,

1215
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
in the biggest lecture hall,

1216
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
was full,

1217
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
and a lot of people were interested

1218
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
in what R was,

1219
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
because everyone was talking about R.

1220
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
It's like sex,

1221
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
everyone says they do it,

1222
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
but they don't really do it,

1223
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
they just choose a topic.

1224
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,200
Or public tests.

1225
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,200
And there was a lot of

1226
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
attention to it,

1227
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
and then it became a thing,

1228
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,200
and then I went there,

1229
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
with a fax,

1230
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,200
and then that.

1231
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
That was the main problem

1232
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
of getting lecturers.

1233
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
You have so many researchers

1234
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
at BfA,

1235
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
and they work hard,

1236
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
and they teach everyone

1237
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
from what they have,

1238
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,200
and then they run out.

1239
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
And R-Ladies

1240
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
is more

1241
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,200
at the beginning,

1242
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,200
with the new

1243
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,200
generation,

1244
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,200
or what do you call it?

1245
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
Yes, and then we have

1246
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
the alcoholics,

1247
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
we also have a Slack channel,

1248
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
and some people

1249
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
got together there,

1250
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
and one girl said,

1251
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
what if we had an R-Ladies meetup,

1252
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
which is a worldwide initiative,

1253
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
where different places

1254
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,200
around the world have

1255
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,200
chapters,

1256
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,200
some chapters,

1257
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
and they organize

1258
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,200
where girls or

1259
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,200
women

1260
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
talk about what they do,

1261
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
and when you watch those videos,

1262
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
you choose what

1263
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,200
they do.

1264
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
And also in Slovenia,

1265
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
we have a few

1266
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
entrepreneurs,

1267
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,200
and I help them a bit,

1268
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
as much as I can,

1269
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
but the main thing

1270
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,200
is that I am

1271
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,200
a part of it.

1272
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,200
Can you tell us

1273
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
about

1274
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
maybe

1275
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
a few institutions,

1276
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,200
or companies, or organizations

1277
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
that you know use R-Ladies in Slovenia?

1278
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Just for the feeling.

1279
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,200
Yes, for example...

1280
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
I don't know,

1281
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
startups, or big companies,

1282
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
small banks.

1283
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
The biggest company I know is

1284
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Univerza Ljubljana,

1285
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
which is our joint faculty.

1286
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
Maybe Teološka doesn't do it,

1287
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
but Philofax.

1288
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
If I try Philofax,

1289
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
I'll probably...

1290
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
SPSS?

1291
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
In Teološka as well,

1292
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
as Angelo Loka dances

1293
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,200
at the end of the needle,

1294
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,200
which was a question at the time.

1295
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
No, that's just a bad question.

1296
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
First of all,

1297
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,200
researchers from different institutions

1298
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,200
use R-Ladies a lot.

1299
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
I know that the biggest

1300
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,200
system bank in Slovenia

1301
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
also uses R-Ladies,

1302
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
among others.

1303
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
I think there are a lot

1304
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
of companies

1305
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,200
that are

1306
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
research-oriented.

1307
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,200
R is a fast tool

1308
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
to use.

1309
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Python is also

1310
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,200
a niche

1311
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,200
for itself.

1312
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,200
But I think

1313
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
R is very popular.

1314
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
Maybe I could sit down

1315
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,200
and start writing.

1316
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,200
I would be interested

1317
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,200
in how many users

1318
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,200
there are.

1319
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
You don't have to speak.

1320
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
I know, I know.

1321
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
You have more experience.

1322
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,200
We're already on the subject.

1323
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,200
You also record podcasts.

1324
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Yes.

1325
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
You said at the beginning

1326
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
that metamorphosis...

1327
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
We didn't say that.

1328
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,200
Let's go first

1329
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
to the sponsors.

1330
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
OK, let's go.

1331
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,200
This is a good clip.

1332
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
Here on the table

1333
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,200
we have stickers from Aurora Coworking.

1334
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
Aurora Coworking

1335
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
is

1336
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
a community space

1337
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
where we thank our guests

1338
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
for the opportunity

1339
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,200
to record

1340
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
in a slightly different setup

1341
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
than usual.

1342
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Thank you, Hosea and friends,

1343
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
for this opportunity.

1344
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
The company 3FSV and Human Frog

1345
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
have decided to support us

1346
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
this year.

1347
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
We thank them

1348
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
for making it possible.

1349
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
And of course Patreon,

1350
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,200
where we are also supported.

1351
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
We make ZDV easier.

1352
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Thank you to everyone who supports us

1353
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
and helps us to work.

1354
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,200
Let's move on.

1355
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
If you want to talk more with us,

1356
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
come to our Discord,

1357
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
where we can develop the topic further.

1358
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
I think you're also there.

1359
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
I'm also there,

1360
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
in the afternoon.

1361
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,200
I saw that.

1362
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
You can also

1363
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
ask questions.

1364
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,200
Is Human Frog like Human Fish?

1365
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Do they have beer?

1366
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Human Frog

1367
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
is a company

1368
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
from Žabec Group.

1369
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
They rebranded it.

1370
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
I think some companies did an acquisition

1371
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
and grew a little.

1372
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
They rebranded it.

1373
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
I won't say agency,

1374
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
but a whole suite

1375
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
of IT packages.

1376
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,200
It's easier with them.

1377
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
I wanted to record

1378
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
this podcast

1379
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
about metamorphosis.

1380
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
I listen to it a lot.

1381
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,200
I choose some

1382
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
scientific articles,

1383
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
but I choose

1384
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
news about science.

1385
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
AI is also very popular.

1386
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
Last year,

1387
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
there were a lot of algorithms

1388
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,200
for protein unfolding.

1389
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,200
Probably not folding,

1390
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
but OK.

1391
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
What did you say?

1392
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,200
Unfolding.

1393
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
People said

1394
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
that modern technologies

1395
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
are not really for humans,

1396
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
but they are really

1397
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
interesting.

1398
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,200
We all know chat GPT.

1399
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
One of them was protein folding.

1400
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,200
What do you think about it?

1401
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,200
Can you tell us something about it?

1402
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
Let's go back.

1403
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,200
I mentioned DNA.

1404
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,200
DNA is made of proteins.

1405
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,200
It's not just a record

1406
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,200
of amino acids,

1407
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,200
but it's also a form

1408
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,200
in which they are folded.

1409
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
It's a very complex process.

1410
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
It's very difficult

1411
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,200
to experimentally

1412
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,200
make it in a laboratory

1413
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,200
and then look at

1414
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,200
the 3D structure.

1415
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,200
You try to

1416
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
get closer to the ground

1417
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
and how would a computer

1418
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
teach you to

1419
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
input and output.

1420
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Then you learn

1421
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
how it unfolds.

1422
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Simulations are

1423
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,200
perfect for that.

1424
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
You try to tell

1425
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,200
how a protein

1426
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
is made.

1427
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
You make a DNA

1428
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
and you insert a bacterium

1429
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
in the cell

1430
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,200
to make a protein.

1431
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
You try to tell

1432
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,200
how it unfolds

1433
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
and then it unfolds

1434
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,200
depending on its function.

1435
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Will it fold or not?

1436
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,200
These big systems

1437
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,200
are used for that.

1438
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,200
You need a lot of

1439
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,200
computational power for that.

1440
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,200
If you are in a

1441
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,200
biotechnology industry,

1442
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,200
it's very difficult

1443
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,200
to develop

1444
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200
products

1445
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
like biodiesel.

1446
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
You want to split

1447
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
a protein to get more

1448
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
or less waste.

1449
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
These are very interesting technologies.

1450
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
I don't know

1451
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,200
how much

1452
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,200
the ROI is.

1453
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,200
How much is the return

1454
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
on investment.

1455
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
It's not my area

1456
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
so I'm not familiar

1457
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,200
with it.

1458
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
I've seen

1459
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,200
that it bends

1460
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,200
and it's a full breakthrough.

1461
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Yes, I know.

1462
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
It's easy to hear and see.

1463
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,200
I've read

1464
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
that people

1465
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
played games

1466
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
with folding

1467
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
and they got

1468
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,200
datasets.

1469
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,200
It's a very

1470
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
hardcore problem

1471
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
and it's difficult to develop.

1472
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,200
I think

1473
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,200
it's a bit obvious.

1474
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
I've been with you before.

1475
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,200
When we were talking

1476
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200
about what we would talk about,

1477
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
Brodo said

1478
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
that when

1479
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,200
the end of the world comes,

1480
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,200
he would go to Roman.

1481
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,200
He said, Roman is

1482
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,200
the one I want the end of the world to come to.

1483
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,200
I said, why?

1484
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
He said, Roman is the one

1485
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,200
who will be armed.

1486
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,200
He knows what's happening around him.

1487
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
The most important thing

1488
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
is to get to know each other.

1489
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
It will be a good company.

1490
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,200
It will be pleasant.

1491
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,200
There won't be any problems.

1492
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
Are you ready?

1493
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
I've got a haircut.

1494
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,200
Let's talk a bit

1495
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
about

1496
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,199
what you've been doing

1497
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,199
as a practicing data scientist

1498
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:11,199
in the research lab.

1499
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:13,199
Can you tell us

1500
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,199
why it's good to have

1501
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:17,199
your arsenal of weapons?

1502
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,199
You can tell us both.

1503
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:21,199
Is it supplemented?

1504
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:25,199
No.

1505
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:29,199
It's a different person

1506
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,199
who said I would have a sabre

1507
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,199
on a lonely island.

1508
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:39,199
I was relatively

1509
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:41,199
active in the lab.

1510
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:43,199
I'm still running

1511
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:45,199
all the time.

1512
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:47,199
I'm preparing what's going on.

1513
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:49,199
The stories are very interesting.

1514
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:53,199
My work started

1515
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,199
when everything started with Corona.

1516
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,199
Corona is a virus

1517
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,199
that was popular last year.

1518
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:01,199
Thank you.

1519
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,199
When everything started,

1520
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:07,199
we came up with an idea

1521
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:09,199
how to estimate

1522
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:11,199
the size of the virus.

1523
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:13,199
At the beginning, it was relatively small.

1524
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,199
I wrote a simulation

1525
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:17,199
where I estimated

1526
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,199
how many people

1527
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,199
could be tested

1528
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,199
in order to get

1529
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,199
the data.

1530
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,199
If you have a virus

1531
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:29,199
that is not yet

1532
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,199
detected at the beginning

1533
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:33,199
and is very small

1534
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,199
and difficult to detect,

1535
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,199
you need a lot of people

1536
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:39,199
to be able to detect it.

1537
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,199
100 people

1538
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:43,199
is nothing.

1539
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:45,199
In the end,

1540
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,199
you can't do anything.

1541
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:49,199
You can't do anything in the interval.

1542
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,199
That's why I calculated

1543
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:53,199
and put it on the Internet.

1544
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,199
Then I went to the FBI.

1545
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,199
They were

1546
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,199
a support

1547
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,199
for the people

1548
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,199
and they did

1549
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:05,199
the first study in the world

1550
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:07,199
where they estimated the prevalence

1551
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,199
of the virus in the population.

1552
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,199
They came to similar numbers as I did.

1553
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:13,199
That was a validation.

1554
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,199
Then I helped

1555
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,199
with the pipelines

1556
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,199
where the data was updated

1557
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,199
and then updated on the other side.

1558
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,199
It was more or less like that.

1559
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,199
At the meetings

1560
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,199
where I was involved,

1561
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,199
there were a lot of people

1562
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,199
and now someone else

1563
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,199
has to say something

1564
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:37,199
so that it's not a ping-pong game.

1565
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,199
The other 18 of us

1566
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,199
were on the bus watching the sky.

1567
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:43,199
A lover of efficiency.

1568
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,199
No,

1569
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,199
I feel

1570
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,199
the need

1571
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,199
to be pro.

1572
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:53,199
To be fair.

1573
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:55,199
I know they are intelligent

1574
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,199
and they have something to say,

1575
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,199
but it doesn't mean

1576
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,199
that you should

1577
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,199
step on someone's foot

1578
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,199
and then I say something.

1579
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,199
I am a pro.

1580
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,199
Roman is a real master.

1581
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,199
He doesn't know yet.

1582
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,199
That wouldn't be me.

1583
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,199
That was my instinct.

1584
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,199
It's a walk.

1585
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,199
Meetings for a tracker

1586
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,199
are in Bosnia.

1587
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,199
I'm used to it.

1588
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,199
I would have a meeting at 6 a.m.

1589
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,199
but I don't listen to it.

1590
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,199
Why not?

1591
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,199
If anyone

1592
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,199
wants to work with a tracker

1593
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,199
contact me.

1594
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,199
I'll find someone for you.

1595
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,199
Can you tell us

1596
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,199
about your arsenal?

1597
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,199
I've always

1598
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,199
been passionate

1599
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,199
about contraptions.

1600
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,199
I'm a geek.

1601
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,199
Not only in life,

1602
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,199
but also in weapons.

1603
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,199
It's a lot of fun.

1604
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,199
I've never had

1605
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,199
access to it.

1606
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,199
When I started making money

1607
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,199
I thought about

1608
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,199
...

1609
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,199
Sorry, what?

1610
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,199
I don't know.

1611
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,199
I was always passionate about

1612
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,199
contraptions.

1613
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,199
Then I bought a civilian version.

1614
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,199
Then you join a club

1615
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,199
and

1616
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,199
you go to meetings

1617
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,199
and competitions.

1618
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,199
It's a warning.

1619
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,199
It's a sausage fest.

1620
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,199
It's a very interesting sport.

1621
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,199
For me it's a weapon.

1622
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,199
I see it more as a tool.

1623
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,199
It's a loud gun.

1624
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,199
I'm fascinated

1625
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,199
by how it's made.

1626
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,199
For some weapons

1627
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,199
I make ammunition myself.

1628
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,199
Why do you get lost

1629
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,199
in it as a geek?

1630
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,199
How many bullets,

1631
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,199
how many bullets to shoot.

1632
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,199
It's a very good hobby.

1633
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,199
You can spend

1634
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,199
a lot of time on it.

1635
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,199
Yes, time sink.

1636
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,199
You can go back to it.

1637
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,199
Then you have people

1638
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,199
who pump their hair

1639
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,199
with bullets.

1640
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,199
It's a skill.

1641
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,199
In Slovenia

1642
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,199
it's still developing.

1643
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,199
Yes, it is.

1644
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,199
Do you think it's developing

1645
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:43,199
in Slovenia?

1646
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,199
I wouldn't say so.

1647
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,199
In Slovenia

1648
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,199
the third or the biggest

1649
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,199
organization

1650
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,199
are hunters.

1651
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,199
Everyone has a weapon.

1652
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,199
There are a lot of weapons in Slovenia.

1653
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,199
It's the same in subcultures.

1654
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,199
Hunters are a subculture.

1655
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,199
They have their uniforms,

1656
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,199
ties.

1657
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,199
The state helps you

1658
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,199
in hunting.

1659
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,199
Do you know what a hand is?

1660
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,199
Yes, it's called a deer.

1661
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,199
A hand is a sign

1662
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,199
of a deer.

1663
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,199
Do you know why it's called a hand?

1664
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,199
Because deer don't know

1665
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,199
the letter F.

1666
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,199
It's something you can

1667
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,199
somehow get into.

1668
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,199
It's not like you go to the door

1669
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,199
or the shooting range.

1670
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,199
For example, in Ljubljana

1671
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,199
we have a commercial shooting range.

1672
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,199
It's the easiest

1673
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,199
way to get to know someone.

1674
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,199
What are the biggest

1675
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,199
challenges?

1676
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,199
For example,

1677
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,199
someone who doesn't have

1678
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,199
any contact with the weapon.

1679
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,199
For example, someone who prepares it

1680
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,199
through American movies,

1681
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,199
media, etc.

1682
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,199
What is the biggest

1683
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,199
experience you have

1684
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,199
when you get to know

1685
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,199
the Slavic environment?

1686
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,199
Are we more regulated

1687
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,199
in Slovenia?

1688
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,199
Are we less regulated?

1689
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,199
Is it a problem?

1690
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,199
What are the technological aspects?

1691
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,199
I think that in Slovenia

1692
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,199
the weapon law is quite good.

1693
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,199
It's quite regulated.

1694
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,199
In the beginning,

1695
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,199
everyone can get a weapon

1696
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,199
for some reason.

1697
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,199
Again, if you are accused

1698
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,199
of committing acts

1699
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,199
related to violence,

1700
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,199
then they are cured.

1701
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,199
But there are a lot of people

1702
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,199
like that on other channels.

1703
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,199
I have a forum

1704
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,199
called Strelac.

1705
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,199
There is a thread

1706
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,199
where we put all the news

1707
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,199
from the area of

1708
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,199
weapons, shooting, etc.

1709
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
or at least in Slovenia.

1710
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And he's been doing this for, I don't know,

1711
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
10 plus years.

1712
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You're not on Stack Overflow, you're on Strelets.se, right?

1713
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yes, almost.

1714
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And it's

1715
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
very popular

1716
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and a lot, and one day

1717
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I'll take the time and go

1718
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
analyze it.

1719
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And I don't think it's a problem.

1720
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Of course, there are weapons

1721
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
involved in criminal acts, but I think it's

1722
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
like that.

1723
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
In the movie, they think it's a big deal,

1724
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
but it's really relatively small.

1725
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Especially with legal weapons.

1726
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
You should know that

1727
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
legal owners of weapons are like

1728
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
the police. We're afraid to do anything

1729
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
to get a lot of weapons.

1730
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
The same goes for hunters, for example.

1731
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And

1732
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
it's

1733
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
pretty common.

1734
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
My association with the movie is

1735
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
when they say

1736
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
what a shock you get when you come to the shooting range.

1737
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
It's

1738
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
a kind of indiscipline.

1739
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's not like

1740
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
waving your hand.

1741
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
The first thing you do is go home.

1742
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Even when you're at the shooting range,

1743
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
just to point at the gun,

1744
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
you aim at the gun.

1745
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
You just write it down and go home.

1746
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That's how it is.

1747
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
In the first place is security, in the second place is security,

1748
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
in the third place is security.

1749
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Then they start shooting.

1750
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I also think there's a lack of luck

1751
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
in our country.

1752
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Everything happens.

1753
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Hunters are unlucky

1754
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
because in the shooting range

1755
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
anything can happen.

1756
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
They bring you a bullet,

1757
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
or you hear gunshots

1758
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and someone shoots.

1759
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
That's what happened.

1760
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That's how it is.

1761
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Will you answer this question?

1762
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yes.

1763
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I found Balončko

1764
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
as a joke.

1765
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
For me it was great.

1766
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
One time we were riding a bike

1767
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
in a bar.

1768
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It was

1769
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
an amazing experience.

1770
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
You're like a log,

1771
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
very aware of things.

1772
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It was great when he said

1773
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Do you see that growing there?

1774
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
That's it.

1775
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It's an invasive species.

1776
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
We are getting...

1777
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I don't know, American

1778
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
or something like that.

1779
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
People are getting it

1780
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
and then they try to

1781
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
cut it out of the bar.

1782
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I know

1783
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
that there are also

1784
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
a lot of

1785
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
interesting activities

1786
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
that you do.

1787
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm so interested

1788
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
in what else

1789
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
you do.

1790
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
We often say

1791
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
we have to be eco-friendly,

1792
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
we have to take care of nature.

1793
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But there are also activities

1794
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
where you can get rid of invasive species.

1795
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Yes.

1796
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm interested in what

1797
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
things you do

1798
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
that are more

1799
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
activistically interesting than

1800
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
the asphalt on the ground.

1801
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
That's true.

1802
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
As a biologist,

1803
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
you have easy access

1804
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
to all the societies

1805
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
that exist in Slovenia.

1806
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
You have a lot of

1807
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
different activities

1808
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
that you can join.

1809
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
For example,

1810
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
it's great that

1811
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
a lot of people are interested

1812
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
in joining children.

1813
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
It's fun for the whole family.

1814
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You can also

1815
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
talk about botany.

1816
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You can go to a lake

1817
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
or a lake where botany

1818
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
is very interesting,

1819
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
or to the mountains.

1820
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You can also go to

1821
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Engolaš and back down

1822
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
to the city of Dajansko.

1823
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You can also see

1824
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
what's interesting outside.

1825
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You have a society

1826
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
that is involved with bees.

1827
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You have trips to different parts of Slovenia

1828
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and you register bees.

1829
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
A lot of photos

1830
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
with macro photography.

1831
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
You have beekeepers,

1832
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
as they are called.

1833
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You have a society that studies this.

1834
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
They also have competitions.

1835
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Who will be in more beekeepers

1836
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
in one day.

1837
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
You have bats.

1838
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
You have

1839
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
swans and

1840
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
swans.

1841
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Birds.

1842
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Birds are the biggest

1843
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
society in Slovenia.

1844
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
You probably heard about DOPS.

1845
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
They are also very active.

1846
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
They organize different events.

1847
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
They register swans,

1848
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
water birds.

1849
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
There is a lot of activity.

1850
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
There are a lot of good people

1851
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
who will gladly tell you

1852
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
anything.

1853
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
They will help you get involved.

1854
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You have a lot of books.

1855
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
You have a lot of books.

1856
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You have a lot of books.

1857
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You don't need more books.

1858
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
On your phone.

1859
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It is very nice.

1860
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
You have a lot of free time.

1861
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
You don't need a computer.

1862
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It is very accessible.

1863
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Slovenia is very lucky

1864
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
to have diversity here.

1865
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
People don't realize

1866
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
how much diversity we have here.

1867
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Different plants and animals.

1868
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
For example,

1869
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
in June,

1870
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I go to the grassland.

1871
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Not the best grassland,

1872
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
but an average good grassland.

1873
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
There are more species here

1874
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
than there are in the lowlands

1875
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
throughout the year.

1876
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The lowlands are flat.

1877
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
The vegetation and vegetation

1878
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
are all cut down.

1879
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It is relatively destroyed.

1880
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
If you go to the military training

1881
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
you have to wait.

1882
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I am dissatisfied.

1883
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
These are the best grasslands

1884
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
in Slovenia.

1885
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I have seen them.

1886
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
There are so many different plants.

1887
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It is a trip.

1888
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
If you are a fan of plants

1889
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and biology,

1890
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
don't miss it.

1891
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
When we go to the military training,

1892
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
we go to Maja,

1893
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
to Bloška Polica.

1894
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
You come up

1895
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
directly from the orchids.

1896
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Orchids are very endangered.

1897
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Some of them.

1898
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
But they are

1899
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
for sale.

1900
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Extensive grassland

1901
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
is cut down.

1902
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It is relatively polluted.

1903
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
That is what is destroying.

1904
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It is very interesting.

1905
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That is why in Slovenia

1906
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
people are so opposed

1907
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
to the military training.

1908
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It is really something extraordinary.

1909
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I know a few foreigners

1910
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
who got married

1911
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
because they were so upset.

1912
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Even with the women.

1913
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I have the same feelings.

1914
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That is a

1915
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
beautiful story.

1916
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
We could

1917
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
translate it

1918
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
into beer and food.

1919
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Life and food.

1920
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Life and food.

1921
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
You said

1922
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that you prepared a few questions.

1923
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I don't know if we gave you

1924
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
an opportunity to...

1925
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
No, no.

1926
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
We didn't touch

1927
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
all those topics.

1928
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Do you have anything else?

1929
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
No, one thing I thought

1930
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
we would find out.

1931
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
What is bioinformatics?

1932
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Exactly.

1933
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Roman is a bioinformatician.

1934
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
My name is

1935
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
senior bioinformatician.

1936
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I think

1937
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
when you look

1938
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
at the online definition

1939
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
of bioinformatics

1940
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
and how it is related

1941
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
to data science.

1942
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I think bioinformatics

1943
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
is just one part

1944
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
of data science.

1945
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
When

1946
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
computer scientists

1947
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
discovered statistics

1948
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
they called it

1949
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
data science.

1950
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
But it is really

1951
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
analysis of data

1952
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and everything related to it.

1953
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
From building

1954
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
infrastructure

1955
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
to modeling.

1956
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Bioinformatics

1957
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
is debated a lot.

1958
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I think

1959
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
when you dive

1960
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
into data science

1961
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
biological and molecular

1962
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
aspects

1963
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
you get bioinformatics.

1964
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Someone who has domain knowledge

1965
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
from biology

1966
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and programming.

1967
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
It is fast

1968
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and good enough.

1969
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
It is related to what we discussed

1970
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
before.

1971
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Someone with domain knowledge

1972
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
can learn to program

1973
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
fast and good enough.

1974
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Of course, it would be ideal

1975
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
for everyone to be a computer scientist

1976
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
and to know all algorithms

1977
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and RAST and C.

1978
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
But reality is

1979
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
that you have a week to do something.

1980
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I learn how to

1981
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
set up a location

1982
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
and pointers.

1983
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I want to click and get a picture.

1984
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
OK.

1985
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Roman, thank you for all your work.

1986
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Thank you for the organization

1987
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
of meetups

1988
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and events.

1989
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Thank you for your contribution

1990
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
to society in a technological

1991
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
way. Thank you, Andraž.

1992
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Thank you to the team in Grodno

1993
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for the recording.

1994
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Do you have anything else to say?

1995
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Thank you.

1996
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Thank you for the invitation.

1997
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
At first I said

1998
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I would come because I hoped

1999
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
there would be a VIP.

2000
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
But I don't see him yet.

2001
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Let's go somewhere else.

2002
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Thank you for your attention.

2003
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Thank you for your support.

2004
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
See you next time.

2005
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Thank you.

2006
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
See you at the end of the world.

2007
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
There will be me and Brodo.
