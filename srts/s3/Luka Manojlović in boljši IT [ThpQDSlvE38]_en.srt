1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What are your plans for the future?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He will be a journalist. At the beginning, he will talk for a couple of minutes about some stupid things that we talked about.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then we started talking, and at the beginning it will be Grodje Špica, and then we will start.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It will be very organic.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think that lately we are filming a lot outside of our normal setup.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, that is true, but on the other hand, if someone says to you that the biggest Slovenian technical conference is in Primorje, in Porto Rojo, in Bari, in Slovenia,

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
then in Primorje it will happen, it's hard to say no.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
When people say that, they ask themselves what they have been waiting for so long.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It is not clear to them what they are asking, but it's good.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Greetings to all of you who have joined us.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Specifically, from the 29th NTK conference, Luka Minojlović is with us.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He is one of the co-organizers of this event.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We were a bit worried about what would be the best moment for Luka to be stolen for this honor, for this speech.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He said before that he is the leader of the majority.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are the programming part, or rather the part where you attract the lecturers,

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
you create the hype, and then others join in.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Am I right?

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I would say yes.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What we are doing with our colleagues from this team is a work in progress.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We are getting lecturers from Slovenia and abroad,

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
some from the former state of Yugoslavia,

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and many from other European states, sometimes from the whole of America.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The conference is going on and on.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have been called so many times by lecturers who are experienced.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They don't come 10 minutes before the lecture, but one minute before,

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and then they set up an alarm where this person is,

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then we try to call him on all channels.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In the beginning, it is going on with its own pace and its own way, which is now verified.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me put it this way.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I am now a fourth-year student at NTK.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The beginnings are a bit different from other stories,

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but we will get to that.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How do you see this?

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What was NTK conference in the beginning,

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
let's say in the late 90s,

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and what is it now?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Where do you see yourself?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's say I am not a regular guest at this conference,

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but I see this Microsoft ecosystem,

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and this corporate scene.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now I have a feeling that there is a lot more freshness,

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
which includes open code.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's start with how Microsoft has changed.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There is more freshness, more small firms, startups,

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
open ideas.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know, you tell me.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think Microsoft ecosystem is very wide.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Their product range is very wide.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Microsoft was the main driver of the conference,

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
which is why it was named Microsoft.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They were looking at their products,

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
because Microsoft was interested in promoting their products.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
At the time, it was much more strict,

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
they were looking at other vendors,

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
if there is a partnership or a sponsorship slot

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
at these stages of the conference.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's been a long time,

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
since Microsoft is no longer in the spotlight.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We still protect the Microsoft ecosystem,

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and the audience, which is generally

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
transferred to the Microsoft platform.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But we are very happy,

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
if other technologies, other views,

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
or synergistic effects are stolen from us,

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
in combination with Microsoft.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Welcome to all content.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The conference was more product-oriented at the time.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Microsoft, with its big launches of new products,

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
also started a conference, which was very important.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think it's still very important,

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but it's a different time,

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and Microsoft has somehow missed

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
all the regional Microsoft conferences.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is no longer such an important focus for them.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I believe they are interested,

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
that this is still happening.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They got an opportunity from agencies,

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
which organize these events.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In the final phase, they also got an opportunity

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
from the community, which can now be seen at these conferences.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Microsoft has everything,

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
despite the fact that this community is perhaps less active

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
than it was 15 years ago.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They still choose very good experts from it.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They have a teacher,

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the backbone of these conferences.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
People with the name of MWP,

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
fans of technology,

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
entrepreneurs, and so on.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's still leaning on them.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They also have a generational menu for you,

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
plus they gravitate towards new technologies,

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
which makes me very happy.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's why you and your colleagues

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
might be talking to some other platforms.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm happy to hear your feedback,

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to join us and share your knowledge.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This conference has been going on for 29 years.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm here for the first time this year.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sometimes I wonder

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
how old it is compared to me.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, it is.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I've already been here with my new solo a while ago.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
When I heard about the brand Microsoft,

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
which organizes these conferences in Slovenia,

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I remember that a neighbor of mine

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
used to work in an IT department

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
of a Slovenian company.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know that she had a brand in Slovenia,

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
but I don't know if she still does.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
She had a nice bag,

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
a Microsoft logo,

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and I thought it was very interesting.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I've seen the Microsoft logo on Windows,

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
but I've never seen the Microsoft logo anywhere else.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can see it on a physical bag.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
People who work with Microsoft technology

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
get together.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's very interesting.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Today is a conference

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
organized by Windows and Microsoft.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We've been together for 30 years.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's interesting.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I still don't know the exact title of the MVP.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What does it mean?

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Does it mean Most Valuable Player?

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Professional.

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You were before Dončić.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Those are Dončićs in IT.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What does MVP mean?

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
MVP is a title

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
given by Microsoft

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
if it sees that you are active in the community

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and that you have an impact in the community.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You work on these technologies,

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you like to present them,

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you have an opinion.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's true that everyone finds

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the same personality

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
or the same area that is really cool for them,

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
where they can be more professional,

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and that's why they trust them more.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've seen certain Microsoft technologies

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and I'm still enthusiastic about them.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I like to present them.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In my time,

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
when I was 43,

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I was as enthusiastic as I was when I was 20.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I still believe that I stand for it.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If we present it, it will function as you wish.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I wouldn't say the same for every Microsoft technology,

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and I wouldn't stand for it either.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's true that the more you dig into it

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and get to know it in detail,

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the easier it is for it to work.

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I know you as a developer.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Microsoft has a lot of development tools,

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
but those developers who have worked

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
or are working in other environments,

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
probably haven't been so lucky

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
with this product range,

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and it's only normal

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to be the first one.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think that every computer

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
in Slovenia and beyond

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
has come to NTK once in a while.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Either way,

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
we're lucky here.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If nothing else, it's an event

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that you meet once a year,

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
even with those you really don't see.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's hard to find the time,

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
or maybe we forget.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's so beautiful to see it here.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This morning I met a guy

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't consider a guest,

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
but more of a guest than a speaker

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
who came to me and said,

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
where are you?

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Where are we going for a coffee?

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I noticed when you helped us

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
look for a parking lot.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When you go to these conferences,

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
people greet you and are very friendly.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't know if you know everyone by name,

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but it seems like you're a big group

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
of people you really know.

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
People really trust you

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and I see you have a lot of permanent guests.

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I think there are a lot of...

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We chose a term a while ago.

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
People who still have them are always sicker.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But I think there's a continuity

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
in your careers.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think it's done.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It doesn't just happen to me.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
As a teacher, I was the first

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
to embark on this path through Microsoft.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was a long time ago.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
A grant from Microsoft,

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
a grant for a sponsor called...

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
HUM.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can hear you, Vrhunsko.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can hear you, Vrhunsko.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It was a grant

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
focused more on

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
innovation in the office.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It was around 2002-2003.

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I had the challenge

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of installing the first DSL.

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
At the time, these modems were

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
jamming.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It was like pulling it out of an electrician

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and putting it back.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Today, it's called Watchdog.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I wrote Watchdog in Visual Studio,

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
which stopped a relay,

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
reset the modem,

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and called it Not Offline.

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was a student of musicology,

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
so I didn't know anything about it.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I hated that it was always on me.

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I got a second award.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The first one was from a colleague

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
who worked for Office.

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He later worked for Microsoft in the US.

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The award was to join NTK.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
At the time, it was a wow to me.

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was a wow to a rising student.

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
After NTK, a gentleman from Microsoft

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
called me.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He said,

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
where are you going to put NTK

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
in a show?

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't remember which year it was.

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It was for Exchange,

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
for the Microsoft 2007 system.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It was truly revolutionary

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
from Microsoft's point of view.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It had a lot of new features.

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was the first tool,

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
for Andraž, who was in a special class.

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It was the first Microsoft tool

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that you couldn't even install on a GUI.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You had to go to PowerShell.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It was very interesting.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I had a slot from 10.30 to 11.30.

248
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I thought I would have a slot from 10.00 to 11.00.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
In short, from 10.30 I went through the slides

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and from 2.00 to 11.00 I said,

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm done.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I forgot the whole slot in the slides.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I had a nice demo.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The hall was not too big,

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
so I could see what the new server was bringing.

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
One of the audience members said,

257
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you still have half an hour.

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I said, wow, half an hour and a demo.

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was totally into the demo.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I got very good ratings.

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There was an older gentleman,

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think he worked in a seminar in Ljubljana.

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He said, you have such enthusiasm,

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
so that was it.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Then Microsoft took me to Windows Server 2008,

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
which was a revolutionary Windows server

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
with a lot of new features and a totally different model

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
of operation than before 2003 or 2000.

269
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That was all day long.

270
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I said, wow, I've been doing this all day.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know how it is, 8 hours is enough.

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Then we repeated it more and more.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We were doing server presentations all over Slovenia.

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I remember Maribor, Ljubljana, Novi Gorica,

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and the whole of Kopru.

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We repeated it in Ljubljana,

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because it was very interesting.

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Microsoft got me into it.

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I started writing my blog,

280
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I was very active,

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and I was involved in meetings

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
with my colleagues who are a bit older than me,

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
for example Miha Pichler,

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and other colleagues like Matjaž Ladava,

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
who has been working at Microsoft in the US for many years.

286
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He was very important to me,

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
because he was from our end,

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
but he worked in Gorica,

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and he inspired us a lot.

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
When he saw that we were behind him,

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I got the name MVP,

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
if I go back to a simple question.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, of course, explain a bit.

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I got the name MVP,

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and I first went to Seattle.

296
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In Seattle, you sit with a product group,

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and older MVPs like you,

298
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
who have been there for 15 years,

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
talk about the difficulties of the server,

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
it's very interesting and educational.

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Does that mean that you devote yourself to Microsoft,

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
with MVP, or through that group,

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
you give some suggestions?

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So you always have a live connection with Microsoft.

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes, there are times when it's less,

306
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and times when it's more.

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
At that time, it was very intense.

308
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
During the pandemic,

309
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
we didn't know how to do it,

310
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
whether we were going to do it virtually,

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
or in person.

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Now, things are back to normal,

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and those who went to the Summit,

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I haven't been there for a few years,

315
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
are still participating,

316
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
if not, we have meetings,

317
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and if we comment,

318
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
they also have limited resources.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You have to look at things objectively,

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
my problem is probably not that big,

321
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and we have to deal with those compromises.

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
When I was younger, I didn't understand it,

323
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
now that I'm older, I understand it better.

324
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The resources are limited, priorities are set.

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
One of the things I noticed,

326
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
as a first-time person at an NT conference,

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
is that today there is no such day,

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
but people really go to the conference,

329
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but today there were a lot of people,

330
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
very well-dressed, very busy.

331
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't know which conference you go to.

332
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I know that at the B-Sides conference,

333
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
which Andraž organized on Friday,

334
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
probably more people came in hoodies,

335
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and favorite Pikachu T-shirts,

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but it seems to me that today

337
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
there were a lot of well-dressed people.

338
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If I understood correctly,

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the business aspect of the conference,

340
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
if we have a tech track,

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
where is the business aspect,

342
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
because I see that it is a very important part of the conference.

343
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes, on Wednesday, the second day,

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it is also dedicated to partners,

345
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and we also call it a business day,

346
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
which also has a special program.

347
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It is not so much a technological topic,

348
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
but a decision-maker,

349
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and a global vision that Microsoft has

350
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
through its products,

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
or topics that are trends in terms of leadership,

352
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
in terms of modern entrepreneurship, etc.

353
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Various topics are discussed,

354
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
women in IT, etc.

355
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But today there are definitely

356
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
a number of people present,

357
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
those who are here because of the technological lectures,

358
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and those who are here because of the business impact.

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
A number of partners and sponsors are present here,

360
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and it is certainly an important element

361
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
in terms of the development

362
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
of future businesses over the summer.

363
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Of course.

364
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If you have here,

365
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
everyone who has mentioned IT in any way,

366
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
including us,

367
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
why not create a business here?

368
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
There is probably some synergy,

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
some partnership,

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
why not use it here?

371
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It is definitely not a bad idea.

372
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I would like us to go

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
to a conference like this one,

374
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and maybe

375
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
change a thought

376
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
that I had with one of the participants today.

377
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He came from

378
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
a large Slovenian company,

379
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
not very large,

380
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
but relatively large for Slovenia,

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and he said,

382
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
we have a budget for education,

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
our stack in the company is Microsoft,

384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
everything we have in the company is Microsoft stack,

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and we are invited to this conference

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and education over the summer.

387
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We are here today to learn,

388
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to talk to professionals,

389
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
to see what is new in the field.

390
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In our organization,

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
for example,

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
we use Windows,

393
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
which is a default workspace

394
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
for many Zune organizations,

395
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and it is a fully-dominated

396
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
IT world.

397
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I hope that today we will come

398
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
to an IT conference like this one,

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
because...

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Sorry, go ahead.

401
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Finish your thought.

402
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Luka started well,

403
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
but for me it is musicology,

404
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and enthusiasm,

405
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you are full of enthusiasm,

406
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
a very positive person,

407
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and a very positive approach.

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In addition to the community,

409
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
it is all a volunteer,

410
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
enthusiastic thing.

411
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
In the final phase,

412
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you also found a job,

413
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
a career,

414
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and you are actively engaging with it.

415
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Keep it up.

416
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And here is the thing,

417
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
all IT is visible to us.

418
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I had the opportunity to see

419
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
how IT is done in a few companies.

420
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You said it much more elegantly.

421
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I know.

422
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You went straight to the point.

423
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What I wanted to say yesterday,

424
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and it would be great to talk to Luka,

425
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
is that IT is really

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
in such a low voice today,

427
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
if we look at it from the point of view

428
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
of the public administration,

429
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
IT firms,

430
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and Luka will present it in a very positive way.

431
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Or am I wrong?

432
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, you know,

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I came to the conclusion

434
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that maybe it is necessary

435
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
to keep IT together.

436
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Not Slovenian.

437
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes, it is possible.

438
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It is like Andraž's spinning top.

439
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Slovenians have very good spinning tops,

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
but we have a lot of them,

441
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and each one for himself.

442
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The greatness is in knowing how to cut it.

443
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It all started differently.

444
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
My grandfather was an electrician.

445
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
He was educated in Italy.

446
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I was an electrician out of love,

447
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
so I was fixing televisions all day long

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
for various people,

449
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
even though he was retired later.

450
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Computers were an addition to it.

451
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
My father, who saw that I would play too much games,

452
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
decided to buy a computer

453
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
that was too powerful for current games.

454
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I had a 486 100 MHz,

455
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
which was full, but only 4 MB RAM.

456
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So you couldn't do it.

457
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Then at some point you raised your hand.

458
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Suddenly the 486 was installed as an operating system,

459
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and then I got interested in it.

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's get back to the main topic.

461
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:12,280
I learned that it's better to learn less and help each other more,

462
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,799
to cooperate and to learn, because Slovenia is full of exceptional graduates,

463
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,080
truly exceptional. Andraž and I had the opportunity to meet them at the Lockchill competition,

464
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,799
and even though, by the way, when I went to musicology in Ljubljana,

465
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,040
I was helping a computer guy at Filofax when I was a student,

466
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,639
and I remember that at Filofax, there were public computers,

467
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:45,279
because not every computer had one, so you could surf the Internet on a public computer.

468
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,160
I remember that one day I was in Cleta, and I lived in Rimska, which is right next to Filofax,

469
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,680
and I took a carrier that didn't have Wi-Fi,

470
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,439
and it had a modem, and a network, but it had a PCMCI card,

471
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:02,240
so I had to call a taxi.

472
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,680
So, I went there in the middle of the afternoon,

473
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,800
to check my e-mails, and to download what I had downloaded during the day,

474
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:19,239
because we didn't have the Internet in our apartment.

475
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:26,040
But, I wanted to say that this community concept was very close to me,

476
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,959
because it started with me visiting CyberPipa in Ljubljana,

477
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,959
and I met him there for the first time.

478
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,879
We got to know each other, and he stayed in my mind,

479
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:38,199
and even after all these years of meeting him again,

480
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:41,320
I knew that he was the one for me.

481
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,279
And this CyberPipa was such a great concept for me,

482
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,559
because they were putting a monitor on top of each other,

483
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:51,879
and he was overlapping, and his colleagues were doing the same.

484
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,879
And it was so good for me.

485
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,879
I was active at the club of students in Goris,

486
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:57,879
and I would never be here today,

487
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,879
if it wasn't for the club of students,

488
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:06,080
because the club of students in Goris was a very advanced club.

489
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,080
And we had a server at the club, and it was interesting for me,

490
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,080
because I kept this server and put it on top of each other,

491
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,080
and I put the first point of Wi-Fi,

492
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
and I didn't even have Wi-Fi in the Czech Republic,

493
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
it was completely unrelated to Wi-Fi,

494
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
it was sitting in a field, no one used it.

495
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,080
But, at the same club, we worked freely.

496
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
We were young, and we wanted to...

497
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,080
No, we were working on a magazine, radio, TV, festivals, concerts,

498
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
I don't know what we were doing,

499
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
and in that spirit, I also took over IT,

500
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
let's do it that way.

501
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Today, when I met Matjaž Ljadav, Miho Pichler,

502
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
that there are some Slovaks in Ljubljana,

503
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
that they meet here at Microsoft,

504
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,080
three lectures, half a pizza and a beer.

505
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Oh, the best!

506
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,080
And all of this is voluntary,

507
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,080
and together we talk, we exchange ideas.

508
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
When I started writing a blog,

509
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
I know that someone from Goris told me,

510
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
hey, don't do that,

511
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
you know, you're spreading knowledge,

512
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,080
and they will help you with your blog.

513
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,080
If that was the case, then I wouldn't have a blog.

514
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,080
On YouTube, we don't need to talk to each other,

515
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
because everything that you know,

516
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
and what you know, and what I know,

517
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
and what he knows,

518
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,080
is recorded dozens of times on YouTube,

519
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,080
in the sense that, if someone wants to do something,

520
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
in any field of our three,

521
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
good, they can do it.

522
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
But, you see,

523
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
there's another factor.

524
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,080
A human factor.

525
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
And when we talk about public administration,

526
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
about the weaknesses of the ethics,

527
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
we know how it feels.

528
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
And he loves his job, he enjoys his job,

529
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,080
he really manages it with enthusiasm and zeal,

530
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,080
or is it his job where he's been unhappy for 15 years?

531
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
We don't know.

532
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,080
And that's why I'm responsible for not taking over.

533
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
We don't know what people are doing,

534
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
they can be underpaid, they can be dissatisfied,

535
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
they can have their own difficulties,

536
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
they can enjoy it, it's a full factor.

537
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
And it doesn't change the job.

538
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
If you work in a computer,

539
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
in a certain period of time,

540
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
now you have to work for five weeks.

541
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
These are very big things.

542
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,079
But in the computer, there's another factor.

543
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,079
We have an ego with these computers.

544
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,079
It grows over the years.

545
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,079
It grows over the years,

546
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,079
but we have to know how to manage it, I think.

547
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,079
If we manage big systems,

548
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,079
and networks, and code,

549
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,079
and GitHub, GitLab...

550
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,079
I would say...

551
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,079
I think it grows over the years,

552
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,079
but you can also let it go over the years.

553
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,079
You can put that ego aside.

554
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,079
I agree.

555
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,079
When you say it's a connection,

556
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,079
it can't happen if the ego is gone.

557
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,079
Of course.

558
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,079
And that's something that's fully present in the computer.

559
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,079
I remember a lecture.

560
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,079
At the time, someone jumped out of the audience.

561
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,079
He was like,

562
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,079
that's the other product.

563
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,079
I get it.

564
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,079
We're here to talk about this solution.

565
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,079
Someone can come and say,

566
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,079
I know everything.

567
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,079
There's something for everything.

568
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,079
We can compare it.

569
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,079
And we can see that the other thing

570
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,079
has something much better.

571
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,079
OK, we're at it now.

572
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,079
Let's focus on that.

573
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,079
It's not like that anymore.

574
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,079
It was also a good school for lectures.

575
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,079
When I'm in heaven,

576
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,079
I sit down to breathe,

577
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,079
and then react.

578
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,079
This is my experience.

579
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:35,079
I'm connected to NTK.

580
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,079
I don't know.

581
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,079
NT4 was the last version

582
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,079
I had controls with.

583
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,079
And then,

584
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,079
I switched to Linux,

585
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,079
and then Unix,

586
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,079
and everything was connected to Unix.

587
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,079
And that's how it was.

588
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,079
That ego thing.

589
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,079
Linux vs. Windows.

590
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,079
And because of that,

591
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,079
there was a big rivalry.

592
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,079
I would say,

593
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,079
we're not going to hang out

594
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:05,079
with these people.

595
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,079
It's like the whole war

596
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,079
is going on.

597
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,079
I never imagined

598
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,079
that one day

599
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,079
we would be

600
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,079
dealing with the same people

601
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,079
on NTK.

602
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,079
And we would be

603
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,079
on the same page.

604
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,079
If you think about it now,

605
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,079
20 or 30 years ago,

606
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,079
was it really like that?

607
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:33,079
Today,

608
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,079
the ecosystem is totally different.

609
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,079
Yes, it is.

610
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,079
For the audience,

611
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,079
so we don't lose them

612
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,079
when we go way back,

613
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,079
I would like to say

614
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,079
that I compiled

615
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,079
a lot of stuff.

616
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,079
In high school,

617
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,079
we had some C-sharp

618
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,079
tasks,

619
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,079
and we had to do that.

620
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,079
And the whole vibe

621
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,079
was on C-sharp, Visual Studio,

622
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,079
.NET.

623
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,079
And how do you deal with that?

624
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,079
If you use a mono version,

625
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,079
0, 0, 1, 2,

626
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,079
whatever,

627
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,079
Miguel Decaza,

628
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,079
and then you compile it,

629
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,079
and you get a check.

630
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,079
So it's possible.

631
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:23,079
It's possible.

632
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,079
It's possible to be a player

633
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,079
in open source and

634
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,079
with Microsoft technologies.

635
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,079
And definitely,

636
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,079
the mono contributor

637
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,079
is now working on .NET

638
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,079
and is employed by Microsoft.

639
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,079
And now that .NET is developing,

640
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,079
we all know that it's more open source

641
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,079
and in different platforms.

642
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,079
And definitely,

643
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,079
new people, new ideas,

644
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,079
new economy, new collaborations.

645
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,079
People know that it's the way to go.

646
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,079
And we will definitely work more.

647
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,079
As you can see,

648
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,079
this shift that happened,

649
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,079
it's a community,

650
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,079
a community that came

651
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,079
to Microsoft.

652
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,079
This is just the leadership,

653
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:08,079
which has changed a lot.

654
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,079
A lot of people

655
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,079
with open hands

656
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,079
and now we have open source.

657
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,079
And last but not least,

658
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,079
GitHub became a Microsoft product.

659
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,079
I didn't buy it.

660
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,079
No, I sincerely believe

661
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,079
that it came from all,

662
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,079
not from the risk community.

663
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,079
Because I remember

664
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,080
a lecture

665
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
from ten years ago

666
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
when we started using PowerShell

667
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
a little more,

668
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
2012, 2013,

669
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
which was given to me

670
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
by a woman,

671
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
in the sense of some

672
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
system administration.

673
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Once I was joking

674
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
and you will see

675
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
that Windows Server 2.20

676
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
will be in a riot.

677
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
And today,

678
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
we have a lecture

679
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
where Windows Server 2.25

680
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
will be,

681
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
but the virtual machines

682
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
will be Microsoft Linux 3.0.

683
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
It will be able to spin

684
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
the virtual machines quickly.

685
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
On the other hand,

686
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
the virtual machines

687
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
can do a lot of other things.

688
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
I think that the transition

689
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
to the cloud took a long time.

690
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
It was necessary to find

691
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
an alternative

692
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
to Microsoft's

693
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,080
crazy basics

694
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,080
to be able to run

695
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,080
something too simple

696
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
and lightweight.

697
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,080
The use of energy,

698
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
storage, all these things,

699
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
all these factors,

700
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
I think, have forced Microsoft

701
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
to look for alternatives

702
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
where it would be possible

703
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
to enable all this storage

704
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
with some other platform.

705
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
When I was in Dublin,

706
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
in the data center,

707
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
they were shocked

708
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
that one of their main concerns

709
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
was how much computing

710
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
for how much energy

711
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
was needed to run

712
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
a Windows Server.

713
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
It was also necessary

714
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
to simplify the carriers

715
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
of today's computers.

716
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Why would a Windows Server

717
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
run on a small container

718
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
for women,

719
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
if it could run on

720
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
a Linux or some other platform?

721
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
And it would be better

722
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
and more performant.

723
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,080
I think it was connected

724
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
with the overall development.

725
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
I don't know.

726
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
I won't even

727
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,080
get too close to it.

728
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
It could be.

729
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,080
I congratulate you

730
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
that it could be.

731
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
It could be just the opposite.

732
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
You won't have a Windows subsystem

733
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
for Linux,

734
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
but you will have Linux subsystem

735
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
for Windows.

736
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Why not?

737
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
It could happen.

738
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
There's nothing wrong with that.

739
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Hyper-V...

740
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Can you tell us

741
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
what does Hyper-V mean

742
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
to me?

743
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Hyper-V, in my opinion,

744
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
is a very good virtualization platform

745
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,080
for those who bought

746
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
a Windows Server

747
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
and got it out of the box.

748
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
And for those who run

749
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Windows virtual machines.

750
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
That's why Hyper-V is an excellent platform

751
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
because it enables

752
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
everything that big companies offer.

753
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Yes.

754
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
There are a lot of other players

755
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
from free to commercial ones

756
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
that offer something more.

757
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Especially in the field

758
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,080
of special features

759
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,080
that probably

760
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
90% of Windows ecosystems

761
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,080
don't need.

762
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Or

763
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
specific

764
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
for workloads.

765
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Now you have Linux

766
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
which is better.

767
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Last year,

768
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
VMWare had a virtualized machine

769
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
running faster than bare metal.

770
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
That was a marketing

771
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
move.

772
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
But,

773
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
yes,

774
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
there are platforms that

775
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
are better than Hyper-V

776
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
because it has its overhead.

777
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
I've been using it

778
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
since it was very, very easy.

779
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
In 2008,

780
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
it was Hypervisor that couldn't

781
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
be trusted.

782
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
It had some limitations,

783
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
memory slots,

784
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
CPUs, disks, etc.

785
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
But over time,

786
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
it developed into a nice

787
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
virtualization platform.

788
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Do you already

789
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
pay for PowerShell

790
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
or do you click on it?

791
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
It depends

792
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
if I click on something trivial.

793
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
For example, today,

794
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
when I set up a demo

795
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
I always use PowerShell

796
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
because it's not smart to click

797
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
on each virtual disk,

798
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
repeat it, and then

799
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
you call me and say

800
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
let's go.

801
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
I think it's better

802
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,080
to automate and script

803
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
and so on.

804
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
I think PowerShell

805
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
doesn't have to worry

806
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
about typical Windows

807
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,080
repositories.

808
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
They're already quite familiar with it.

809
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
I have a forum on Windows machines.

810
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm totally illiterate

811
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
in Windows machines.

812
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Maybe that's why

813
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,080
there are so many questions.

814
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,080
He's changing his job

815
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
and if he doesn't choose

816
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Mac or Windows,

817
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
maybe he'll get a job

818
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
on Windows.

819
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
I have to answer

820
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,080
that I have no idea

821
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
how it works.

822
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
I don't know where we are

823
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
and how it works.

824
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
I know there must be something

825
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
but I really don't know.

826
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,080
What I'm interested in

827
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
when I look at

828
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
your pages

829
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
and what Loki tells me

830
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
about his pages,

831
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
I have an exceptional

832
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
and unique opportunity

833
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
to meet a guy

834
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
from IT

835
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
and healthcare

836
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
from non-Windows environment.

837
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Loki works in healthcare

838
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
and healthcare homes

839
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
IT in this segment.

840
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,080
We have you.

841
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
If I understand correctly,

842
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
you also work a lot

843
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
for healthcare homes and IT

844
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
in healthcare as such.

845
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
I really wanted to talk

846
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
about this topic and get

847
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
something interesting out of it.

848
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Because as a user

849
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
of healthcare and healthcare

850
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
in Slovenia,

851
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
it seems to me

852
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
that you could have done

853
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
a lot better.

854
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Sometimes I'm shocked

855
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
when something doesn't work

856
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
and I'm like,

857
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
why doesn't it work?

858
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
I'm just curious

859
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
what challenges you see

860
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
and what you've experienced

861
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
in Slovenian IT and healthcare.

862
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Can you tell us more about it?

863
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
You can start, Loki.

864
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
I know you don't like it,

865
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
but go ahead.

866
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
I'll try to think

867
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
and not judge.

868
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
I see

869
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
the classic problem

870
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,080
of lack of resources.

871
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
I think

872
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,080
that, of course,

873
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
there are financial resources

874
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,080
for certain things,

875
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
but I also see

876
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
human resources.

877
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
I think that healthcare

878
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
is very undernourished.

879
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,080
If you have

880
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,080
an IT institution,

881
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
it's usually one

882
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
that controls

883
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
and is actively involved

884
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
in the work.

885
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Now it's abandoned,

886
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
it's overrun

887
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
or divided into parts.

888
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
I think that

889
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,080
the environment is

890
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
so non-stimulating,

891
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
that if a person

892
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
has so much

893
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
intelligence,

894
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
he will eventually

895
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
lose it and go

896
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
to a less stressful job.

897
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I had the opportunity

898
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
to see a lot of

899
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
good people

900
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
who left the sector

901
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
because they were

902
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
too busy.

903
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
I won't say

904
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
what happened next,

905
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
but with some passion

906
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
and enthusiasm

907
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
it's possible to create

908
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
a solution that would

909
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,080
drink water,

910
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
that would digitize

911
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
our healthcare system.

912
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
But,

913
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
I don't know,

914
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
that was my part

915
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
that I had the opportunity to see.

916
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,080
I agree with that.

917
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Maybe I would add

918
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,079
that communication

919
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,079
is a big problem

920
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,079
for those people

921
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,079
who work in this sector.

922
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,079
They either have a hard time

923
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,079
expressing their difficulties

924
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,079
or they are

925
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,079
less engaged

926
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,079
in communication.

927
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,079
I often see

928
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,079
that you don't trust yourself.

929
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,079
You don't trust

930
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,079
to try

931
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,079
to activate something,

932
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,079
to improve everything.

933
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,079
What if it doesn't work?

934
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,079
Let's test it tomorrow.

935
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,079
Let's pick a day when it's not so busy.

936
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,079
Let's try to do it

937
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,079
in an isolated way,

938
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,079
in a more secure way.

939
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,079
I often see things

940
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,079
in the same place.

941
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,079
Let me give you an example.

942
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,079
There are

943
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,079
a lot of softwares.

944
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,079
I'm coming back to

945
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,079
a generational leap.

946
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,079
In a lot of households

947
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,079
older softwares

948
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,079
that started

949
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,079
to be built

950
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,079
at the end of the 90s

951
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,079
are still being built

952
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,079
on the same basis.

953
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,079
We know that

954
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,079
there are a lot of modern

955
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,079
softwares and security softwares

956
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,079
that are probably

957
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,079
being reduced.

958
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,079
But there are a lot of

959
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,079
new add-ons,

960
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,079
new programs.

961
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,079
I think that

962
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,079
these software houses

963
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,079
are probably not able

964
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,079
to make a cut,

965
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,079
develop a new software

966
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,079
and replace it.

967
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,079
This, on the one hand,

968
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,079
gives an opportunity

969
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,079
to new software houses

970
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,079
to come up with

971
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,079
some modern concepts.

972
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,079
I don't think

973
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,079
this is an infrastructure problem.

974
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,079
We have too little hardware

975
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,079
and the main problem

976
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,079
is the software we use.

977
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,079
I don't like it

978
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,079
for these reasons.

979
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,079
I think that

980
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,079
these new solutions

981
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,079
will be removed.

982
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,079
Moving from one software

983
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,079
to another is stressful

984
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,079
not only for the computer.

985
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,079
A healthcare worker

986
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,079
will spend three minutes

987
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,079
every month

988
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,079
using a software

989
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,079
if it is not

990
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,079
an intuitive software.

991
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,079
Maybe that is why

992
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,079
there is a demand

993
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,079
for these software houses

994
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,079
to be reassembled.

995
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,079
These are not

996
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,079
some office users

997
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,079
who, even now,

998
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,079
if the day before

999
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,079
their shift in Bosnia

1000
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
is over,

1001
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,079
they have to catch up.

1002
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,079
No, these are healthcare workers,

1003
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,079
nurses,

1004
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,079
people who are sick

1005
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,079
in front of their doors.

1006
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,079
Not healthy people

1007
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,079
who can wait,

1008
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,079
but healthy people.

1009
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,079
These are sick people

1010
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,079
who have a fever, a headache,

1011
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,079
etc.

1012
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,079
These are different situations.

1013
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,079
I remember that

1014
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,079
at some point

1015
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
something happened

1016
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,079
and I was called

1017
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,079
by a nurse.

1018
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,079
She told me that

1019
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,079
I should rest

1020
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,079
because I was 35 minutes

1021
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,079
behind the car.

1022
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,079
If I can catch up,

1023
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,079
I will be there in 35 minutes.

1024
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,079
So, you need to prepare

1025
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,079
a mechanism to manage

1026
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,079
these people.

1027
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,079
The other thing is

1028
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,079
communication.

1029
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,079
Also from the side of us,

1030
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,079
IT people.

1031
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,079
It is a bit like

1032
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,079
going back to Uniego.

1033
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,079
This is a very advanced question.

1034
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,079
Did you learn this?

1035
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,079
Yes, I did.

1036
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,079
Or were you raised

1037
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,079
with this?

1038
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,079
I think that

1039
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,079
the skill

1040
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,079
of working with people

1041
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,079
is lacking.

1042
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,079
But you can survive

1043
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,079
if you don't have

1044
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,079
a phlegmatic

1045
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,079
in the IT environment.

1046
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,079
If all of this

1047
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,079
causes stress,

1048
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,079
you will get sick.

1049
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,079
But some people

1050
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,079
suffer from this.

1051
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,079
I understand this.

1052
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,079
My colleagues don't worry too much.

1053
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,079
They don't trust everyone.

1054
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,079
There is also

1055
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,079
an education

1056
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,079
on how to use computers

1057
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,079
in a safe way.

1058
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,079
We need to

1059
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,079
be aware of this.

1060
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,079
If you compare yourself to IT people,

1061
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,079
what kind of a scene is this?

1062
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,079
Where do we live?

1063
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,079
It is like a garden.

1064
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,079
A radiator won't work.

1065
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,079
What kind of fears are these?

1066
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,079
IT people are like you.

1067
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,079
Let's go to those who have

1068
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,079
better skills in communication

1069
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,079
and not to those who are

1070
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,079
in the wrong direction.

1071
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,079
That is why

1072
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,079
healthcare is so specific.

1073
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,079
It is not an ordinary

1074
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,079
company.

1075
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,079
That is why these programs

1076
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,079
are so important.

1077
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,079
I would like them to be

1078
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,079
intuitive and

1079
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,079
to enable me to do

1080
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,079
what they do.

1081
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,079
Do you think that

1082
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,079
if there were more

1083
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,079
computers,

1084
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,079
it would encourage people

1085
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,079
to upgrade,

1086
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,079
to have better security policies,

1087
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,079
to have better planning?

1088
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
Let me give you

1089
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,079
a plastic example.

1090
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,079
Is it possible to regulate

1091
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,079
your daily routine?

1092
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,079
You have

1093
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,079
an electronic

1094
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,079
wallet

1095
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,079
from a patient

1096
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,079
and you have a system

1097
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,079
where you can log in

1098
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,079
and have a look up and down.

1099
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,079
You have a PDF.

1100
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,079
What if someone

1101
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,079
sends you an e-mail

1102
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,079
about complications?

1103
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,079
How do you deal with that?

1104
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,079
If you have set yourself

1105
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,079
a standard,

1106
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,079
we need a system

1107
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,079
that has a traceability

1108
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,079
to look at things.

1109
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,079
If he has the opportunity

1110
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,079
to transfer it and

1111
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,079
send it via e-mail,

1112
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,079
he can also send it

1113
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,079
via his Gmail.

1114
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,079
It is very difficult.

1115
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,079
As you mentioned,

1116
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,079
there are

1117
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,079
programs

1118
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,079
that are developing

1119
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,079
and there are things

1120
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,079
that...

1121
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,079
I had an example

1122
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,079
when we were building

1123
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,079
an e-mail cluster.

1124
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,079
We said that

1125
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,079
inbound and outbound

1126
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,079
e-mails are not monitored.

1127
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,079
When you send

1128
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,079
an e-mail,

1129
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,079
the e-mail must be

1130
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,079
by default.

1131
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,079
We had a project

1132
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,079
in 2020 or 2022.

1133
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,079
We tested

1134
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,079
all the ideas.

1135
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,079
In the end,

1136
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,079
we realized that

1137
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,079
the analysis that you send

1138
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,079
sends an e-mail

1139
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,079
and doesn't support the task.

1140
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,079
Now,

1141
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,079
communication with the producer

1142
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,079
is done from the e-mail.

1143
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,079
These are things

1144
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,079
in their legacy

1145
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,079
that didn't exist

1146
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,079
in the design.

1147
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,079
Now, you can catch it.

1148
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,079
These are things

1149
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,079
that, as you said,

1150
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,079
we don't get a black screen.

1151
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,079
Where is the beginning?

1152
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,079
Is there a problem on the network?

1153
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Ok, they send you an e-mail.

1154
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,480
So, yes, there are a lot of things going on.

1155
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,240
And now, because of IT, sometimes it's too late, sometimes I don't know.

1156
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:20,080
Sometimes they change a cartridge in the printer, someone is looking for a phone, and then someone tells them that there is an investigation going on.

1157
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,080
Well, that's also a very important aspect.

1158
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,080
That's also why I believe they don't deny it.

1159
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,160
Because I know that in the past there were trends, where companies came, for example, an IT company, they went around,

1160
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,160
and then they explained to other companies, for example, at one time they came, and then they did a thorough inspection of the environment,

1161
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,160
and then they gave some of their guidelines, right?

1162
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,160
A lot of data.

1163
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
All right, all right, right?

1164
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,160
And now they solve a machine that costs, I don't know, 200,000, 300,000 euros, which analyzes the cover,

1165
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,160
and doesn't know TLS, and what are we going to do now? Are we going to change the machine now?

1166
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,240
Look, honestly, it's unbearable.

1167
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
It's impossible.

1168
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,240
It's impossible to change.

1169
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
It's impossible to...

1170
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
I mean, what would that mean?

1171
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,239
It means that we would have to change those machines in, I don't know, I'm talking now, 8 to 10 years.

1172
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:10,239
If those machines, unfortunately, live for 20 years, right?

1173
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:17,239
Now, we have to be so flexible and understanding that, okay, we will be able to solve it with some other protocols.

1174
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,320
For example, I had an example of a software package that communicates with a database,

1175
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,320
and I made sure that it communicates plain text, more or less.

1176
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,320
And one day, I sniffed it out with Zorka, and I made sure that it can be understood.

1177
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,320
It can't be understood in plain text, but it can be understood, right?

1178
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,320
And then I asked them if it could be solved, and they were a bit shocked that it would be difficult,

1179
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,320
and that it would cost some money.

1180
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,320
And okay, we solved it in a different way.

1181
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:46,320
In the Windows environment, the IPsec between machines and servers is now really unbearable when it goes online, right?

1182
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,400
So, there are also some other alternatives, right?

1183
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,400
And that's what I imagined, and I also wrote a blog, and I saw a guide on how to implement such things,

1184
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:02,400
with which I can solve a problem that the machine can't solve, or the programmer's house can't solve,

1185
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,400
or I could even imagine an unforeseen cost that is too high for the organization, right?

1186
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,399
Because I also do that, you know, I would also do everything perfectly, right?

1187
00:52:11,399 --> 00:52:15,399
But unfortunately, we have to live in accordance with our abilities, right?

1188
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:20,479
And I think it's better that the nurses are paid better,

1189
00:52:20,479 --> 00:52:22,479
that they do their job better and are more satisfied,

1190
00:52:22,479 --> 00:52:25,479
or that they have better tools with which they work.

1191
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:31,479
So now I'm thinking that we have to replace that machine

1192
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:36,479
because I won't be able to do it, and that's why I did all this, right?

1193
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,479
So, it has to be done in a healthy way.

1194
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:42,559
And you have, you know, I'll ask you like this.

1195
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,559
Some kind of marketing slogan is

1196
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:50,559
all companies have become tech companies,

1197
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,559
some are disappointed, others are not disappointed.

1198
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,559
Do you have that feeling that these are not speakers who are disappointed,

1199
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,559
that they are very technological organizations,

1200
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,559
that this machine, as you said, costs 200-300 bucks,

1201
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,639
that the data is very sensitive,

1202
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:11,639
probably the most sensitive data that we all exchange,

1203
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:16,639
that, I don't know, in England we saw that before the cryptovirus,

1204
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:18,639
the whole hospital was closed.

1205
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:21,639
Do you have that feeling that we are not doing enough

1206
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,639
on, as I said, the education of decision-makers in these organizations?

1207
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:27,639
Do we give them enough opportunities?

1208
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:29,639
Are they good enough speakers?

1209
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,639
Can they push some agenda for change?

1210
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,720
Do we have the capacity, or are we really just going to put out fires?

1211
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,720
Because, looking at the output that I see as a user,

1212
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,720
I have a feeling that they are just putting out fires.

1213
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,720
I don't know, what do you think about that?

1214
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,720
Well, I can speak for the Novogoriška scene.

1215
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,720
I can tell you that the service for this is excellent,

1216
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,720
for more than 10 years.

1217
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,720
And that it is displayed to users every year, which is great.

1218
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,800
That everyone is asking questions,

1219
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,800
even if the management is not as technically capable,

1220
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
because it is not,

1221
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,800
but everyone is asking questions,

1222
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,800
they are discussing,

1223
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,800
and so on.

1224
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,800
I have warned about that a lot,

1225
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,800
just like Andraš said,

1226
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,799
don't send it to Gmail,

1227
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,799
or don't send it to your,

1228
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,799
or don't take a picture with WhatsApp and send it.

1229
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,799
Let's not do that,

1230
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,880
because we don't have much influence on that.

1231
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,880
What we do, we don't let it go,

1232
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,880
end-to-end encryption,

1233
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,880
I don't know what,

1234
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,880
we all love these platforms,

1235
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,880
but these platforms are not ours,

1236
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,880
we have nothing to do with them.

1237
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,880
And once sent, it's fine,

1238
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,880
that's the story,

1239
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,880
it's gone now,

1240
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,880
and we don't have much influence.

1241
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,880
I especially emphasize this for younger users,

1242
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,880
because now there are so many young people

1243
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,880
who find it difficult to choose

1244
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:55,959
and especially when it comes

1245
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,959
to the use of technology,

1246
00:54:57,959 --> 00:54:59,959
everything is changing for them,

1247
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:01,959
and they should be warned about it,

1248
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:03,959
not to scare them,

1249
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:05,959
I don't scare them,

1250
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:07,959
but I warn them,

1251
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:09,959
look,

1252
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:11,959
these applications are not suitable

1253
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:13,959
for this beginning,

1254
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:15,959
we have other ways

1255
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:17,959
to use them,

1256
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:19,959
even if it is a little harder,

1257
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:21,959
you will use these two clicks

1258
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,040
and you will be told

1259
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,040
that everything went through these platforms.

1260
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,040
But ok, I understand,

1261
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
there is a certain state in the country,

1262
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,040
I don't know how to manage it,

1263
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,040
ok, then people are self-organized,

1264
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,040
they make groups,

1265
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,040
ok, understandable,

1266
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,040
but now we are back to normality

1267
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,040
and let's go back,

1268
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,040
let's correct these protocols again.

1269
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,040
I don't have any problems with that,

1270
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,040
but I warned about one thing,

1271
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,040
that important services,

1272
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:52,119
such as health homes,

1273
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:54,119
municipalities and so on,

1274
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,119
and in my opinion,

1275
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,119
even if we work in the computer,

1276
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,119
we could have a small plan B

1277
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:02,119
in the case that the computer does not work,

1278
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,119
because we don't have to be so angry

1279
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,119
that we are not able to do

1280
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,119
most of the analysis

1281
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:10,119
that the computers do not do,

1282
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:12,119
in the extreme case

1283
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,119
and in some transitional period,

1284
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:16,119
it will not be forever,

1285
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,119
but let's say

1286
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
that we are able

1287
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,200
to work for a week

1288
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,200
in some way,

1289
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,200
but still satisfied,

1290
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
even in the case that the computer does not work,

1291
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,200
because I am someone,

1292
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,200
look, I like it,

1293
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,200
I like to work,

1294
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,200
I try to do my best,

1295
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,200
but attackers have 24 hours,

1296
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,200
and I just go to sleep,

1297
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,200
and it is not in this world

1298
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,200
that it is so much talked about

1299
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,200
and nothing will ever happen,

1300
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:48,279
and in this scenario,

1301
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,279
although remote,

1302
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:52,279
but I hear that it can happen,

1303
00:56:52,279 --> 00:56:54,279
and in my opinion,

1304
00:56:54,279 --> 00:56:56,279
we need a day like that,

1305
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,279
it is not that we will have

1306
00:56:58,279 --> 00:57:00,279
hand pumps for water,

1307
00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:02,279
but we also have to think

1308
00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:04,279
about such things,

1309
00:57:04,279 --> 00:57:06,279
especially if we look globally

1310
00:57:06,279 --> 00:57:08,279
at what is happening in the world,

1311
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:10,279
the final phase,

1312
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:12,279
what happened in Gartner

1313
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:14,279
with the best software

1314
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:16,359
for protection of computers,

1315
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:18,359
what can happen

1316
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:20,359
in such a company,

1317
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:22,359
and where am I

1318
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,359
in the whole Gartner?

1319
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,359
I see

1320
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,359
in all our public institutions

1321
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:30,359
that

1322
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,359
during

1323
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:34,359
all this knowledge

1324
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:36,359
is happening

1325
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,359
through some stories

1326
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:40,359
like,

1327
00:57:40,359 --> 00:57:42,359
I don't know,

1328
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,440
in the hospital,

1329
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,440
these stories

1330
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,440
of how this happened

1331
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,440
are actively raising

1332
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,440
some alarms

1333
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,440
that we need a disaster recovery plan,

1334
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,440
because in the end,

1335
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,440
even if you want

1336
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,440
to close your business,

1337
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,440
and not continue

1338
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,440
to close it,

1339
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,440
they will say,

1340
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,440
okay, but have you prepared

1341
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,440
a scenario?

1342
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:12,519
As you said,

1343
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:14,519
all the knowledge

1344
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:16,519
is passing through time,

1345
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:18,519
things are being given

1346
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:20,519
to some roadmap,

1347
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:22,519
the question is

1348
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:24,519
if we are already there,

1349
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:26,519
if we are ready,

1350
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:28,519
if we are actively working on it,

1351
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:30,519
but

1352
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:32,520
if, I don't know,

1353
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
if I use this segue,

1354
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
you are also actively involved

1355
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,599
in the Lock Shield project.

1356
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:46,599
What did this project

1357
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:48,599
give you,

1358
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,599
in the sense that

1359
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,599
you said, hey,

1360
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:54,599
these are some very good practices

1361
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,599
that I started to use myself,

1362
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,599
because all of us

1363
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:00,599
who came from there,

1364
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:02,599
I won't say that we know it all,

1365
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:04,599
but we had an opportunity

1366
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:06,599
to see the environment,

1367
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,679
and we were well prepared,

1368
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,679
and we were still surprised.

1369
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:12,679
What is something

1370
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,679
that you pulled out

1371
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:16,679
and said, hey, I started

1372
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,679
to use my side,

1373
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:20,679
and automatically,

1374
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:22,679
it's not like that,

1375
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:24,679
good practices are being used.

1376
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:26,679
And before you answer,

1377
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:28,679
EPP.

1378
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:30,679
Let's thank our sponsors,

1379
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:32,679
3FSA, Humelfrog, Caldio,

1380
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:34,679
and all the Patreons that support us

1381
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,760
in these episodes.

1382
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,760
Before I pull out the Lock Shield,

1383
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,760
tell us what Lock Shield is,

1384
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,760
please, for those who don't know what it is.

1385
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,760
That's all. Thank you.

1386
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,760
I've never heard of it.

1387
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,760
Andraž will help.

1388
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,760
It's a branch

1389
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,760
of cybersecurity,

1390
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,760
where you train

1391
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,760
in an environment

1392
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,760
that is already compromised.

1393
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,760
The environment is trying

1394
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,760
to fix itself and defend it

1395
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,760
against future attacks.

1396
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,760
A bunch of countries are participating,

1397
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,760
if I'm not mistaken,

1398
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,760
24-25 countries,

1399
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,760
mainly members of the NATO,

1400
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,760
but also some members of the association

1401
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,760
or some candidates.

1402
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,760
It's an exceptional experience,

1403
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,760
which was first

1404
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,760
fascinating to me,

1405
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,760
how much security

1406
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,760
Slovenia has in different areas,

1407
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,840
and how many young people

1408
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,840
are very talented

1409
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,840
and, I would say,

1410
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,840
very experienced are there.

1411
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
Every day,

1412
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,840
when I returned home

1413
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,840
after the war,

1414
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,840
I didn't sleep in Ljubljana,

1415
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
and every time I came home

1416
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840
I thought,

1417
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,840
we have to do this,

1418
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,840
we have to do this,

1419
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,840
we have to do this.

1420
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,840
I prepared a lecture

1421
01:01:00,919 --> 01:01:02,919
at some of the conferences

1422
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:04,919
where I repeated

1423
01:01:04,919 --> 01:01:06,919
that we don't talk

1424
01:01:06,919 --> 01:01:08,919
too much about security

1425
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:10,919
in Serbia,

1426
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:12,919
what is publicly

1427
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,919
announced is announced,

1428
01:01:14,919 --> 01:01:16,919
we don't go into too much detail,

1429
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:18,919
and with this lecture

1430
01:01:18,919 --> 01:01:20,919
I didn't touch

1431
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:22,919
what would affect

1432
01:01:22,919 --> 01:01:24,919
the security,

1433
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:26,919
but only some of the mechanisms

1434
01:01:26,919 --> 01:01:28,919
that we used.

1435
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I didn't say

1436
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
that we don't see them

1437
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
in the field.

1438
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I have been in Ljubljana

1439
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
for a long time,

1440
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and I was inspired

1441
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
when I saw

1442
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
how the problem

1443
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
started to arise,

1444
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
that you are not blind

1445
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
to everything,

1446
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
that you see

1447
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
what is going on

1448
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
in all areas.

1449
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,080
The beauty

1450
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,080
of this field

1451
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,080
is that there are

1452
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,080
real attackers,

1453
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,080
and the attackers

1454
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,080
are actually people

1455
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,080
who start it.

1456
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,080
It is not a simulated

1457
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,080
or a script,

1458
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,080
but these people

1459
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,080
can repeat

1460
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,080
different things

1461
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,080
in different hours.

1462
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,080
In short,

1463
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:27,159
you have to react

1464
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,159
according to your abilities,

1465
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:31,159
because it is also nice

1466
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:33,159
that you can't carry

1467
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:35,159
all your tools,

1468
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,159
all your most expensive products

1469
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:39,159
that you have,

1470
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,159
but you work with a set

1471
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:43,159
that you like.

1472
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,159
I really like

1473
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:47,159
that we try to find each other

1474
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:49,159
with some experience, knowledge

1475
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:51,159
and cooperation

1476
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:53,159
in the final phase.

1477
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:55,239
It is a very good experience

1478
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,239
from my side.

1479
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,239
If it is your sales

1480
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:01,239
in Zamesh

1481
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:03,239
in a few years,

1482
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:05,239
what is the next step

1483
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,239
when there are

1484
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:09,239
smaller companies

1485
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:11,239
that are getting better?

1486
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:13,239
You were on the Windows 10

1487
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:15,239
system,

1488
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:17,239
what is the next step?

1489
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:19,239
I think it is very banal

1490
01:03:19,239 --> 01:03:21,239
and you will say

1491
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,320
that we still don't see this

1492
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,320
in the companies.

1493
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,320
One thing is that

1494
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,320
we tried to screw up

1495
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,320
the Windows Firewall

1496
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,320
so that it can't be taken out

1497
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,320
and nothing can be done.

1498
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,320
Only those policies

1499
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,320
that come from the central management

1500
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,320
can be applied.

1501
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,320
And this

1502
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,320
drastically reduces

1503
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,320
the potential attacker

1504
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,320
where he can

1505
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,400
attack.

1506
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
The second thing

1507
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
is logging.

1508
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
We are talking about Microsoft

1509
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,400
because I am the head

1510
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
of the Microsoft conferences

1511
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,400
in the region.

1512
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,400
In short,

1513
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,400
Microsoft has a very good

1514
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,400
central logging system

1515
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,400
that you rarely follow

1516
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,400
and on which

1517
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,400
you can build a system of alerting.

1518
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,400
It is impossible

1519
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,479
that IT doesn't know

1520
01:04:19,479 --> 01:04:21,479
that a new user has been created

1521
01:04:21,479 --> 01:04:23,479
in Active Directory

1522
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:25,479
and is not aware of it.

1523
01:04:25,479 --> 01:04:27,479
This is a banal example,

1524
01:04:27,479 --> 01:04:29,479
but IT colleagues

1525
01:04:29,479 --> 01:04:31,479
who work in Pentest

1526
01:04:31,479 --> 01:04:33,479
will tell you

1527
01:04:33,479 --> 01:04:35,479
that when they come to the location

1528
01:04:35,479 --> 01:04:37,479
and ask for the news

1529
01:04:37,479 --> 01:04:39,479
that we have created a user

1530
01:04:39,479 --> 01:04:41,479
in AD.

1531
01:04:41,479 --> 01:04:43,479
If IT doesn't know

1532
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,479
that a new user has been created

1533
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:47,559
I think that

1534
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,559
it is missing a lot.

1535
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:51,559
I have listed two things

1536
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:53,559
and there are a lot of others.

1537
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:55,559
But let's start with this.

1538
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,559
Back to basics.

1539
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,559
Windows Fire or Windows Vista

1540
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:01,559
will be better.

1541
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,559
Let's do this to the end.

1542
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:05,559
Let's do it on servers,

1543
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,559
on clients.

1544
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:09,559
You will see that

1545
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:11,559
we will feel much better.

1546
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:13,559
If someone wants to take

1547
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,640
a step forward

1548
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,640
you will be as good

1549
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,640
as you were when you started.

1550
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,640
People still think

1551
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,640
that everything is inside

1552
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,640
and we have everything.

1553
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,640
If we stop,

1554
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,640
we will have less trouble

1555
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,640
because everything will work.

1556
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,640
But then you get rid

1557
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
of a lot of other problems.

1558
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,640
Firewall is that.

1559
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,640
I would like to ask you

1560
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,640
this question.

1561
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:43,719
You have been a teacher

1562
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:45,719
for a few years now.

1563
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:47,719
What did you learn?

1564
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:49,719
I know that you didn't work

1565
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:51,719
on Windows desktops

1566
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,719
but you were more in

1567
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:55,719
a different field.

1568
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,719
I was in a few networks.

1569
01:05:57,719 --> 01:05:59,719
Now we are a bit

1570
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:01,719
off-guard.

1571
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,719
I know.

1572
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:05,719
There is a lot of work

1573
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:07,719
in the background.

1574
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:09,719
We talked about this

1575
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,799
a bit.

1576
01:06:11,799 --> 01:06:13,799
I just want to hear

1577
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,799
on the record.

1578
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:17,799
Something small.

1579
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,799
Something small.

1580
01:06:23,799 --> 01:06:25,799
My

1581
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:27,799
full

1582
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:29,799
experience

1583
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:31,799
is that

1584
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:33,799
if I go back

1585
01:06:33,799 --> 01:06:35,799
to communication

1586
01:06:35,799 --> 01:06:37,799
in IT,

1587
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,880
there is too little

1588
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,880
reasonable operation of the Internet.

1589
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,880
People

1590
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,880
who manage

1591
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,880
systems,

1592
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,880
I don't mean

1593
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,880
Windows system,

1594
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,880
which is the same problem

1595
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,880
for people who manage

1596
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,880
Linux servers,

1597
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,880
Kubernetes,

1598
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,880
etc.

1599
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,880
There is too little

1600
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,880
segmentation

1601
01:07:05,959 --> 01:07:07,959
or writing

1602
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:09,959
firewall rules

1603
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,959
what is allowed where.

1604
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:13,959
Sometimes

1605
01:07:13,959 --> 01:07:15,959
people know how to write

1606
01:07:15,959 --> 01:07:17,959
source

1607
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:19,959
with IP

1608
01:07:19,959 --> 01:07:21,959
from

1609
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:23,959
this port

1610
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:25,959
for this type of traffic

1611
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:27,959
and that is a lot.

1612
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,959
As soon as you realize

1613
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:31,959
that

1614
01:07:31,959 --> 01:07:33,959
they are mixed

1615
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,040
UDP, TCP

1616
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,040
it is all the same.

1617
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,040
There are IP addresses

1618
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,040
with very

1619
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,040
wildcard masks.

1620
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,040
This is

1621
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,040
something

1622
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,040
that we

1623
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,040
as people who work

1624
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,040
in the network,

1625
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,040
do not express

1626
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,040
in a very strong way

1627
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,040
that

1628
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,040
some users or administrators

1629
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,119
still do not know.

1630
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:06,119
It is the same

1631
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:08,119
as we discussed

1632
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:10,119
some episodes ago

1633
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,119
how developers

1634
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:14,119
still do not understand

1635
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:16,119
how the Internet works.

1636
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:18,119
There are some hardcoded

1637
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:20,119
words inside, etc.

1638
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:22,119
This is

1639
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:24,119
one of the problems

1640
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:26,119
that if you realize

1641
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:28,119
that

1642
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:30,119
someone

1643
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:32,199
who manages

1644
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:34,199
firewall

1645
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:36,199
must write

1646
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,199
a traffic engineering

1647
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:40,199
rule.

1648
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,199
It is easier for me

1649
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:44,199
if someone comes to me

1650
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:46,199
and says

1651
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:48,199
this is my type of traffic

1652
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:50,199
which is legit

1653
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:52,199
and it must be open

1654
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:54,199
so it looks like traffic.

1655
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:56,199
I can make

1656
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:58,199
a strict rule.

1657
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,280
If someone comes to me

1658
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,280
and says I have a service

1659
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,280
that must communicate

1660
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,280
with a satellite on the other side

1661
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,280
and I say

1662
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,280
where is that satellite?

1663
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,280
Can you show me

1664
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,280
in a vlog

1665
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,280
that I can do it

1666
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,280
without those who must understand everything.

1667
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,280
Sometimes

1668
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,280
it is not necessary

1669
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,280
to have a user on the other side

1670
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,280
who will understand you.

1671
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:28,359
Someone who is

1672
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,359
a manager

1673
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:32,359
or a maintainer

1674
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:34,359
of a service

1675
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:36,359
must understand

1676
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:38,359
how things work

1677
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:40,359
on that network level

1678
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:42,359
what must be open

1679
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,359
where are those

1680
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:46,359
tasks to function.

1681
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:48,359
I think

1682
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:50,359
that

1683
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:52,359
maybe

1684
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,359
it is clear to me

1685
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:56,439
and I don't have to expect

1686
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:58,439
that it will be clear to you

1687
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:00,439
but

1688
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:02,439
on that

1689
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:04,439
it is a task

1690
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:06,439
that I have a feeling

1691
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:08,439
that we tried in the first year

1692
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:10,439
and we thought that we succeeded

1693
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,439
and we tried in the second year

1694
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:14,439
and we see if it is necessary

1695
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:16,439
but it seems to me

1696
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:18,439
that it is easier

1697
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:20,439
to prepare

1698
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:22,439
but

1699
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,520
as Luka said

1700
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,520
if you start

1701
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,520
logging

1702
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,520
and you set up some central logs

1703
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,520
then you have a point

1704
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,520
of reference

1705
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,520
where you can start

1706
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,520
looking for who did something.

1707
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,520
If you don't have anything

1708
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,520
to learn

1709
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,520
it is very difficult

1710
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,520
to be blindsided

1711
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,520
because you don't know

1712
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,520
what happened

1713
01:10:50,599 --> 01:10:52,599
because I can say

1714
01:10:52,599 --> 01:10:54,599
that these are tasks

1715
01:10:54,599 --> 01:10:56,599
that we always learn

1716
01:10:56,599 --> 01:10:58,599
and we always learn

1717
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:00,599
how to do

1718
01:11:00,599 --> 01:11:02,599
very basic things

1719
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:04,599
but still

1720
01:11:04,599 --> 01:11:06,599
I don't want to say

1721
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:08,599
such a thing

1722
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:10,599
like

1723
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,599
guessing

1724
01:11:12,599 --> 01:11:14,599
but you have

1725
01:11:14,599 --> 01:11:16,599
tasks that come

1726
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:18,599
with some

1727
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,680
computers that are

1728
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,680
default

1729
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,680
or factory

1730
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,680
these are tasks

1731
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,680
that are easy

1732
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,680
to remove

1733
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,680
but still

1734
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,680
my question is

1735
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,680
do you see

1736
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,680
that last year

1737
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,680
there was a test

1738
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,680
where you did

1739
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,680
a clean install of Windows server

1740
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,680
and you put it on the internet

1741
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,760
and it took a long time

1742
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,760
to complete it

1743
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,760
in minutes

1744
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,760
and at the same time

1745
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,760
you installed Red Hat Linux

1746
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,760
without Firewall

1747
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,760
and you got it up

1748
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,760
do you see that

1749
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,760
Windows operating system

1750
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,760
is getting better

1751
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,760
that the default settings

1752
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,760
are so

1753
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,760
hardened

1754
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,760
that

1755
01:12:14,839 --> 01:12:16,839
you have to

1756
01:12:16,839 --> 01:12:18,839
do some tasks

1757
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:20,839
for example

1758
01:12:20,839 --> 01:12:22,839
I have a task

1759
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,839
where I work

1760
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:26,839
with a soft keyboard

1761
01:12:26,839 --> 01:12:28,839
and

1762
01:12:28,839 --> 01:12:30,839
I didn't give

1763
01:12:30,839 --> 01:12:32,839
a right to

1764
01:12:32,839 --> 01:12:34,839
share the screen

1765
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:36,839
but my Zoom

1766
01:12:36,839 --> 01:12:38,839
can't share the screen

1767
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:40,839
because by default

1768
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:42,839
there were only two

1769
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,920
do you see

1770
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,920
that Windows

1771
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,920
is getting better

1772
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,920
or not?

1773
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,920
Yes, definitely

1774
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,920
in the last time

1775
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,920
Microsoft is doing a great job

1776
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,920
and the default settings

1777
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,920
are closed

1778
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,920
if we are talking

1779
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,920
about Firewall

1780
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,920
and you have to

1781
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,920
open everything

1782
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,920
later

1783
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
there is an art direction

1784
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
we have a festival in Gorica

1785
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
where last year

1786
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
there was a guy who talked about

1787
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
defaultism

1788
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
he said that the phone is best

1789
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
installed when you come to the store

1790
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
to take it

1791
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
with the best sounds

1792
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and the best way to put everything

1793
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
because this default

1794
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
they probably overstudied

1795
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
that it is the best peeling

1796
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
and he talked about defaultism

1797
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,079
and he let people

1798
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:43,079
go to his Facebook account

1799
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:45,079
and opened it

1800
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:47,079
so that people

1801
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:49,079
can go inside

1802
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:51,079
and create there

1803
01:13:51,079 --> 01:13:53,079
in the past it was a disaster

1804
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:55,079
in Windows

1805
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:57,079
much worse than now

1806
01:13:57,079 --> 01:13:59,079
now you have a bunch of mechanisms

1807
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:01,079
that are already included

1808
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:03,079
or they came with some

1809
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:05,079
compatibility

1810
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:07,079
on different servers

1811
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,160
if you installed RDP

1812
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,160
brute force attack

1813
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,160
it will lock your account

1814
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,160
so it will warn you

1815
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,160
that you can't log in

1816
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,160
while you are in the console

1817
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,160
that you have to turn it off

1818
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,160
and that something is happening

1819
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,160
so these things

1820
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,160
Microsoft will take seriously

1821
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,160
I think it is not logical

1822
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,160
to look at the size

1823
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,160
and impact of these attacks

1824
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,160
that damage the whole economy

1825
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:37,239
if we go back to the other two things

1826
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,239
lock, shield

1827
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:41,239
one more thing

1828
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:43,239
we are doing things

1829
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:45,239
that we will need

1830
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:47,239
because when you are under attack

1831
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:49,239
you can't deploy in the monitoring system

1832
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,239
it will be a bit too late

1833
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,239
and probably other resources will be wasted

1834
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,239
this is one thing

1835
01:14:55,239 --> 01:14:57,239
another thing

1836
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,239
when it comes to Windows systems

1837
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:01,239
and networking

1838
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:03,239
it is also an interesting thing

1839
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
One day, one of my good friends, I teased him a little bit,

1840
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
in that way, I called him a lot of times, and I said,

1841
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Hey, is it possible to set the IP on the server 192.168.1.0.0.0?

1842
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
He said, no chance.

1843
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
What, 192.168.0.0.0.0.0?

1844
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I said, no, that's not a chance.

1845
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
We come to such things, when we laid out subnets,

1846
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
and I said, these are just two legitimate IPs,

1847
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
why can't I set them?

1848
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
But for a Windows system, that's completely taboo.

1849
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Also, probably on Linux,

1850
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
if you tell it where the zero is at the end of the IP,

1851
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
it will look weird, in my opinion.

1852
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
But, yeah, that's how I got started with it.

1853
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And I said, then I stopped, and I said,

1854
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
You know, that's a senior IT guy,

1855
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
he knows how to set up a Windows environment,

1856
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
whatever you want, just look at it,

1857
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
the network is a dot for us.

1858
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Here, too, in my opinion,

1859
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
that's between us,

1860
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
that network hub has always been a little bit stronger.

1861
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I have a feeling that the network wouldn't be,

1862
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
or rather, the internet,

1863
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
probably wouldn't be as successful as it is now,

1864
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
if it was more secure in the beginning.

1865
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
The question is, if it would expand so quickly,

1866
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
if it would have such adoption,

1867
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
if it would have so many users,

1868
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
if it would have so many people.

1869
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
We didn't know it was unsecure.

1870
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Everything was built on trust,

1871
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
emails, sometimes you sent emails,

1872
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
you went to another SMPD,

1873
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
then you sent it there, then there.

1874
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
If we go back to the beginning,

1875
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
pure enthusiasm and good intentions.

1876
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I would like to ask a question to both senior IT people.

1877
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I recently saw on Twitter

1878
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
of a very senior IT person,

1879
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and it's a beautiful screenshot

1880
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
of a disk manager for a ride,

1881
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and everything is fucking red.

1882
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
You can see from the color that it's a shitshow.

1883
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It says there that two thirds of the disks

1884
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
went to shit.

1885
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's a shitshow.

1886
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Be moral.

1887
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Do you want me to be moral?

1888
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
OK.

1889
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Many of our colleagues probably

1890
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
said what you just said,

1891
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
and I agree, it's great.

1892
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
But let me try to solve this real case.

1893
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
How to communicate this

1894
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
with your stakeholders and organizations?

1895
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That something is serious,

1896
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and we already know that

1897
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
neither time nor money, la la la.

1898
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
What is the value in such cases?

1899
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Something that should have been

1900
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
resolved a long time ago,

1901
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
something that should have been

1902
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
upgraded a long time ago,

1903
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
something that we will understand

1904
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
100% that is very difficult.

1905
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
How to communicate with stakeholders?

1906
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
How to solve these problems?

1907
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Because I know that our audience

1908
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
has this experience.

1909
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
This is a very interesting story.

1910
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
We have a security team.

1911
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
We have a couple of projects

1912
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
that we want to start as a security team.

1913
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We want to start with some

1914
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
client-side ideas,

1915
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
to some firewalls,

1916
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
or some big firewalls

1917
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
that you have in front of endpoints

1918
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
and similar areas.

1919
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
As I said, the number of projects

1920
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
that I could name within security

1921
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
was so large,

1922
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
that in a way,

1923
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
those stakeholders who gave

1924
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
as if they understood it,

1925
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
gave it as a gift,

1926
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
but then what is needed?

1927
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
We need to buy this,

1928
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
we need to replace this,

1929
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
we need to solve this,

1930
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
but we don't listen to it,

1931
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
we don't find the money.

1932
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
We have a strategy,

1933
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
a strategy that was so...

1934
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
At some point, it seemed to me,

1935
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
OK, let's not drag everything together.

1936
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
We have packed everything

1937
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
into this ransomware readiness.

1938
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Because we are trying

1939
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

1940
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
So that we can do some web application security,

1941
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
we can do some pentests.

1942
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Here, our audience will not be

1943
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
But that's why we put it all under the roof,

1944
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
so that the decision-makers understand

1945
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
how this kind of attack happens.

1946
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
That all the computers are simply hacked.

1947
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
You have the whole company,

1948
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
you can't take any action.

1949
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
You come to the front page of the newspaper,

1950
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
to 24 hours,

1951
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
to the big media,

1952
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
you are the main story.

1953
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And that's how the hacking begins.

1954
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Who will be those who will stand in front of the camera

1955
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
and say, we didn't count on that,

1956
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
we weren't prepared,

1957
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
we didn't even have a backup.

1958
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
In a way, we chose such a strategy,

1959
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
because it will be one way for these people

1960
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
to understand the scale,

1961
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
who will come to an incident.

1962
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
There are different incidents,

1963
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
different types of incidents that can happen to you.

1964
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Let's say, some leakages,

1965
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
some data,

1966
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
so that no one can access your systems,

1967
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
and possibly the data of your users,

1968
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
and so on.

1969
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
That was such a task,

1970
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
that we started to move things in the same direction,

1971
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
and we also succeeded on the board,

1972
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
to get enough listening,

1973
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
enough resources.

1974
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Let's say that things were still moving slowly,

1975
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
but people on the other side

1976
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
have actively understood the distraction,

1977
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
which a security incident

1978
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
can cause for itself.

1979
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And how?

1980
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I had an example,

1981
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
which was more related to the organization,

1982
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
and the complexity of the organization,

1983
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and the late responses.

1984
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It came to the point that,

1985
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I mean, it's not a bad or a terrible thing,

1986
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
but we lost one day of work,

1987
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
which is bad in every way,

1988
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
and we lost a lot of time,

1989
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
which is bad in every way.

1990
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It's not a bad thing,

1991
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
but it was a lesson for me,

1992
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
that I have to be more organized,

1993
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and when something is really critical,

1994
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I have to work harder,

1995
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
even if it's not for me in the final phase,

1996
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
because I was blacklisted,

1997
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I was fired twice,

1998
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
and the third time,

1999
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
it was for a bigger company,

2000
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
and it was for a girl,

2001
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
who was already out,

2002
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
and she was out for three months,

2003
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
so the waiter came,

2004
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
and she was about to overheat,

2005
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
so they put a fan in front of her,

2006
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
to cool her down,

2007
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
and after that,

2008
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
it was still poorly documented,

2009
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and poorly connected,

2010
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
so from that UPS,

2011
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
it was connected to another UPS.

2012
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
And on the day of the power outage,

2013
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
it was Thursday,

2014
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
no, it was Friday,

2015
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
it was late afternoon,

2016
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
and they called me,

2017
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
that everything is quiet,

2018
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
and I said, are you sure?

2019
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I was sick,

2020
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
and I had a low fever,

2021
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and I wasn't sick,

2022
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
because I had a fever of 40,

2023
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and I saw it twice.

2024
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
So I thought,

2025
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
why aren't you more serious?

2026
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Because it just went by,

2027
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and it was for me,

2028
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
and for them as well,

2029
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
because we could only go back

2030
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
to the situation on Thursday night,

2031
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
because the storage didn't survive,

2032
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
everything was corrupted,

2033
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and so I realized,

2034
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
that it's more critical,

2035
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and I'm much more vocal about it now,

2036
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I'm much more explicit when I write an email,

2037
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I say, look, from this moment on,

2038
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I don't have to take any responsibility,

2039
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
because it's such a critical element,

2040
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
that it's really a problem,

2041
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
if it's not in the system,

2042
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
as an operator.

2043
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
There were some drills,

2044
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
that worked out,

2045
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
because in Slovenia,

2046
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I successfully wrote the documents,

2047
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
and when the management said,

2048
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
when are we going to do that drill,

2049
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
that I'm going to turn off the UPS,

2050
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
well, no.

2051
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
That's why I have a company,

2052
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
that needs to be repaired once a year,

2053
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and that's on Saturday,

2054
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and we're really going through that,

2055
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
because there's no other way.

2056
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And until we had the aggregators,

2057
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
we were still aware,

2058
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
that the scripts for shutdown,

2059
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
work as they should,

2060
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
when you have complex systems,

2061
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
but there has to be a successor,

2062
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
if you want things to be healthy,

2063
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
and not to rebuild 100 years later.

2064
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And in the meantime,

2065
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
we did a successful shutdown,

2066
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
and then we added some good chevapchiches,

2067
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and when the repairs were done,

2068
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
we burned them,

2069
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
and lived happily ever after.

2070
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
The agreement is,

2071
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
that we test it during production time,

2072
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
so that when we do it on the 9th of the morning,

2073
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
the aggregator starts,

2074
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
and we monitor what's going on,

2075
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
because we said,

2076
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
this is a real scenario,

2077
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
and none of the other scenarios are real,

2078
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and we have to try.

2079
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Everything is in the cloud,

2080
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
if you have a datacenter,

2081
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
everything is virtualized,

2082
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
we're still talking about some spinning parts,

2083
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
and sometimes the problem is,

2084
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
that when the shutdown happens,

2085
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
things don't spin anymore,

2086
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
an update happens,

2087
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
things don't get lost,

2088
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
and the virtualized datacenter

2089
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
doesn't come back.

2090
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That's why,

2091
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
in this environment,

2092
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I see that the drills,

2093
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
are the real scenarios,

2094
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
that happened to us,

2095
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and now we solve them,

2096
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
because we know how to solve them.

2097
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Does your company have some labs,

2098
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
or some capacity,

2099
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
so that their employees can learn,

2100
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
run, test,

2101
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I know that a lot of our listeners have home labs,

2102
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I've seen beautiful pictures,

2103
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
they have everything at home,

2104
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
but how big is your company?

2105
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I'm interested in that.

2106
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I work with people who are crazy,

2107
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
who are huge enthusiasts,

2108
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
passionate about their work,

2109
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
and think proactively,

2110
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
and you want to create an environment

2111
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
where you can play and test.

2112
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I don't know how to imagine,

2113
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
that you're dealing with

2114
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
an architecture of systems,

2115
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
and you don't have a lab,

2116
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
or an environment where you can test,

2117
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
look, and so on.

2118
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
When I was preparing for this project,

2119
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
and I was working in our datacenter,

2120
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
in the laboratory environment,

2121
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I saw a lot of gratitude from people,

2122
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
who said, after the lecture,

2123
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
that they can connect with the company,

2124
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
that they don't want to test in real life.

2125
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Try it here, do it there,

2126
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
and you'll see how things will react.

2127
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I always tell them,

2128
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
if anyone wants to test anything,

2129
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
send me an email,

2130
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm always ready to help.

2131
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
This is another question,

2132
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I know it's a bit bigger,

2133
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
but I love Wi-Fi,

2134
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and I think you're the same,

2135
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
and a very specific Wi-Fi,

2136
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
not the home Wi-Fi,

2137
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
where you set a point,

2138
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
and you both decided at some point,

2139
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
that you, as a student,

2140
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
you both decided at some point,

2141
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
that you'll set up city-wide wireless access,

2142
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
can you both tell me a bit more,

2143
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
why did you want to set up your wireless,

2144
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
what did you learn from it,

2145
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
because it seems to me,

2146
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I don't know if it works today,

2147
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
maybe it will fix it,

2148
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I don't know if it was a new technology,

2149
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
but why did you give the city Wi-Fi?

2150
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I was impressed,

2151
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
when I was in Nizozemsk,

2152
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I saw these squatters,

2153
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
who squat some old houses,

2154
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
and usually this house

2155
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
without water, electricity,

2156
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
and somehow internet,

2157
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and that's how these people

2158
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
solve this problem,

2159
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and they connect some aggregates,

2160
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
or they connect some electricity,

2161
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
and that's where they get the internet.

2162
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
And this sharing,

2163
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
where you don't just switch

2164
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
to a neighbor's access point,

2165
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
and the internet starts there,

2166
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
but these communities,

2167
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
which exist in the city,

2168
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I found it very interesting,

2169
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
because it was used

2170
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
on a very simple device,

2171
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
but not here,

2172
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
there was a Linksy 54GL.

2173
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Was it used for domestic use?

2174
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
It was used for shopping.

2175
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
There were a lot of these routers in Linksy,

2176
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
you could flash them,

2177
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and there was a bunch of

2178
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Linkstate routing protocols,

2179
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
which enabled you to create

2180
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
some kind of mesh,

2181
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
which connected to each other,

2182
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
and there was a pretty large

2183
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
routing table,

2184
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
so that you could access

2185
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
the other end of the city

2186
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And you created the mesh

2187
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
only with the domestic routers?

2188
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yes, of course,

2189
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
you could modify the antenna,

2190
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
so that it had a better range,

2191
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
there was also a DIY scene,

2192
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
where you could learn

2193
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
how to make antennas,

2194
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and a little bit of radio engineering.

2195
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It was a pretty simple approach,

2196
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
how to make a signal

2197
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
connected to one end

2198
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
of the city to the other,

2199
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and that was it.

2200
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Let's go to the revolution,

2201
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
let's share the internet

2202
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
to someone on the other end of the city.

2203
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Is that how it works now?

2204
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I had a great project,

2205
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
which I started in Ljubljana,

2206
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
and I got a lot of enthusiasts,

2207
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
who climbed on the roofs

2208
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
and installed it,

2209
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
but the times were different,

2210
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
so you have to understand

2211
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
that there was no LTE,

2212
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
so that you could go

2213
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
to a broadband internet.

2214
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
There were some first optics,

2215
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
where people had a broadband internet,

2216
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
but...

2217
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
But where did the traffic go?

2218
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
You had the opportunity

2219
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
to have the internet,

2220
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
you installed a router

2221
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
next to the access points,

2222
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
and you shared your internet,

2223
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
but no one had access to the internet.

2224
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Today, it is very unimaginable,

2225
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
we still need this kind of wireless,

2226
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
because when you take your phone out,

2227
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
everyone gives you some data transfer

2228
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
with enough capacity

2229
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
that you don't need it anymore.

2230
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I imagine that in some rural areas,

2231
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
where you have more experience,

2232
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
people still drink water.

2233
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
You know what,

2234
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I heard about their project

2235
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
in Ljubljana and Slovenia,

2236
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
and I probably heard something

2237
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
about CyberPIP.

2238
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
We started in the same way,

2239
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
NWRT 54G was at the club of students,

2240
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
and we had a multimedia center there,

2241
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
students had a bar,

2242
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
we gave them a bar,

2243
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and then we started to share it.

2244
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
It was a bit different than in Ljubljana,

2245
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
we didn't hack Linux,

2246
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
but we connected those points

2247
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
to the existing access points.

2248
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
The point was connected to a central point

2249
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
on the Internet,

2250
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
and we were afraid that if someone

2251
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
would do something stupid in a bar,

2252
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
like a deliberate activity,

2253
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
the owner of the bar would be in trouble,

2254
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and the point would be in the trash.

2255
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
That's why we decided

2256
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
to go through a central point

2257
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
where we will connect,

2258
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
ULAN Novogorica celebrates its 20th anniversary this year,

2259
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
and there are 500 points,

2260
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
500 routers, which is a lot.

2261
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I learned a lot from that.

2262
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
About 17,000 devices are connected per day,

2263
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
not on purpose, of course,

2264
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
but it's still an impressive number.

2265
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And about 100-150 megabits,

2266
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
we vary it by a second,

2267
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
if you are at the central point.

2268
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
When we had the Technical Culture Day,

2269
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
some students came,

2270
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
and we were talking about local Wi-Fi,

2271
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
and I didn't care who was using it.

2272
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
It was a great experience for me,

2273
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I'm 20 years old,

2274
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
and I don't think anyone can take it away from me.

2275
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But I learned a lot.

2276
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
If you don't have an operator,

2277
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
you don't have it.

2278
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
But you already have some kind of operator status?

2279
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
No, no, no.

2280
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
That should be regulated at some point.

2281
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
The truth is,

2282
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
nobody cares about it,

2283
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
or nobody cares about it as much as you do.

2284
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
It would be nice if young people would take it away,

2285
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
and young people would say,

2286
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
yes, we use it all.

2287
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I was worried that packages would be overpriced,

2288
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
that it would be obsolete,

2289
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
but it's not like that.

2290
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Those students told me,

2291
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
yes, I only have 2 GB,

2292
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
and I'm on Wi-Fi all the time.

2293
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And I believe that a segment of the population

2294
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
doesn't care about the price of those packages.

2295
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Especially in vulnerable groups,

2296
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
like the elderly and young people.

2297
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
In short, using it is great,

2298
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
so it makes me happy.

2299
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
And the fact that they don't pay anything,

2300
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
is it purely open?

2301
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
No, it's purely open.

2302
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
In 2012-2013, we had a captive portal,

2303
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
which was a greeting at the beginning.

2304
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
You were greeted at the New York airport,

2305
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
but then you moved on.

2306
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
But when people started using messenger platforms,

2307
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I decided to remove it.

2308
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
People are connected now,

2309
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
but they didn't click on the I agree button,

2310
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and the messenger is stuck there.

2311
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
For some time, I tried to whitelist it,

2312
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
but it was difficult with the technologies available in 2013.

2313
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Maybe today, with a next-generation firewall,

2314
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
it would work,

2315
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
but I have to make sure that it doesn't eat up

2316
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
my life plan.

2317
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Wait, you're saying you have 500 devices?

2318
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
You know what they used to tell me?

2319
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Our access point,

2320
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
we have 2 access points,

2321
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
and one day, a girl came up to me and said,

2322
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
you know what, you give everyone the Internet,

2323
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
but you don't give us Wi-Fi at home.

2324
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It's not OK.

2325
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I have an access point on both sides,

2326
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
facing the public,

2327
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
because I think it's cool

2328
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
to protect the spirit of some community.

2329
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
People either can't access it,

2330
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
or they're stuck on it.

2331
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Do you flash those devices?

2332
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yes.

2333
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Do you have a group that helps you?

2334
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Once, I was on a...

2335
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
What's it called?

2336
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Sinok.

2337
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Yes, Sinok.

2338
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I said, I'm the only one talking.

2339
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
At the beginning,

2340
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
we were a big student club.

2341
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Together, we worked on the computer,

2342
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
but in the end, I was left alone with it.

2343
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Give us more about those devices.

2344
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Is it a low-end router?

2345
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Do you give it to someone at home,

2346
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
and then you connect it to an antenna?

2347
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
It's very different.

2348
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
which had Wi-Fi in them, most of the points were like that.

2349
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And I took it to the bar and said,

2350
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
look, you just flip it over, they'll give you a steering wheel here,

2351
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
we'll spread it, I don't know.

2352
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
In the meantime, I asked them how wide they were,

2353
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
and they said, I don't know, 20 megas,

2354
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
and I said, okay, we'll turn 10 megas QoS up,

2355
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
and people will have 10 megas to surf.

2356
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
And so the points grew over time,

2357
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
all those routers came together,

2358
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
then it went bankrupt, I don't know,

2359
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
some bar closed,

2360
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
they took it all out,

2361
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
they changed it, and they threw it in the trash,

2362
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
they don't know why.

2363
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Those MikroTiks were a bit worse at the time,

2364
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
they looked like some kind of fire-fighting system.

2365
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But anyway,

2366
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
there are about 500 left,

2367
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
which are still being made.

2368
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Those MikroTiks,

2369
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
then later I started adding

2370
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
some second-hand CISCO access points

2371
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
to that router, so I had better radio.

2372
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Because MikroTik is a cool routing device,

2373
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
WPN and all that stuff, QoS, no problem,

2374
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
but it's a bit shabby on the radio part,

2375
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
especially the older ones.

2376
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
And then I started buying

2377
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
those second-hand CISCOs,

2378
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
which are much better than that,

2379
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
and I started adding them from the side,

2380
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and that's how it is,

2381
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
then I really did it.

2382
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So technically,

2383
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
you mean,

2384
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
it's some kind of WPN,

2385
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
you use WPN,

2386
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
and what kind of type?

2387
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
All sorts,

2388
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
just to turn it inside out.

2389
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
So, you support everything.

2390
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Yes, I mean,

2391
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
we have a point on the local offer

2392
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
of KT Novogorica,

2393
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
which I also participate in,

2394
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
and we are ready to

2395
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
add that business-wide.

2396
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And this router

2397
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
will receive that WPN from all sides,

2398
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
and then

2399
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
the market will be honest.

2400
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I don't know why,

2401
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
but it sounds like a bad idea.

2402
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I mean, at that time,

2403
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
people were

2404
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
buying everything,

2405
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
drugs, whatever.

2406
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
We had an episode

2407
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
where someone set up a tour

2408
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
because he wanted to share

2409
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
his internet,

2410
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
and he had a hard time with that,

2411
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
because of his IP.

2412
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Absolutely.

2413
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
There are definitely

2414
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
vegans out there,

2415
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
and there are a lot of

2416
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
vegans in the lobby,

2417
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
but we can't sell

2418
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
drugs or mercury

2419
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
because of that.

2420
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I mean, I count on people's kindness,

2421
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
and if something happens...

2422
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
You don't record

2423
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
any incidents that would...

2424
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
In those 20 years,

2425
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
maybe it was twice,

2426
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
but it still turned out

2427
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
to be more...

2428
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Spamming.

2429
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
There was a forum,

2430
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
and someone was arrested,

2431
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
and then there were some protests.

2432
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
In short, there are more things like that.

2433
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I agree,

2434
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
this is becoming more

2435
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
vegan than ever,

2436
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
and the question is

2437
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
if this will continue

2438
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
in the future.

2439
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Even if there won't be

2440
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
any episode,

2441
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
it's been a long time.

2442
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
20 years is still

2443
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
not a long time.

2444
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You can cut it off now,

2445
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
and no one will notice.

2446
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Did people thank you back then?

2447
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Did people know that this was happening to you?

2448
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Those who knew,

2449
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I assume they were grateful.

2450
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
The guys who

2451
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
recently did that,

2452
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
they were like, really?

2453
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
You know what?

2454
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Times have changed.

2455
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Today, you can't tell someone

2456
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
what kind of person they are.

2457
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
What is he doing?

2458
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Why is he doing this?

2459
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
It's very unusual in today's world.

2460
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But you know what?

2461
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
There is a chance that

2462
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
this will be normal one day,

2463
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
and we won't have to ask.

2464
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
You probably also

2465
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
learned a lot,

2466
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
that this was

2467
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
a playground

2468
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
where you learned a lot.

2469
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I assume you also

2470
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
automated a lot of things.

2471
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
You were able to quickly

2472
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
see what works and what doesn't.

2473
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Absolutely.

2474
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
That's another point.

2475
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
If you work

2476
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
in a certain environment,

2477
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
you return something to it.

2478
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I think that's better for everything.

2479
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yes.

2480
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
That's also

2481
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
one of the things

2482
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
that Otto added

2483
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
to this podcast.

2484
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
We are here because we have

2485
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
enough time in this industry

2486
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
to return something.

2487
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I think it's impossible

2488
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
to approach people

2489
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
who are very experienced.

2490
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Our goal is

2491
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
to try to be a fence

2492
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
through which we can

2493
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
transfer knowledge to the next generation.

2494
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Maybe we will record it

2495
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
so that it will survive for a long time

2496
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
and people will be able to see it.

2497
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
If they are

2498
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
senior people,

2499
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
it's clear to them.

2500
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
It's a no-brainer.

2501
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
They want to understand

2502
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
why they need a platform

2503
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
to be able to transfer it.

2504
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I think I could

2505
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
summarize our episode

2506
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
to the end.

2507
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I also had a question about

2508
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
why Loki had such a huge antenna.

2509
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I don't know what he gave it to me,

2510
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
but he had an antenna under his nose.

2511
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
When he came inside the office,

2512
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
he saw the same antenna.

2513
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I can't deny that.

2514
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I think it was in the city of Ljubljana.

2515
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I don't know where it was directed.

2516
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
It was an antenna in the city of Ljubljana.

2517
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
There was always a problem

2518
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
when there was a message on Saturday.

2519
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
When the messages were sent,

2520
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
the access point was turned off.

2521
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
It was a problem.

2522
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
It was the best location.

2523
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
You can't go back to the beginning.

2524
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
You can't physically go back

2525
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
to the beginning.

2526
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I would like to sum up

2527
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
the last episode.

2528
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
The last episode.

2529
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I would like to add

2530
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
one more thing.

2531
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
You bring back

2532
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
so many things

2533
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
from the community work.

2534
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I was very impressed

2535
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
when you posted on LinkedIn

2536
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
that you have a workshop

2537
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
for children.

2538
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Where is this passion?

2539
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I would say,

2540
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
OK, I have my own child.

2541
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You want to reach

2542
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
your children in some way.

2543
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
But it works

2544
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
with young people.

2545
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It is a transfer.

2546
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Where is this energy?

2547
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
OK,

2548
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
young people

2549
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
bring back a lot of things.

2550
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
As an example,

2551
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
it is a law for me

2552
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
that we taught them

2553
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
how to drive a 7-seater.

2554
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I would say,

2555
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
we put this in Docker.

2556
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
We are all with a console cable.

2557
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I would say,

2558
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
we are all in a wheelchair.

2559
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
We are all in a wheelchair

2560
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
with a console.

2561
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
These workshops touch the surface

2562
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
of all these things,

2563
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
but we treat them as if they are big.

2564
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
As if they are grown-ups.

2565
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
We work on real equipment.

2566
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
If five engineers

2567
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
will come from this, it will be great.

2568
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I would like them to take this into account

2569
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
from a broad perspective.

2570
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
To know that it is not only art

2571
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
how the Internet comes to their homes.

2572
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
That we went to see the sewage system.

2573
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
That we went to see the data center.

2574
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
That we showed them

2575
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
that it is not like that.

2576
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
That there are some instructions

2577
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
that manage it.

2578
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
If you want,

2579
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
there must be a flow.

2580
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
We brought a server to the data center.

2581
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
We moved some monitoring systems there.

2582
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
They brought a typewriter home.

2583
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Then they engraved their temperatures.

2584
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Then we set up a VoIP center.

2585
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
They brought their phones home.

2586
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
They called each other in the evening.

2587
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
It must exist if you want it to work.

2588
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
They are not masters for Cisco.

2589
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
They are not masters for MicroTik.

2590
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
But they know it.

2591
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
They have seen it.

2592
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
We don't have to erase it.

2593
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
They know where it comes from.

2594
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Hyper-V was so expensive

2595
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
that they don't even watch

2596
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
how they create a virtual machine.

2597
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Now that he knows what virtualization is,

2598
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
he can work on VMware, Proxmox,

2599
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Hyper-V, whatever.

2600
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Now he knows it.

2601
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
He never forgets it.

2602
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
He doesn't erase it.

2603
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
That's great.

2604
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Let's wrap it up.

2605
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Where do you find...

2606
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I have a feeling

2607
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
that those of us

2608
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
who meet today

2609
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
with the young generation

2610
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
entering our industry,

2611
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
they are not interested.

2612
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
They don't know.

2613
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
They would pay a lot.

2614
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
They would be in a director's position.

2615
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
They don't feel

2616
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
that sometimes

2617
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
you have to grind something.

2618
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
You have to do it.

2619
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Do you feel the same?

2620
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Or is it just

2621
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
a burning desire

2622
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
for young people

2623
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
to be more interested

2624
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
in these things?

2625
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Two things.

2626
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
First, the older ones,

2627
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
when they see that I publish it,

2628
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
they get to know me,

2629
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
they know that I work with enthusiasm.

2630
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
They are like,

2631
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
where have you been?

2632
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I will show you something.

2633
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I use them,

2634
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
today they are more instant.

2635
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
They want it all instant.

2636
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That's why I designed

2637
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
the program From Zero to Hero.

2638
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
They come in,

2639
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
they don't know anything about Cisco.

2640
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
They click in the console

2641
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
and see what we have changed.

2642
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
They are excited about the success.

2643
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
We try to make

2644
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
all these things

2645
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
so that they are modular

2646
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
and that they go from zero to hero.

2647
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
When he is awarded

2648
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
that he succeeded,

2649
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
it motivates him to move forward.

2650
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I will use the same

2651
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
principles they have.

2652
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
If you publish CCCNA all year long,

2653
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
by the end of the year

2654
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
there will be only one position.

2655
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
They will go home and won't come back.

2656
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
If it's logical.

2657
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
You try to make it

2658
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
this way.

2659
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
For example,

2660
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
we will make a hotspot today.

2661
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
What is a hotspot?

2662
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
When you go to Wi-Fi,

2663
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
you open a portal.

2664
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
We have our own point,

2665
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
we go with the phone up,

2666
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
we surf the law.

2667
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Now let's make a hotspot.

2668
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Let's write your name and welcome.

2669
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Then you say,

2670
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I was at home when my friends came.

2671
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
He brings a micro-stick

2672
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
and has a hotspot

2673
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
for his friends.

2674
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Now he learned the hotspot.

2675
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
He knows how it works.

2676
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
What is on the flyer?

2677
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Then his friends

2678
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
mounted a micro-stick

2679
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
and moved the hotspot.

2680
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
If you sing them in this way,

2681
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
they like it.

2682
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
They are motivated

2683
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
and they like it.

2684
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
From somewhere

2685
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
it is a skill

2686
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
how to work

2687
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
in some training.

2688
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
How to

2689
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
pour

2690
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and how to have

2691
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
the engagement.

2692
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Is it a trial and error?

2693
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Yes, absolutely.

2694
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Is it a trap?

2695
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Yes, it is.

2696
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Exactly.

2697
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Two things are changing

2698
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
in the history context.

2699
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
When I was a student,

2700
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
it was a different audience.

2701
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Today,

2702
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
children are different people.

2703
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
But you can always

2704
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
motivate them.

2705
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Someone has been coming to us for 5 years

2706
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and I told him,

2707
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
you are a mentor,

2708
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I have nothing to teach you.

2709
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
You can start doing real things,

2710
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
but you will be a mentor.

2711
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
You will start teaching

2712
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
and you will come to us

2713
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
and go further.

2714
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I am not interested

2715
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
in doing this until the end of my life.

2716
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I am interested in

2717
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
mentoring people and

2718
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
start cycling further.

2719
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Start with new technologies,

2720
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
new things, programming.

2721
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
We broke it on modules this year.

2722
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
We have different modules, different areas.

2723
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
It is great.

2724
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I don't have anything to add.

2725
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I just want you to save energy

2726
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
and the spark you definitely have.

2727
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
On behalf of the community,

2728
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
thank you for your efforts.

2729
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Thank you too.

2730
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
It is a great honor for me

2731
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
to be your guest in Grodno.

2732
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I respect you and you do a great job.

2733
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Thank you very much.

2734
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
At this point,

2735
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
thank you, Luka,

2736
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
for your time

2737
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
and for hosting us here.

2738
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Thank you very much.

2739
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I think

2740
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
you are giving a lot.

2741
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
A lot.

2742
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
With a spark.

2743
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I have a feeling

2744
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
that people in this industry,

2745
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
in our industry,

2746
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
are lacking in their own way.

2747
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
There is a lot of cynicism,

2748
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
negativity,

2749
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
something is not allowed.

2750
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
When we first met,

2751
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I thought

2752
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
you are really

2753
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
doing a great job.

2754
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Thank you.

2755
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000

Thank you for being with us.

2759
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
See you next time.

2760
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Maybe next year.

2761
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Yes, next year.

2762
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I could sell something.

2763
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Both of them.

2764
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Thank you.

2765
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
You

2766
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
You

2767
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
You
