1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What do you think about 9mm in your home country?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here it is, we're here. What did you ask him, if he has a 9mm at home or what?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Where are you now, in Texas or what?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've been in Texas for three and a half years.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Austin, but Austin is completely...

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Austin is completely different from Texas.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Austin is in Texas.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It is in Texas, but Austin is...

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's the main city in Texas.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's completely European, isn't it?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a liberal oasis in the middle of the real America.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But are they all armed or just those who protect the country?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Most of them are, you just don't know.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Can you carry a hidden weapon?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can carry it, but only if you need a license.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Otherwise, no.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Otherwise, you have it at home.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, okay.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Greetings to all our listeners.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Today, AndraÅ¾ and I invited a special guest to the episode of Grodno.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In Slovenia, we call him Mike, but here they call him Miha,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because people know him better.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He's more unique.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He's more unique.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, Mike is known in Slovenia for his passionate love for Ruby.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And I'm afraid that today you will also speak Ruby,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
like the language of the future.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I wanted to introduce him to our audience,

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
to tell them about your journey from Slovenia to Tuin,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
where you've been for 15 years now.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
To tell us that it's a place for good engineering,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and how engineers can succeed in this world.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
To share your story with us.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's the idea of today's conversation.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Did I forget something?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I wanted to say that today we're not sitting in the office,

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
like we usually do in Grodno.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, we can say that.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Today, in our traditional office,

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
where we usually don't have so much heat,

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we looked for a studio,

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and Kaldi hosted us today,

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and we're now in front of them.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, thank you, Kaldi.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
First of all, Miha and I were in elementary school,

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
so I've been preparing for a while.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Miha is a server engineer,

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and Miha is an orc,

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
because Miha started working with a website,

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
when we didn't know what a website was.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So, first of all, can you tell us

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
how Miha started playing with PHP and web servers?

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Before PHP, there was HTML, CSS,

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and before all that, Visual Basic.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know exactly what kind of order, but yes.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That was when I was in elementary school.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I always had a computer with me,

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
because my dad used a computer,

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and I was at home with a computer.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I used to play some games,

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
but I never really got into them,

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and I also liked to create things.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And yes, I really liked the front page,

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
if I remember correctly,

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
because the front page was from Microsoft.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And it was like, what you see is what you get,

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
because there was a word for HTML 9.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And that's where I started playing.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I was the first one to register,

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I already had some MihaRebenik.com,

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and I have a really bad memory for a long time,

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
but I remember that Revija Pil,

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
which was in Slovenia, had some...

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That still exists.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That Pil still exists.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But at that time it had, I don't know what,

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
some kind of a trend, a split page,

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know, I don't know.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know, I don't know.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In general, I didn't register,

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and I didn't win anything, but...

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's how I started playing with PHP,

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
because HTML was so static,

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and I was looking at those URLs,

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and they had some questions in them,

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and something could change,

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and I didn't know what was going on.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And so I discovered PHP,

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and it was great.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Watch out, you'll jump over the fence,

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and you'll get eaten.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes, yes.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes, PHP was great.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was the ultimate hacker tool.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You just typed something,

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
it was like HTML,

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
it's called full...

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
forgiving, right?

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can...

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you can forget something,

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and someone else did everything.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So to start with, yes,

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it was great.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
At what point did you realize

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
that it's a medium,

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that it's a tool

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
with which you can communicate with the world?

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think that's really important,

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that underlying message,

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and how it helped you in your projects.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't know.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I mean,

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't know if I was actually studying

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
like that at the time,

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
now that I look back,

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but I can say that I discovered,

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
yes, once I created my own

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MikesRDG site,

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
which was like a local Facebook

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
for my group,

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
in a broader sense.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know,

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
there were albums,

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and some stories,

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and pictures,

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and yes,

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
at the time,

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I realized,

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ah,

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
there's something here,

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that's really cool.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You had a bit of influence

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
from that,

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you know,

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
like a geek,

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you all...

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And that with Velenja.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's...

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's...

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's the voice

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
we don't have to hide.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let me just say,

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
maybe in this chapter,

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
in my...

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now you have Stack Overflow,

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
now you have GPTA,

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and all those videos,

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and the whole building process,

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and all the crazy stuff.

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How did you learn

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to compile your Apache,

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
your PHP,

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
your Linux kernel?

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I told you,

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have a bad memory.

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, but...

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's different,

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
how do you perceive,

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know,

165
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
maybe that

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
learning process,

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
how did you get

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to some knowledge,

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
for example,

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
what does it look like today?

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, yes, yes.

172
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I mean,

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
at one point,

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I was reading a book,

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Unix Bible.

176
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes.

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I mean,

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
sometimes things

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
just develop a bit slower,

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and you can read books.

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So that was...

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Otherwise,

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think the biggest thing

184
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
was just cleaning up,

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
experimenting.

186
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I mean,

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
that Unix Bible,

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
for example,

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
gave you enough knowledge

190
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
to be able to do,

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know,

192
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
man,

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and then you changed

194
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the domain or whatever,

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and...

196
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think that

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it's like some...

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
like a...

200
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
like a finder or something,

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
where I had

202
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
endless time,

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and...

204
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know,

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I was reading,

206
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
typing,

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
formatting on the computer

208
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
every few days,

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and so on.

210
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And do you think

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that maybe,

212
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
like,

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
if you compare

214
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
those times,

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that now there's

216
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
so much technology,

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
that it's really hard

218
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to be up to date,

219
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or are you so

220
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
involved in some,

221
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know,

222
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
let's say,

223
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
from a project,

224
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
a family,

225
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
to...

226
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
to a regular job,

227
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that you don't find

228
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
that...

229
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes,

230
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I mean,

231
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
at the moment,

232
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
it's really my insight,

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
probably when you're older,

234
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
when you have

235
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
some other obligations.

236
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But,

237
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
in a different way,

238
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
it's easier

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to fake it

240
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
till you make it

241
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in the network,

242
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
right?

243
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because,

244
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
because stack overflow

245
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is great,

246
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but, for example,

247
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
now those GPTs

248
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
are stack overflow

249
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
on steroids,

250
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
right?

251
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Because,

252
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
in fact,

253
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
not only does it try

254
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to find the right answer for you,

255
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but it also customizes it

256
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
exactly for you

257
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
so,

258
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
if you try to

259
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
set something up

260
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
quickly,

261
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
it's much,

262
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
much easier now,

263
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
right?

264
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well,

265
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
but I'm looking

266
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
through this prism

267
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that,

268
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
because you went

269
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
in that direction,

270
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
right?

271
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In fact,

272
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
those foundations

273
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
for you

274
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
are probably

275
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
much better set

276
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
than,

277
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't know,

278
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
someone who

279
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
wants to come

280
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
quickly,

281
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
right?

282
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And all this,

283
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think,

284
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I've noticed

285
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that I won't

286
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
be able to

287
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
do that,

288
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
right?

289
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Because people

290
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
come from fax

291
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and they know

292
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
some things

293
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
much better

294
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
than I do,

295
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
maybe,

296
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know,

297
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
some very specific

298
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
algorithms or

299
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
something like that,

300
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but they've never

301
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
set up a DNS

302
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
server,

303
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
right?

304
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Or something like

305
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that,

306
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and they also

307
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
know the theory,

308
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but it's not

309
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the same as

310
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you said,

311
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
right?

312
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If I played,

313
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it was fun

314
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to have my

315
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
friends there,

316
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and you get to know

317
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
them so deeply,

318
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you never forget

319
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
them and,

320
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
yeah,

321
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
they're really

322
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in their foundations.

323
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So,

324
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that self-taught

325
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
aspect,

326
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I think,

327
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
all universities

328
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
are probably

329
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
great,

330
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I didn't finish

331
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the computer

332
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
studies at

333
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the university,

334
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
so...

335
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Because you

336
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
got into work

337
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
too quickly

338
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and stuff like that?

339
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah,

340
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
yeah,

341
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
yeah,

342
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
too much,

343
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I mean,

344
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I think that's

345
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the thing

346
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that made me

347
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
happy.

348
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can't

349
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
explain

350
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
why,

351
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
why not.

352
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean,

353
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
my experience

354
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
is that

355
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
no one

356
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
asked me

357
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
about

358
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
any paper,

359
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
you know,

360
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you're...

361
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah,

362
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
not yet.

363
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Maybe

364
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
next year

365
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
when they

366
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
say,

367
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AndraÅ¾,

368
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
where's

369
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
your diploma

370
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
from Unix?

371
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah,

372
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
yeah,

373
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was

374
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
so surprised

375
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
when I saw it,

376
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
even for me

377
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that exclamation

378
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
happens when

379
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you make a connection

380
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
like that.

381
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
A person

382
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
compiled Linux,

383
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
a person

384
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
compiled Apache,

385
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Alok waited

386
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
for hours

387
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to get

388
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
this configuration

389
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
flag and

390
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
then you

391
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
have to

392
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
go back.

393
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But in

394
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
some way

395
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
it just

396
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
seems like

397
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
it's also

398
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
part of

399
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that charm,

400
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that call,

401
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to learn,

402
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to expand,

403
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you know,

404
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you don't

405
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
appreciate it

406
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
if you're

407
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
really just

408
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
on that

409
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
block.

410
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No,

411
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
that story

412
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that,

413
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you know,

414
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I had

415
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
a mechanic

416
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
who went

417
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to fix

418
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
my washing machine

419
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and then

420
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you get

421
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
someone

422
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
so passionate

423
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
when he

424
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
disassembles

425
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
you and

426
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
starts to

427
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
disassemble,

428
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
that's

429
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
such a

430
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
motor that

431
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
it's

432
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
like,

433
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you know,

434
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
it's

435
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
scary,

436
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
like,

437
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
OK,

438
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
let's just

439
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
talk about

440
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the washing machine.

441
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And then

442
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you also

443
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
have people

444
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
who deal

445
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
with oldtimers,

446
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
cars,

447
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you know,

448
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and it's

449
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
pretty much

450
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the same

451
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
with people

452
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
whose

453
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
work

454
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
screws

455
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
from the

456
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
server

457
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
to,

458
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you know,

459
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
a complex

460
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
thing.

461
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And

462
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I think

463
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
that

464
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
when you

465
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
were

466
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
younger,

467
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
you were

468
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
prepared

469
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
to

470
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
forget

471
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the time

472
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and,

473
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you know,

474
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
computers

475
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
are like

476
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that,

477
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
sometimes

478
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you really

479
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
screw

480
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
them up

481
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and

482
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
you dig

483
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
yourself

484
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
out of

485
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the mess

486
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and

487
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
when

488
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you're

489
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
15

490
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
years

491
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
old,

492
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you have

493
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to

494
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
still have

495
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
probably

496
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the

497
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
feeling

498
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that

499
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you're

500
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000

destined

1146
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,119
But still so painful for girls, you should put

1147
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,119
self-hosted

1148
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,119
No

1149
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,119
I mean, Rails was so painful that it was built by Heroku

1150
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,119
but on the other hand

1151
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,119
because it was Heroku, it probably succeeded in a lot of Rails projects

1152
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,119
because it couldn't be otherwise

1153
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:31,119
I think that's how the system grows, with Heroku

1154
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,119
Now I asked Ruby and Rails

1155
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,119
programmers who still

1156
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,119
program in Ruby in Slovenia

1157
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,119
and in Slovenia there is a Ruby Meetup group Slovenia

1158
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,119
rug.cs, on the other hand, is getting even better

1159
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,119
the team with Kristof Ärnjivac was activated again

1160
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,119
Now they gave me a few questions from Ruby

1161
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,119
I can put them here in the corner if you want

1162
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Or with that drop, that organic one.

1163
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,760
I don't know if I want to talk about it now or...

1164
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,960
Those guys are always interested in why they chose Ruby.

1165
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Why did they choose Ruby?

1166
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,080
And all those guys who prepared that question for me,

1167
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,559
knew that Ruby, the author of Ruby Cats,

1168
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:31,559
he said that the mission of Ruby is to create a language that would make programmers happy.

1169
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,560
To make them happy and satisfied.

1170
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,560
And that's some kind of, as you said before, some kind of cultural awareness,

1171
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
or some kind of culture that comes together.

1172
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
And some vibe.

1173
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,560
That's what drives me now, right?

1174
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,560
That you're among happy programmers.

1175
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
A little hippie scene, you hear?

1176
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,560
I'm going to look at the next car when I get home and say,

1177
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,560
hey, let's start a Ruby project.

1178
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,560
But it's not far from the truth.

1179
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,559
I've always enjoyed the fact that only IRB,

1180
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,559
Interactive Ruby, Command Line Interface for Ruby,

1181
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,559
and I don't know, I had some data,

1182
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,559
convert it to CSV, sort it,

1183
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,559
just the syntax, everything that's written.

1184
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,559
And you don't forget it.

1185
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,559
That also tells me that it's really something natural.

1186
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,559
And Rails was a pure extension of that.

1187
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,559
It was exactly built on that happiness.

1188
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,559
People say that everything converges in Python.

1189
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,559
Well, go!

1190
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
It's hard to say, right?

1191
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,559
It's hard to say, right?

1192
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,559
But...

1193
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,559
How do you feel about that?

1194
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,559
Is Ruby still a valid option?

1195
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
Is Rails still a valid option?

1196
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,559
Because if we go back to those projects that you mentioned,

1197
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,559
like Split and Open Source,

1198
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,559
Split was different when Open Source was developed than it is today.

1199
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,559
There was no such thing as a mobile app,

1200
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,559
there was no mobile web development to the extent

1201
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,559
that server-side rendering was...

1202
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,559
You couldn't do anything else, right?

1203
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
You couldn't do anything else, yes.

1204
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
But how do you see that?

1205
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,559
As far as those technologies are concerned,

1206
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:32,559
I try to be very pragmatic and agnostic.

1207
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,559
I think that when people say what's better, what's that,

1208
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,559
it doesn't matter at all.

1209
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,559
If you can find the right solution for your problem,

1210
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
you can use it.

1211
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,559
And sometimes the problem is different at the beginning than later,

1212
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,559
or when the company is bigger and so on.

1213
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,559
And from that, I would say directly that...

1214
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,559
Yes, Ruby and Rails are definitely, for some things,

1215
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,559
probably still the right choice.

1216
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
Maybe later you have to rewrite, but...

1217
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,559
But you can't...

1218
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,559
I think you can't always, at the beginning,

1219
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,559
sometimes not because the investment would be too big

1220
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,559
to choose something else,

1221
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,559
sometimes you don't know,

1222
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,559
or you don't know, or the project will fail.

1223
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,559
Maybe you'll be able to cancel it in half a year

1224
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,559
because you didn't find a partner.

1225
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,559
And you, why would you need a year

1226
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,559
to be fully architectured, with a full language?

1227
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,559
I mean, I don't really understand,

1228
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,559
that Ruby for this...

1229
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,559
Also for this MWP,

1230
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,559
it's good enough,

1231
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,559
it allows you to get to a certain result quickly.

1232
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,559
And then there are the details,

1233
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,559
whether to still run it on Ruby,

1234
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,559
or work on rewriting.

1235
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,559
Yes, I would say that it's an example.

1236
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,559
I think it's probably a very good example,

1237
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,559
precisely because you can prototype quickly,

1238
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,559
you can iterate quickly.

1239
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,559
And that's the most important thing

1240
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,559
when you're doing a business,

1241
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,559
you have to adapt quickly

1242
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,559
and develop things.

1243
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,559
You'll solve the scaling problem

1244
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,559
when it's a scaling problem.

1245
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,559
But do you think that,

1246
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,559
as we said before,

1247
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,559
this well-known video about DHH

1248
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,559
represents Rails?

1249
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
At that time,

1250
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
Rails as a tool

1251
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,559
had certain

1252
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,559
convention, over-configuration,

1253
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,559
certain assumptions,

1254
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,559
certain decisions,

1255
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,559
the market needed such a framework.

1256
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,559
Today, I think,

1257
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,559
it's harder to say

1258
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,559
what the market needs

1259
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,559
for some MWP prototypes.

1260
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,559
Maybe TypeScript

1261
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,559
should be bundled in the framework?

1262
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,559
Or not?

1263
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,559
Are all new projects with TypeScript?

1264
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,559
Probably not.

1265
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,559
Maybe Javascript?

1266
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,559
There are some hard assumptions,

1267
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,559
I don't know,

1268
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,559
for such projects

1269
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,559
which are already

1270
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,559
in the company,

1271
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,559
I don't remember now.

1272
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,559
37signals.

1273
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,559
My question is

1274
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,559
is the toolbox

1275
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,559
or the framework

1276
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,559
today a real checkbox

1277
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,559
for things?

1278
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,559
I don't have an answer,

1279
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,559
so I wonder what you think.

1280
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,559
I won't say I have an exact answer.

1281
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,559
The caveat for the last Rails

1282
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,559
was 4signal, now it's 7signal.

1283
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,559
But I would say

1284
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,559
probably yes.

1285
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,559
Because again,

1286
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,559
I mean,

1287
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,559
even if you make a product

1288
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,559
which can be

1289
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:43,559
real-time and use

1290
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,559
some 3D browser,

1291
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,559
vector apps,

1292
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,559
for example Figma,

1293
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,559
sure, you can't use Rails.

1294
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,559
But for 90%

1295
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,559
of some things, you can still use it.

1296
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,559
Even if you make

1297
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,559
a web app

1298
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,559
which is extremely UI-heavy,

1299
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,559
a daily app,

1300
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,559
Pages, Word,

1301
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,559
whatever, you can't use Rails.

1302
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,559
But for whatever,

1303
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,559
there is a base

1304
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,559
and some information which you will present

1305
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,559
in 100,000 ways,

1306
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,559
you can probably start with Rails.

1307
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,559
How far will you go?

1308
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,559
That's a question.

1309
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,559
Now, the convention over configuration,

1310
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,559
I don't know.

1311
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,559
This philosophy always suited me.

1312
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,559
Because I strived

1313
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,559
that again, 90%

1314
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,559
of products are identical

1315
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,559
and have identical needs.

1316
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,559
D.A. Chech said

1317
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,559
that you are not a snowflake.

1318
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,559
I strive with that.

1319
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,559
Rarely someone is so unique.

1320
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,559
It's true that engineers

1321
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,559
know things, tweak things,

1322
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,559
it's all fully valid.

1323
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,559
But for something

1324
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,559
which was marketed as

1325
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,559
getting things done,

1326
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,559
convention over configuration,

1327
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,559
that's it.

1328
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:05,559
But if you look

1329
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,559
at the jobs

1330
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,559
at the moment,

1331
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,559
to record Rails,

1332
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,559
to look for Rails developers,

1333
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,559
or Ruby developers,

1334
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,559
some new products

1335
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,559
and so on.

1336
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,559
In a way, you see

1337
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,559
that it's a trend

1338
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,559
set by big players

1339
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,559
like JSO,

1340
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,559
Go,

1341
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,559
etc.

1342
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,559
Python.

1343
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,559
Python is

1344
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,559
now this

1345
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,559
numbering

1346
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,559
problem.

1347
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,559
AI and so on.

1348
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,559
It's all

1349
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,559
connected to that.

1350
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,559
When I first looked at Python,

1351
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,559
I chose Python

1352
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,559
instead of Ruby.

1353
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,559
Because

1354
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,559
you can't be similar to anything.

1355
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,559
Python doesn't have Django.

1356
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,559
I was even before that.

1357
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,559
When I started,

1358
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,559
I was even before

1359
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,559
Python.

1360
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,559
Usually, whenever Unix

1361
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,559
was launched, I was almost

1362
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,559
a year old. Python needs

1363
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,559
some time to grow.

1364
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,559
But yeah.

1365
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,559
I think that

1366
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,559
Ruby is still

1367
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,559
in that trend,

1368
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,559
but those

1369
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,559
who know,

1370
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,559
will take Ruby,

1371
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:31,559
and won't rely on some trends.

1372
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,559
We can ask

1373
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,559
a counter question.

1374
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,559
You worked a lot

1375
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,559
with Ruby and Rails.

1376
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,559
Did you have a use case

1377
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,559
when you came to

1378
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,559
another project,

1379
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,559
like C-Sharp

1380
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,559
or Java, and said

1381
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,559
fucking shit, man.

1382
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,559
It was easier with Ruby.

1383
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,559
Yeah.

1384
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,559
I said, fuck, I have to

1385
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,559
go through that door.

1386
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,559
No, no.

1387
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,559
You weren't in that situation?

1388
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,559
No, I wasn't, but I was definitely

1389
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,559
in a situation where

1390
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,559
in my last Ruby project,

1391
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,559
which we can talk about later,

1392
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,559
you definitely

1393
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,559
don't do that in Rails.

1394
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,559
You don't even start that in Rails.

1395
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,559
Yeah.

1396
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,559
That, and type safety.

1397
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,559
I'm a big fan of type safety.

1398
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,559
I think you have

1399
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,559
someone with type script

1400
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,559
or something that C-Sharp

1401
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,559
or something.

1402
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,559
Yeah.

1403
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,559
What you said,

1404
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,559
about the trends,

1405
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,559
yeah, you're right.

1406
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,559
Ruby had a short

1407
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,559
heyday, maybe

1408
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,559
when I went to Silicon Valley,

1409
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,559
it was at the top

1410
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,559
among trendy languages

1411
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,559
and companies were looking for that.

1412
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,559
But trends are trends.

1413
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,559
Just like

1414
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,559
you need a tool for the job.

1415
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,559
You can choose what you need.

1416
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,559
Things have gone forward

1417
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,559
in the React ecosystem and JavaScript.

1418
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,559
I think that

1419
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,559
in general,

1420
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,559
Ruby is fully object-oriented.

1421
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,559
If you write

1422
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,559
functional Ruby,

1423
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,559
people will return your pull requests.

1424
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,559
And the listeners

1425
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,559
among us

1426
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,559
are the listeners who returned

1427
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,559
the pull requests we wrote

1428
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,559
to the functional Ruby.

1429
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,559
I could see it.

1430
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,559
Can you say something about that?

1431
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,559
I think it's a trend

1432
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,559
to have a functional approach,

1433
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,559
a strongly type functional

1434
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,559
language.

1435
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,559
Maybe that's why it got less popular.

1436
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,559
I don't know.

1437
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,559
I don't know.

1438
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,559
But for me,

1439
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,559
maybe because I grew up with it,

1440
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,559
but it was very natural

1441
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,559
to me.

1442
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,559
You can fully apply it

1443
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,559
to a lot of different domains

1444
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,559
and you can model things.

1445
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,559
In the end,

1446
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,559
people

1447
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,559
want to use it.

1448
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,559
No,

1449
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,559
we're too much into it.

1450
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,559
Let's go to the next chapter.

1451
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,559
Today,

1452
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,559
let's talk about YC.

1453
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,559
I will try

1454
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,559
to make an intro.

1455
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,559
When I was preparing

1456
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,559
for this episode,

1457
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,559
I went to the RTV Slovenia archive

1458
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,559
to see

1459
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,559
your story with YCM.

1460
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,559
Your story with YCM.

1461
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,559
It says that

1462
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,559
YC is the most elite

1463
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,559
and respected incubator

1464
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,559
in the world,

1465
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,559
in San Francisco.

1466
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,559
Paul Graham has been leading it

1467
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:43,559
for a hundred years.

1468
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,559
It's an incubator from which

1469
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,559
Dropbox,

1470
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,559
Airbnb, Coinbase,

1471
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,559
Reddit,

1472
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,559
and probably

1473
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,559
for some time

1474
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,559
a lot of tech companies

1475
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,559
from all over the world

1476
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,559
that are billion-dollar companies

1477
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,559
have been in there.

1478
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,559
Together with Robert Farazino,

1479
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,559
Rock GregoriÄ,

1480
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,559
Rock Rulc,

1481
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,559
I probably forgot someone,

1482
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,559
in 2011,

1483
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:19,559
2012,

1484
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,559
you applied

1485
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,559
to your company

1486
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,559
at YC and you were accepted

1487
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,559
as the first Slovenian team.

1488
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,559
I think that after that

1489
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,559
two or three Slovenian teams

1490
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,559
were accepted, but you were

1491
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,559
the first Slovenian team.

1492
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,559
Oral is the only one.

1493
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,559
And you came there.

1494
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,559
Now,

1495
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,559
according to some statistics,

1496
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,559
I would like to illustrate

1497
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,559
what this event means.

1498
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,559
Some 10,000 companies

1499
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,559
apply twice a year,

1500
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,559
and in the summer they accept

1501
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,559
1.5 to 3%

1502
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,559
depending on what comes in

1503
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,559
from all over the world.

1504
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,559
And yes, you were accepted.

1505
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,559
Now,

1506
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,559
on RTVE,

1507
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,559
when people ask

1508
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,559
what do you suggest

1509
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,559
people to watch,

1510
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,559
it's a full achievement.

1511
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,559
Because of that,

1512
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,559
I think you got a lot of opportunities

1513
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,559
and that's why you should watch it.

1514
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,559
Now, I'm curious,

1515
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,559
what happened in 2011?

1516
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,559
What did you do

1517
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:29,559
with the team

1518
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,559
to come here today

1519
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,559
and tell us what happened?

1520
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,559
I think we should go back to 2010.

1521
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,559
After those

1522
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,559
opening hours,

1523
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,559
I got to know...

1524
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,559
Those opening hours were interesting.

1525
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,559
The Slovenian ecosystem

1526
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,559
helped in one way or another.

1527
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,559
For example, I met Roka GregoriÄ

1528
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,559
and Robert Farazin there.

1529
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,559
Both of you helped

1530
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,559
with some things.

1531
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,559
Once, when we were

1532
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,559
heading home

1533
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,559
from a meeting

1534
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,559
where we work,

1535
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,559
I went with Robert

1536
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,559
back to Maribor

1537
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,559
and they said they were starting a project

1538
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:11,559
and they needed a web guy.

1539
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,559
They had everything covered,

1540
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,559
but they didn't have a web guy.

1541
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,559
So, I went to check it out.

1542
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,559
At the time, they had a whole office.

1543
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,559
I went to check it out

1544
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,559
and they were cool.

1545
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,559
I didn't care

1546
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:29,559
what they wanted to do.

1547
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,559
That was

1548
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,559
my topic

1549
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,559
because at the end of the day,

1550
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,559
it's not that important.

1551
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,559
It's more important

1552
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:41,559
who is there

1553
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,559
and give them some energy.

1554
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:45,559
What did we do?

1555
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,559
At the beginning, there was a product called M-Matcher.

1556
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,559
It's not a big

1557
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,559
media record,

1558
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,559
but we wanted to

1559
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,559
create an SMS marketplace

1560
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,559
where

1561
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,559
we would create an early version

1562
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,559
of a matching.

1563
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,559
I would sell bananas,

1564
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,559
he would buy a seed,

1565
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:07,559
and he would know it could match.

1566
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:09,559
The technology was an interesting problem.

1567
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,559
We could create

1568
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,559
relevance, scoring,

1569
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,559
and we had our own algorithms.

1570
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,559
I created a web app,

1571
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,559
then we had SMS services.

1572
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,559
That was the first time

1573
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,559
we applied to YSE.

1574
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,559
Probably 20 times already.

1575
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,559
That wasn't a problem.

1576
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,559
We got

1577
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,559
a second prize,

1578
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,559
a second place,

1579
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,559
at a Nokia event in London.

1580
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,559
Those were the scenes.

1581
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,559
Your goal was

1582
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,559
to get some

1583
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,559
funds,

1584
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,559
some capital,

1585
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,559
to strengthen the business,

1586
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,559
or

1587
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,559
to look for

1588
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,559
a way

1589
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,559
to open

1590
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,559
a door of recognition

1591
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,559
in Tuin.

1592
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,559
Everything you created,

1593
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,559
probably, in the first place,

1594
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,559
requires some capital,

1595
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,559
to escalate things,

1596
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,559
or distribution,

1597
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,559
or recognition.

1598
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,559
Back then, we were

1599
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,559
like IP2 in Slovenia.

1600
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,559
We were

1601
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,559
a young company,

1602
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,559
we needed some income

1603
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,559
to survive.

1604
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:25,559
Those were

1605
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,559
different motivations.

1606
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,559
YSE was a motivation,

1607
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,559
and then the next league.

1608
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:33,559
Everything changed.

1609
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,559
You go to an American market,

1610
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,559
American investors,

1611
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,559
and it's something else.

1612
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,559
It was like Hail Mary.

1613
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,559
But look,

1614
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,559
if you like it, you like it.

1615
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:47,559
If you don't try,

1616
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,559
we were a good team,

1617
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,559
the product was what it was,

1618
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,559
and we tried.

1619
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,559
It didn't work.

1620
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,559
There are more rounds.

1621
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,559
You apply to YSE,

1622
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,559
you get a letter,

1623
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,559
a video call,

1624
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,560
we didn't make it through.

1625
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,560
But at some point,

1626
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,560
when we decided,

1627
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
we said,

1628
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
this is not it.

1629
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
Maybe YSE would be the main reason.

1630
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
But we let it be,

1631
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
and we started doing double recall.

1632
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Maybe everyone knows that.

1633
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,560
For a while,

1634
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,560
on most of the Slovenian portals,

1635
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
we were

1636
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
trying to reach

1637
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
the American market.

1638
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
For those who don't know what it was,

1639
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,560
it was a way

1640
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,560
to pay for yourself.

1641
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,560
You don't watch

1642
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
only banners,

1643
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
but you engage with yourself.

1644
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
You had a picture,

1645
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,560
and you could re-write it.

1646
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,560
It could be a BMW,

1647
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,560
and you could re-write it.

1648
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
You dedicated more time.

1649
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,560
That's why we agreed

1650
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,560
that it was worth

1651
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
it.

1652
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,560
The advertiser doesn't have to pay more.

1653
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
It could be a micro-payment

1654
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
for an article.

1655
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
You got an ad.

1656
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,560
It was a BMW.

1657
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,560
There was a window

1658
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
where you could re-write

1659
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
on the picture.

1660
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
You got more engagement

1661
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
from the viewer.

1662
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Awareness.

1663
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Not the case

1664
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,560
with banners,

1665
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
but it could be

1666
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
something else.

1667
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
That's why we developed

1668
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,560
our own ad server,

1669
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
our own Captcha system,

1670
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,560
and a library

1671
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,560
where you could publish

1672
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
the plug-and-play notes.

1673
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,560
We also

1674
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,560
did business development.

1675
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,560
We had

1676
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,560
a 24-hour magazine

1677
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,560
and other sites.

1678
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,560
There was also

1679
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
some revenue.

1680
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Then we applied

1681
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
to YC.

1682
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
And it went

1683
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
a bit better.

1684
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
I think

1685
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,560
our hypothesis was

1686
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,560
that they liked

1687
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
the market we tried

1688
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
and that we went out

1689
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,560
and that we had some income.

1690
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Maybe it was only a month.

1691
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
But...

1692
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
It's something else.

1693
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
It's a topic

1694
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,560
that I've been thinking about.

1695
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,560
If you don't launch something

1696
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,560
that is cool and doesn't

1697
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
care about you,

1698
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,560
and doesn't give you a single euro,

1699
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,560
you'll never know anything.

1700
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,560
Anyway...

1701
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,560
In the beginning

1702
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
of 2012,

1703
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
we did

1704
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
a personal interview

1705
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,560
and we were told

1706
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,560
that we could come in.

1707
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
And it was like that.

1708
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,560
YC went through a lot of evolution.

1709
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,560
They either

1710
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,560
expanded

1711
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,560
or tried

1712
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,560
new things and structures.

1713
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,560
They took

1714
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,560
only 30 companies

1715
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,560
for half a year.

1716
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,560
We were the first batch

1717
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
and then doubled.

1718
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
There were 60 companies in the batch.

1719
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560
There was a rule

1720
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,560
that you could come to Silicon Valley

1721
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,560
for 3 months.

1722
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,560
They gave you a minimum

1723
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,560
of 15-25 euros.

1724
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,560
You could be there for 3 months

1725
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,560
and go to office hours

1726
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
and talk to people.

1727
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,560
At the end, there was a demo day.

1728
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,560
It was in front of investors

1729
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,560
and YC knew that

1730
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
they have a huge circle of

1731
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,560
respected investors

1732
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,560
and that they could see

1733
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,560
their projects.

1734
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,560
At the time,

1735
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,560
there was almost no reason

1736
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
not to get an investment.

1737
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,560
YC was such a filter

1738
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,560
that people were like,

1739
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,560
whatever.

1740
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,560
Just because you're already in it,

1741
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,560
you have a lot of potential.

1742
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,560
In this process,

1743
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,560
you got an investment.

1744
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,560
What else

1745
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,560
did they give you?

1746
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,560
Mentorship?

1747
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,560
Before we talk about mentorship,

1748
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,560
let me ask you something.

1749
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,560
What else did you have to say

1750
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,560
about the applications?

1751
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,560
In the ICO application form,

1752
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,560
there was a big drop

1753
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,560
but it changed a lot

1754
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,560
over the years.

1755
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,560
What are they looking for?

1756
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,560
Let's start with you.

1757
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
I don't remember the details

1758
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,560
but I know

1759
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,560
what people are looking for.

1760
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,560
The whole thing is

1761
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,560
people are important,

1762
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,560
ideas and everything else is not.

1763
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,560
If you have top people

1764
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,560
who are capable,

1765
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,560
who want to do something,

1766
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,560
if there is no first idea,

1767
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,560
there will be a second or third.

1768
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
Most of the questions I got

1769
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
were about the team's background,

1770
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,560
how the team gets to know each other.

1771
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,560
You can record yourself

1772
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,560
and present yourself.

1773
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,560
For us,

1774
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,560
the main thing

1775
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,560
was that

1776
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,560
they saw us

1777
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,560
from Slovenia,

1778
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,560
ambitious people.

1779
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,560
The team,

1780
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,560
not the individual,

1781
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,560
but the synergy

1782
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,560
between you

1783
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,560
and the energy

1784
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,560
of the team.

1785
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,560
That's the main thing.

1786
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,560
I know that at the ICO

1787
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,560
you can present yourself

1788
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,560
at the beginning

1789
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
without an idea

1790
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,560
and at the end

1791
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,560
it was different.

1792
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,560
It's totally normal.

1793
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,560
How long was the incubation period?

1794
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,560
Three months?

1795
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Yes, three months.

1796
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,560
But you can

1797
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,560
present yourself

1798
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,560
without an idea,

1799
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,560
with MWP

1800
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,560
or with something you already have.

1801
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,560
That's right.

1802
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,560
Everything is taken into account

1803
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,560
and it's decided.

1804
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,560
At the beginning

1805
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,560
there were two founders,

1806
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,560
because a single founder

1807
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,560
is quite difficult.

1808
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,560
You don't need to be able to

1809
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,560
do something difficult.

1810
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,560
So, yes,

1811
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,560
everything is taken into account.

1812
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,560
Is technology important to you?

1813
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,560
I've heard that

1814
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,560
companies already have

1815
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,560
revenue and business models

1816
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,560
throughout the year.

1817
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,560
Do you think that

1818
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,560
companies that already have

1819
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,560
a fit have changed?

1820
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,560
It's hard to say.

1821
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,560
It's hard to say.

1822
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,560
Also,

1823
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,560
the technology.

1824
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,560
They look at the whole package.

1825
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,560
They present

1826
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,560
the ten trends

1827
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,560
and within

1828
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,560
those ten trends

1829
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,560
it would be really cool

1830
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,560
if someone did this.

1831
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,560
But this is just

1832
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,560
a datapoint for people.

1833
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,560
At the end of the day

1834
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,560
they look at a package.

1835
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,560
In our country

1836
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,560
we were advertising.

1837
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,560
We had some kind of

1838
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,560
food delivery.

1839
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Some kind of

1840
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
mobile style for girls.

1841
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,560
You know,

1842
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,560
a totally different society.

1843
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,560
Rap Genius

1844
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,560
was in Germany.

1845
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,560
Wikipedia for rap songs.

1846
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,560
Anyone could have

1847
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,560
some kind of appeal

1848
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,560
to have some audience

1849
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,560
Oh, man.

1850
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:15,360
Apart from that, do you have a confirmation, or do you think that Jansko was accepted just because of your team?

1851
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,200
Or was the idea itself good enough to convince her?

1852
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:27,760
I'm guessing that you got some kind of investment, and Dabo said something, right?

1853
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,599
I can't say for sure. I think they said it was because of the team.

1854
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:48,320
But it definitely helped us to go out to the market, because it's a step that shows that you're serious, that you believe in yourself.

1855
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:56,880
And also that you got a one-euro note shows that there's nothing wrong with business, because if people don't pay, it's hard for people to give money from themselves.

1856
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,720
And you can do something to make it useful, or solve a problem.

1857
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:11,279
The motto of YC is to make something people want. And that's a very powerful statement.

1858
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:23,279
And now, what did YC give you? What did they give you in the package? What did you get out of it?

1859
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:34,559
It's an endless thing. For someone like us, I'm from Velenje, he's from Maribor, and also for some Slovenians,

1860
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:43,599
because we were technically more powerful, but otherwise, if you come to the American market, which is the biggest in the world,

1861
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:51,919
where the competition is the biggest, both in terms of staff and products, and you come to Slovenia, it's very, very difficult.

1862
00:51:52,639 --> 00:52:02,160
I won't be serious, maybe you'll ask me where I went to school, and I'll say University of Maribor, so you didn't go to school.

1863
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:18,160
When you said you were in YC, there was instant recognition. In Silicon Valley, it was like a badge of honor, everyone knew.

1864
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:29,839
Silicon Valley is not as big as it used to be, in New York, everyone knew. Now, more people know, because start-ups have been there for a long time.

1865
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:41,839
But yes, instant street cred among people, among investors, and also among potential partners, for example.

1866
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:50,320
That's one of the main things, because the money helps, although now they give a lot more, in the past they gave very little, but it helps.

1867
00:52:52,800 --> 00:53:01,679
So that's the main thing, the network, those people who are batchmates with you, most of those people go ahead and do crazy things.

1868
00:53:01,919 --> 00:53:07,919
Either their companies, or they are employees, and then I don't know where they are, and that network is priceless.

1869
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:19,919
Because you go from being a Slovenian and you don't know anyone, and you don't know anyone, to now you know, you have a guy on Google, then on Facebook, and so on.

1870
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:31,360
Mentorship was also great, we already went through the board with PJ, and then we went to have a great conversation, he is a very interesting person.

1871
00:53:35,919 --> 00:53:41,520
It says there, everything that Miha says is written there, right?

1872
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,880
Well, that's from the first year, what's written on the Internet?

1873
00:53:47,360 --> 00:54:01,440
No, but it's written there, that it's a daily delivery of what's written, that's what I wanted to say, but I wanted to ask you now, there are some very famous,

1874
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:13,520
those, how do you say, some, not opening hours, office hours, sorry, yes, those office hours, it says that they are recommended,

1875
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:20,559
but you shouldn't go if you think you shouldn't, but, can you tell us a little bit what those sessions look like?

1876
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:32,799
Yes, yes, I guess, yes, they are not mandatory, but as far as I know, everyone goes, religiously, folk wrote bots, that they tried to get a slot for PJ,

1877
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:43,679
because he was so busy, and everyone wanted to talk to him, you can get full invaluable advice, because there were people like, I don't know, Paul Buchheit at the time,

1878
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:52,320
who was the creator of Gmail, and you could go with him for an hour every day, if you wanted, and I, as a person, saw such a scale,

1879
00:54:52,320 --> 00:55:00,480
and such things, which I probably have never seen before, but I've seen them a few times, and you can really get some answers,

1880
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:12,399
especially since they got to know another kind of folk, right? So, yes, at those office hours, you can validate ideas, ask technical questions,

1881
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:25,440
ask for intros at the end of the day, to other technologists, I don't know if they are, you can bounce off an idea, if you see that the original idea doesn't work,

1882
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,760
you can go with them and come up with some other idea, which you did at the end, you know, just everything, right?

1883
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:38,480
But do they have domain experts for specific topics, or what does it look like?

1884
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:48,880
At the time, it wasn't that they were, you know, in some buckets, they were just folk, fully capable of some credibility, which they did create in the past,

1885
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:55,519
but they were among others, like, for example, Gary Tann is now very famous, maybe one day,

1886
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:05,279
Jean-Claude Saint-FranÃ§ois, by the way, is very popular there now, and he's not there now either, or he was the CEO of Y Combinator in the city,

1887
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:15,760
Sam Altman, everyone knows him, for example, OpenAI, he was just a kid there at the time, who also had an office hour now, and so on, right?

1888
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:25,040
Only three months is probably too long, if you have a whole lot of work.

1889
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:32,000
I mean, you came with a small team, you were a small team, you went there, a new environment,

1890
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,679
and find a place where you will eat, where you will sleep, la la la la...

1891
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,559
Was that a priority?

1892
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:51,359
I don't know, at the end of the day, you could sleep, but this mentorship, office hours,

1893
00:56:51,359 --> 00:57:01,359
working on a product, a daily, active product that people use, that was quite a lot of pressure, probably, for such a small team.

1894
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,359
You probably went there to spread it quickly, or what?

1895
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:10,239
No, we didn't spread it that much, but yeah, it was everything you said.

1896
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:16,799
I wasn't the first player in America, but I was the first to go live in America.

1897
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,320
It was mind-blowing, just because of that.

1898
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:27,040
There are some things that you only see in movies, and there was one aspect of that, because you really want to explore that scene.

1899
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:33,119
Then I was in Silicon Valley, and that was a place I never even dreamed I would ever show up there.

1900
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:39,200
I knew it existed, I knew all the cool things were happening there, but then I was there.

1901
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:45,119
So yeah, those were some kind of mental...interesting moments.

1902
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,119
Well, that must have been a shock for the team.

1903
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,119
Yeah, yeah. I mean, Valda, we were all...

1904
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,440
To acclimatize, we've been there for a month.

1905
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:01,519
Yeah, I mean, the biggest shock was when you see how hard it is to find things there, for example.

1906
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:05,519
It was like that back then, and how expensive it is, and all that.

1907
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:13,519
And how hard it is, when you're someone from Slovenia, who doesn't have any financial history or anything like that,

1908
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,519
to be able to qualify for some rents and all that.

1909
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,519
To be able to buy your own house and all that. Those things were all very interesting.

1910
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:27,600
But in the end, we found a house in, what was it, Old Palo Alto,

1911
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:33,599
where we actually stayed, four houses south of Pol Graham,

1912
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,599
and 500 meters away from Steve Jobs, who was still alive at the time.

1913
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,599
And we were there like we were in a student dormitory.

1914
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,599
Three bedrooms, four bathrooms.

1915
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,679
Yeah, when you imagine what it was like.

1916
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:55,679
We went to the market, bought a kilo of pate and some soups, we cooked ourselves.

1917
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,679
And we worked, I mean, we worked a lot.

1918
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,679
And you still had those activities every week at YCU.

1919
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:07,679
That was in Mountain View, that's where Google Headquarters is.

1920
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:09,679
And we drove there.

1921
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,679
In Pol Graham, were there any milestones?

1922
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,679
Or were you like, hey guys, welcome, we're going there in three months?

1923
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,760
Pretty much that.

1924
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,760
They trust you, that you know what you can do.

1925
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,760
And in the beginning, every friend is pretty stupid.

1926
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,760
I mean, it's not like you're satisfied with the initiative, that you came to them.

1927
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,760
If you don't do something in the end.

1928
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,760
I mean, you know that if you need help, you'll come to them, right?

1929
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,760
Yeah, kind of.

1930
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,840
How did you deal with those teams?

1931
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,840
I mean, you flew to them, you ran to them.

1932
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,840
How did you deal with each other?

1933
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,840
Did someone else come to you?

1934
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,840
Did you have that kind of interaction?

1935
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Yeah, on different levels.

1936
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,840
In our case, I don't know how much.

1937
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,840
I mean, we hung out more as a social network.

1938
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,840
You know what kind of problems you have, and how to solve them.

1939
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:11,919
Or what kind of technological things.

1940
01:00:11,919 --> 01:00:15,919
Because most of the people there were very good in terms of technology.

1941
01:00:15,919 --> 01:00:17,919
There were those interesting aspects.

1942
01:00:17,919 --> 01:00:22,919
YC is known for that kind of dogfooding.

1943
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,919
That you try to sell to other YC companies first.

1944
01:00:25,919 --> 01:00:27,919
Maybe the whole company is in your batch.

1945
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:29,919
And they assume that they are your partners.

1946
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:33,919
Or the opposite, because now they already have a couple of employees.

1947
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:37,919
In that sense, it was a lot.

1948
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It was also during their foray.

1949
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
There was a member of a company from YC.

1950
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And then, they already have those three pages.

1951
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And they are all from YC.

1952
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
But, oh well.

1953
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
That's it.

1954
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
That's the network effect.

1955
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
When you build something from scratch,

1956
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
you have to take advantage of every advantage.

1957
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Because if you don't, you're dead.

1958
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Because everything works against you.

1959
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The competition is big.

1960
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,080
You can use anything,

1961
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
because there is no other access to it.

1962
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,080
That's one example.

1963
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,080
If you have access to the YC network,

1964
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,080
if you don't use it, you're dead.

1965
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,080
But when you were there,

1966
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:22,080
did you feel like that?

1967
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,080
As you said,

1968
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,080
you went through the filter.

1969
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,080
But what you say,

1970
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
everyone is much better here.

1971
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
What are we doing here?

1972
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,080
We don't give a shit about that.

1973
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:36,159
We don't care about that.

1974
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,159
Let's go for it.

1975
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,159
Let's hear it.

1976
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,159
AndraÅ¾ still doesn't know

1977
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:44,159
Robert Farazin.

1978
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,159
I don't have to talk

1979
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,159
about Robie.

1980
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,159
I'm not talking about Robie.

1981
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:52,159
Yes.

1982
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:54,159
But,

1983
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,159
I would call it

1984
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:58,159
imposter syndrome.

1985
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:00,159
I didn't say it directly.

1986
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:02,159
I got it a few years ago.

1987
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,239
I think it's because

1988
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:06,239
I'm older.

1989
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:10,239
It definitely happened

1990
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:12,239
that you came there

1991
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:14,239
and there were a lot of people

1992
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:16,239
who graduated from MIT

1993
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:18,239
and Stanford.

1994
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,239
I didn't even include the facts,

1995
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,239
because it's not important.

1996
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,239
But deep down,

1997
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:26,239
you heard it all.

1998
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:28,239
It was a very interesting feeling

1999
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:30,239
for me,

2000
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
because I had a lot of

2001
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
imposter syndrome,

2002
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320
but the environment gave me

2003
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
a feeling that I shouldn't have it.

2004
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,320
And also,

2005
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,320
when you change with people,

2006
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,320
you can change in everything.

2007
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,320
And so,

2008
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,320
maybe it's classic imposter syndrome.

2009
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,320
I mean, you know,

2010
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,320
Do you think it's a part

2011
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
of American culture?

2012
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,320
That they encourage

2013
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,320
a little more,

2014
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,400
that's why we noticed

2015
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,400
that we could quickly change

2016
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,400
that culture.

2017
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,400
And if not,

2018
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,400
we had it later,

2019
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
through the years,

2020
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,400
with some Slovenians.

2021
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,400
Slovenians have a hard time selling themselves.

2022
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
We know a lot.

2023
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,400
So definitely, yes,

2024
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,400
it was also a part of it all.

2025
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,400
What happened

2026
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,400
after three months?

2027
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Well,

2028
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:28,479
we built a product,

2029
01:03:28,479 --> 01:03:30,479
a dashboard,

2030
01:03:30,479 --> 01:03:32,479
so advertisers

2031
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,479
could self-manage

2032
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:36,479
the ads and all that.

2033
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,479
And we prepared for that demo.

2034
01:03:38,479 --> 01:03:40,479
We didn't pivot.

2035
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:42,479
In Slovenia, the story developed

2036
01:03:42,479 --> 01:03:44,479
because this is the Laufell server.

2037
01:03:44,479 --> 01:03:46,479
In America, we tried

2038
01:03:46,479 --> 01:03:48,479
some business development.

2039
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,479
We tried to connect the contacts

2040
01:03:50,479 --> 01:03:52,479
so that maybe some sites would come.

2041
01:03:52,479 --> 01:03:54,479
But going to the daily.cn is not the same

2042
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,559
as going to the traffic.com.

2043
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,559
So now we don't know

2044
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,559
how to connect them.

2045
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,559
But also because of

2046
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,559
the work you do as a business,

2047
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,559
or because of

2048
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,559
the stack size,

2049
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,559
where do you see

2050
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,559
the biggest problem?

2051
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,559
I think the biggest problem

2052
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,559
is that there is a scale.

2053
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,559
And the scale of their traffic

2054
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,559
may be the scale of the company.

2055
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,559
And when the company is big and serious,

2056
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,640
everything lasts longer.

2057
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,640
Before you even know

2058
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,640
the right people, it lasts.

2059
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,640
And in those three months,

2060
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,640
you won't go anywhere.

2061
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,640
The YC network doesn't help you that much.

2062
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,640
But we found each other

2063
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,640
in some kind of nature.

2064
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,640
We prepared

2065
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,640
for different demos.

2066
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,640
I know I worked on that.

2067
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,640
You were in Rubio,

2068
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,640
you did some kind of proxy

2069
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:52,719
or double recall project

2070
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:54,719
on any site you wanted.

2071
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:56,719
It was a live script

2072
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:58,719
that was running on your server.

2073
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:00,719
You took cnn.com

2074
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:02,719
and gave it the URL.

2075
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,719
It was looking for a member,

2076
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:06,719
it was logged in,

2077
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:08,719
and it clicked the double recall.

2078
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:10,719
We had a lot of sites,

2079
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:12,719
Fortune, CNN,

2080
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:14,719
and that's what we did

2081
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:16,719
when we went to meetings.

2082
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:18,719
We tried everything

2083
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,799
in a technological way

2084
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,799
to get closer.

2085
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,799
At the end of the day, this technology

2086
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,799
has nothing to do with business.

2087
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,799
Products for publishers.

2088
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,799
Products for publishers

2089
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,799
for news sites,

2090
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,799
for publishers that publish content

2091
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,799
and give it for free.

2092
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,799
But now there are users

2093
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,799
who choose that.

2094
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,799
And advertisers.

2095
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,880
Three of the most important

2096
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,880
stakeholders are.

2097
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,880
And probably

2098
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
I don't know

2099
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,880
media

2100
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,880
as such have a hard time

2101
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
paying them.

2102
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
It's been a hundred years

2103
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,880
digital has forgotten them.

2104
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,880
Whatever.

2105
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,880
All this space

2106
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,880
in the last ten years

2107
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,880
has been a little hard

2108
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
with monetization.

2109
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,960
Do you think there is a hypothesis

2110
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,960
on the internet

2111
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,960
or do you think there was

2112
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,960
more of a problem

2113
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,960
that people were

2114
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,960
held back

2115
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,960
or

2116
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,960
they don't have food?

2117
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,960
Or do you really think

2118
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,960
it's more of a business problem?

2119
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,960
I think it's primarily a business problem.

2120
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,960
But a business problem

2121
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,960
also in the sense

2122
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,039
that from a business point of view

2123
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,039
the hardest problem there is

2124
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,039
where you have three different stakeholders.

2125
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,039
In fact, you can make a marketplace

2126
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,039
where you get all this.

2127
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,039
Unless you connect

2128
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,039
with some ad network or something.

2129
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,039
But at the moment we started

2130
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,039
we didn't think about it all.

2131
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,039
We just had some idea

2132
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,040
we saw how fast we can do it

2133
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,040
and how fast we can make a prototype

2134
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,040
that people can start using

2135
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,040
and some traction would be in Slovenia.

2136
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,119
Because of all these problems

2137
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,119
we stopped

2138
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,119
after three months.

2139
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,119
So what happened

2140
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,119
after three months was

2141
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,119
a demo day at YCU

2142
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,119
where we raised

2143
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,119
1.6 million

2144
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,119
from investors

2145
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,119
and at first

2146
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,119
we had a plan to do something

2147
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,119
but then we realized

2148
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,119
that this business

2149
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:41,199
we weren't passionate about

2150
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:43,199
it would take too long

2151
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:45,199
and the odds of success

2152
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:47,199
were low.

2153
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:49,199
And then

2154
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,199
we decided to try something else.

2155
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:53,199
And then you pivoted

2156
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,199
for this investment?

2157
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,199
Yes.

2158
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,199
Now let's drink a glass of water

2159
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:01,199
and I will cook some meat.

2160
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,199
Let's move on.

2161
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:07,199
Mihas is probably also

2162
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,280
taking a break.

2163
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,280
I would like to thank

2164
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,280
our Patreons

2165
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280
who support us on this mission

2166
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,280
and help us

2167
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,280
to make episodes on this level.

2168
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,280
I would also like to thank

2169
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,280
3FSE,

2170
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,280
Caldi and Humanfrog

2171
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,280
who are our partners

2172
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,280
and support us on this path

2173
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,280
because of these companies

2174
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,280
and employees who support us

2175
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,280
we can work on this level.

2176
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,359
Like and subscribe

2177
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,359
if we have more followers on YouTube

2178
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,359
check out Premium Sebin

2179
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,359
and also for Patreon

2180
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,359
if there are more people

2181
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,359
we can do Premium Exclusive Sebin.

2182
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,359
That was EPP.

2183
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,359
We can also go to Discord

2184
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,359
there are more than 700 people

2185
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,359
so you can join

2186
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,359
and talk

2187
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,359
and chat.

2188
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,359
Did I forget something?

2189
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,359
No, I think that's it.

2190
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,439
So,

2191
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,439
after YCO

2192
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,439
after this story

2193
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,439
how did I manage

2194
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,439
from Robert's CV

2195
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,439
and your CV

2196
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,439
and your team's CV

2197
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,439
you went

2198
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,439
to do other projects

2199
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,439
then I think you did

2200
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,439
Dubjoy

2201
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,439
if I remember correctly

2202
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,439
which was a tool

2203
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,439
for making subtitles for videos

2204
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,520
for voiceover

2205
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,520
and some

2206
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,520
different projects

2207
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,520
then we go

2208
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,520
to some points

2209
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,520
to milestones

2210
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,520
I won't say

2211
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,520
that it's a trivial path

2212
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,520
but that's what I know

2213
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,520
then you go to Coinbase

2214
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,520
and if I understand correctly

2215
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,520
you were healthy before that

2216
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,520
and with Coinbase

2217
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,520
you went from bad

2218
01:09:59,599 --> 01:10:01,599
I think if I understand correctly

2219
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:03,599
you went from a startup

2220
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,599
to a company

2221
01:10:05,599 --> 01:10:07,599
that had

2222
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:09,599
2015 I think

2223
01:10:09,599 --> 01:10:11,599
made a company IPO

2224
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:13,599
and I think it's worth 10 billion dollars

2225
01:10:13,599 --> 01:10:15,599
or something

2226
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:17,599
it's a very big real company

2227
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,599
that's on the stock market

2228
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:21,599
and it's one of the dominant

2229
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:23,599
players in crypto

2230
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:25,599
in the crypto world

2231
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:27,599
and

2232
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,680
if I understand correctly

2233
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,680
early days are very connected

2234
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,680
with Bitcoin

2235
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,680
and that's it

2236
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,680
tell us a little bit more

2237
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,680
how did that transition in Coinbase look like

2238
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,680
and is Coinbase

2239
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,680
now that you already had a startup

2240
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,680
look completely different

2241
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,680
experience

2242
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,680
was it the same as Robert Parazin

2243
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,680
no

2244
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,680
it's done

2245
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,760
in the beginning

2246
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,760
we tried

2247
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,760
to pivot

2248
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,760
every month

2249
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,760
a new product

2250
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,760
we didn't fully launch them

2251
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,760
we didn't validate them on the market

2252
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,760
because we always found something else

2253
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,760
we were all over the place

2254
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,760
at the end there was Dubjoy for voiceover

2255
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,760
and we worked on it for a while

2256
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,760
it was technologically very interesting

2257
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,760
but in May

2258
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,760
Bitcoin white paper came

2259
01:11:23,839 --> 01:11:25,839
and

2260
01:11:25,839 --> 01:11:27,839
I also changed it

2261
01:11:27,839 --> 01:11:29,839
and it was so mind blown

2262
01:11:29,839 --> 01:11:31,839
and

2263
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,839
I don't know

2264
01:11:33,839 --> 01:11:35,839
why

2265
01:11:35,839 --> 01:11:37,839
why was it so special

2266
01:11:37,839 --> 01:11:39,839
what was special about it

2267
01:11:39,839 --> 01:11:41,839
you didn't change it

2268
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,839
you must have seen it

2269
01:11:43,839 --> 01:11:45,839
but it didn't have that epiphany

2270
01:11:45,839 --> 01:11:47,839
I don't know

2271
01:11:47,839 --> 01:11:49,839
but it was interesting

2272
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:51,839
DJ Chach could record a video

2273
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,920
and that's it

2274
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,920
they are a bit greedy

2275
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,920
I don't know

2276
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,920
maybe the concept of Bitcoin

2277
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,920
that it merged

2278
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,920
more spheres

2279
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,920
financial, cryptographic

2280
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,920
and technological

2281
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,920
or maybe distributed systems

2282
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,920
as you would call it

2283
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,920
and

2284
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,920
inside I knew

2285
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,920
that there are problems

2286
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
with Byzantine generals

2287
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and things like that

2288
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and it fascinated me

2289
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
how

2290
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
all

2291
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
edge cases were predicted

2292
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
and said that it will be like that

2293
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and that's why the supply of Bitcoin is limited

2294
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
to only 21 million

2295
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and

2296
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
something was there

2297
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and it attracted me a lot

2298
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and I wanted to know more

2299
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
at that time I bought a few

2300
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:50,079
and

2301
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:52,079
when I wanted to buy them

2302
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:54,079
I went to Hacker News

2303
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,079
that Coinbase launched

2304
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:58,079
and that it's easy to buy Bitcoin in America

2305
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:00,079
and I said I'll try

2306
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:02,079
and Coinbase was

2307
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:04,079
Rails App

2308
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,079
with Bootstrap CSS

2309
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:08,079
and

2310
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:10,079
that was the question

2311
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:12,079
is that also on Rails

2312
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:14,079
is that exchange also on Rails

2313
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:16,079
and yeah

2314
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,160
check

2315
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,160
and that's why

2316
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,160
RDChanit

2317
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,160
but

2318
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,160
at that time I bought

2319
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,160
a few Bitcoins

2320
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,160
you were already in America

2321
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,160
you moved there

2322
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,160
it was a bit complicated

2323
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,160
there were some times

2324
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,160
I went back

2325
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,160
because life was too expensive

2326
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,160
we lived in New York

2327
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,160
but then I was in Ljubljana

2328
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,239
I was in America

2329
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,239
in San Francisco

2330
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,239
when we bought Whitepaper

2331
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,239
but then I moved back to Slovenia

2332
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,239
we can talk about that later

2333
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,239
but

2334
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,239
yeah

2335
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,239
then in Whitepaper

2336
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,239
I had some questions

2337
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,239
about

2338
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,239
some things

2339
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,239
and when I saw

2340
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,239
and I saw

2341
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,239
that Coinbase is also in YCU

2342
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:14,319
once YCU, always YCU

2343
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:16,319
so

2344
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,319
I started to contact

2345
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,319
the founder of YCU

2346
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:22,319
and I asked

2347
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:24,319
Brian Armstrong

2348
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:26,319
if he has time for a coffee

2349
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:28,319
so I can ask him about Bitcoins

2350
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:30,319
and he said yes

2351
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:32,319
we'll meet in a week for a coffee

2352
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,319
and he'll start to recruit me

2353
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:36,319
I just wanted to ask him

2354
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:38,319
a few things

2355
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:40,319
we were still working

2356
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,400
I was only interested in a few things

2357
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,400
he had a different mission

2358
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,400
he had a completely different mission

2359
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,400
and it was very interesting

2360
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,400
but nothing

2361
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,400
we made a nice change

2362
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,400
at that time Coinbase was only him

2363
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,400
I was still the founder

2364
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,400
and nothing

2365
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,400
then I thought

2366
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,400
that DubJoy

2367
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,400
is something else

2368
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,400
and I thought

2369
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,400
maybe

2370
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I went to Slovenia, I met Brian a couple of times,

2371
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
every time I told him enthusiastically what I was programming on Dubjoy,

2372
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
he just looked and nodded, and wrote some notes.

2373
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And one evening, here in Ljubljana, I was going to sleep,

2374
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
it was almost night, I almost made a mistake in the call,

2375
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
but I see a phone call, an American number, let's call.

2376
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Hello, this is Brian Armstrong.

2377
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And he made a whole speech on the phone,

2378
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
and in a week or so I flew to America for a work trial.

2379
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
At the time they had, and if you had served for a long time,

2380
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
it would have been great for you, they had these work trials,

2381
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
because you came to work with them for a week,

2382
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
to see how you vibe together, and what you know how to do.

2383
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
One week I flew to that, and a little later I...

2384
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
The time was just right, it was a few months after we first met.

2385
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Dubjoy also looked like it wasn't going to be a business.

2386
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Bitcoin was always more interesting to me, the price grew,

2387
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
it fell a little, it grew a little, and it was like that.

2388
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I couldn't resist it.

2389
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yeah.

2390
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And yeah, Coinbase was, when I went to the work trial,

2391
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
there were five of them.

2392
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Then I could wait for the visa for so long,

2393
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
because I needed a new visa.

2394
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
That's a whole podcast about American visas.

2395
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I waited for the visa for so long,

2396
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
that when I got there, there were already 30 or something.

2397
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So officially, I don't know where the employee number is,

2398
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
but somewhere between 5 and 20, I would say.

2399
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
And yeah, I think that when I went to the work trial,

2400
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
it was just something else.

2401
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
We were the four Slovenians who went there,

2402
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
and we tried, and we were okay in some words,

2403
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
but it was just something else.

2404
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I went there, and there were only Americans here.

2405
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
This was business development from day one.

2406
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I coded something there.

2407
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
He was there on the line from Wikipedia

2408
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
to prepare donations in Bitcoin.

2409
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I knew Wikipedia, it was a big deal.

2410
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And so, I don't know, it was just a different vibe.

2411
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And if we're talking about Bitcoin,

2412
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
it was 2014 at the beginning.

2413
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Bitcoin was very sketchy back then.

2414
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Yeah.

2415
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
But there was some energy,

2416
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and you couldn't overlook it.

2417
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And yeah, I don't know.

2418
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It made all the sense to me.

2419
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And yeah, it was a Rails app,

2420
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and I was at the top of my expertise in Rails at the time.

2421
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And we shipped the feature there.

2422
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
You shipped the whole feature individually,

2423
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
design, full stack.

2424
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It just worked.

2425
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
But during that time,

2426
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
there were some exchanges.

2427
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
All of them existed.

2428
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Coinbase wasn't the first.

2429
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
But maybe you remember,

2430
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I don't know,

2431
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
why they were in YCO.

2432
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
What was that added value

2433
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
that they used to attack the Bitcoin market

2434
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
and say, we're so much better now.

2435
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
If you remember.

2436
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yeah, definitely.

2437
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Because it's still a pitch.

2438
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And yeah, there were exchanges for Bitcoin.

2439
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
You had LocalBitcoin,

2440
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
where you exchanged with someone

2441
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
on the street.

2442
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Yeah, I also exchanged my first Bitcoin.

2443
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And you'd say, great,

2444
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
but not for everyone.

2445
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Not for everyone.

2446
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And here's the pitch.

2447
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Brian could see,

2448
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
he could believe,

2449
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
this is the future.

2450
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
But if this is the future,

2451
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
let's make something

2452
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
that everyone can get

2453
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
and trade

2454
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
and do anything

2455
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
with cryptocurrencies.

2456
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And all of this is called ease of use.

2457
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
It's totally dead simple to do this.

2458
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And the second thing

2459
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
is that it's a domestic US company.

2460
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Because again,

2461
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
it's a huge deal

2462
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
for various reasons,

2463
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
especially for regulatory reasons.

2464
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
The US has the biggest

2465
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
financial regulation in the world.

2466
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And before that,

2467
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
no exchange had been in the US.

2468
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
The biggest before that

2469
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
was Mt. Gox,

2470
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
which was based in Japan.

2471
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
A Frenchman started it.

2472
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Funny story.

2473
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
When I was at a work trial

2474
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
at Coinbase, it went bankrupt.

2475
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And people lost it.

2476
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
In today's Bitcoin,

2477
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
it's worth billions.

2478
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And it illustrated

2479
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
the need for a legit player.

2480
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Because yes,

2481
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
the technology is legit,

2482
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
it's full high-tech,

2483
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
but you can make it safe,

2484
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
accessible and all that.

2485
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And that was Coinbase's pitch.

2486
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
But Coinbase's money

2487
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
went back

2488
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
to the IPO

2489
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
in 2004-2005,

2490
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
or something like that.

2491
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
That was...

2492
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Yes, almost.

2493
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
When you came to me,

2494
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
there were more people inside,

2495
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and it was a normal space.

2496
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It went through Corona.

2497
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Yes, but I'm not there anymore.

2498
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
If you pick Fiat,

2499
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
it goes fast.

2500
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Yes.

2501
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
If we talk about YCL,

2502
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
and all the start-ups,

2503
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
it's a story

2504
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
of an ideal start-up.

2505
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
One or two founders,

2506
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
idea, pitch, market,

2507
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
timing is good,

2508
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
boom, boom, boom.

2509
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Logistic growth.

2510
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Exactly.

2511
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I feel incredibly happy

2512
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
that I was a part of it.

2513
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Because as you said,

2514
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
a percentage of people

2515
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
who made it,

2516
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
if you look at the percentage

2517
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
of companies that made it,

2518
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
culminating in a successful IPO,

2519
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
it's still

2520
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
an infinite number.

2521
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And I feel

2522
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
very grateful

2523
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
that the stars have met.

2524
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It's crazy.

2525
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
But your role as an engineer

2526
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
has probably changed a lot

2527
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
through that rapid growth.

2528
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Did you go into

2529
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
management roles

2530
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
or were you still

2531
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Mike on the rails?

2532
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Everything.

2533
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
We went through hyper-growth

2534
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
in one moment.

2535
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It wasn't linear.

2536
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Let me explain

2537
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
what hyper-growth looks like

2538
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
in a company like that.

2539
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Do you have people

2540
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
who went through it a few times

2541
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and are still mentoring you?

2542
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It's like fire everywhere.

2543
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I wish.

2544
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
In the first year,

2545
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
we were just a normal company.

2546
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
We grew maybe

2547
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
twice, but when you go from 30

2548
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
to 60,

2549
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
it's not a big deal.

2550
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
The human mind

2551
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
can comprehend.

2552
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Then came a moment

2553
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
when I was 5 years old,

2554
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
2016,

2555
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
but I know about the Bitcoin price.

2556
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
When Bitcoin went up to $6,000,

2557
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
that was the first

2558
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
hype that

2559
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
spread so much

2560
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that there was a frenzy

2561
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and everyone wanted to buy it.

2562
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
We made a lot of money

2563
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and lost everything

2564
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
because all servers fell down

2565
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and scaling was fun.

2566
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Then we went all-in

2567
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
in scaling the company.

2568
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Business flow is growing,

2569
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
now we can hire a million people

2570
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
and maybe it will get better.

2571
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Was it decided?

2572
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Why yes, why mostly no.

2573
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I think the ideal company

2574
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
is a small company

2575
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
that is super technical

2576
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and solves huge problems

2577
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
with technology.

2578
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
If you scale people,

2579
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
it's hard.

2580
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You have to manage it

2581
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and coordinate

2582
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
at the end of the day.

2583
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Or motivate.

2584
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
How do you

2585
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
maintain

2586
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
that

2587
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
innovation

2588
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
in that segment?

2589
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
In a very short time,

2590
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
you have to move

2591
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
quickly,

2592
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
quickly on a large scale,

2593
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
things go quickly.

2594
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Do you have anything interesting

2595
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
to add?

2596
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
The interesting thing is

2597
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
that we didn't move

2598
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
that quickly.

2599
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
At the beginning,

2600
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
when you scale smaller,

2601
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
you move faster.

2602
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
When the company is smaller,

2603
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
everything is less serious

2604
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
and it's easier.

2605
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
You can see

2606
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
how much

2607
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
regulation

2608
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
was preventing you.

2609
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Yes, it was a factor.

2610
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It didn't prevent me

2611
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
as much as

2612
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
the stakes were higher.

2613
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Constantly.

2614
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Every time

2615
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
you wrote a code,

2616
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
it felt like money

2617
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
was being touched by people

2618
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
who trusted you.

2619
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It's very different

2620
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
from voting.

2621
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So,

2622
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
we wrote a lot of tests

2623
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
and all that stuff.

2624
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Can we go a little deeper?

2625
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I know that

2626
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
time is running out,

2627
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
but technically

2628
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I know that

2629
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
time is running out,

2630
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
but technically...

2631
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
No, no, I'm good.

2632
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Miha is still a bit young.

2633
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Yes, that's true.

2634
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
We are a bit of a tag-team

2635
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
in the podcast.

2636
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Tell us a little

2637
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
about

2638
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
the architecture

2639
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
or the developer

2640
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
experience.

2641
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
How much time and energy

2642
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
did you put in

2643
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
to make the developers

2644
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
change the features faster?

2645
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Give us a few examples

2646
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
so people can understand

2647
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
what can be done to make it faster.

2648
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
We didn't have a lot of time

2649
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
because there were a lot of things.

2650
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
We'll give

2651
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Jan an extra

2652
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
so he won't

2653
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
get mad.

2654
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
We were

2655
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
working on it.

2656
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It was

2657
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
top of mind.

2658
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I could have done more, but

2659
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
automated tests

2660
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
were one of the biggest

2661
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
things.

2662
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Investing in

2663
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
fast tests

2664
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
was a big part of it.

2665
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
If we needed

2666
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
50 machines to parallelize

2667
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
the tests,

2668
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
we could do it.

2669
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It directly correlated

2670
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
with how fast you can

2671
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
move as a developer.

2672
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
It was important

2673
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
that we had all the critical

2674
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
flows,

2675
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
because you can change the code

2676
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
very quickly.

2677
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
In the beginning,

2678
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
it was a big investment,

2679
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
but you get a lot of dividends

2680
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
because you can move

2681
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
very quickly.

2682
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
When you hire new people,

2683
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
it's scary.

2684
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
You move like you're going to break something.

2685
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
But if you know you have the tests behind you,

2686
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
it's much easier.

2687
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Later on,

2688
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
two or three years later,

2689
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I invested in Heroku

2690
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
which is another company.

2691
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
When we had 100 employees,

2692
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
it was a good push.

2693
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Later on,

2694
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
when we became a real company,

2695
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
we moved to our own infrastructure.

2696
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
At AWS, we developed

2697
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
our own system for deploying

2698
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
those services,

2699
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
which was Docker Base.

2700
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
There,

2701
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
there was a big impact

2702
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
that an engineer could

2703
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
create a new service.

2704
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You can go through security,

2705
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
maybe infrastructure,

2706
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
but you can also start

2707
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
development,

2708
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
deploy a new service.

2709
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
We had a big impact

2710
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
because

2711
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
technology can help here.

2712
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
People are nice in a different way.

2713
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
That's a different story.

2714
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
We saw that before,

2715
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
that you don't have a positive manager.

2716
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Small teams, full of capable people.

2717
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
How did you organize your teams?

2718
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
To be effective?

2719
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
On what basis?

2720
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
When we went through hyperscale,

2721
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
there was

2722
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
endless permutations.

2723
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
In the beginning,

2724
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
we were two product teams,

2725
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
each with 6-7 engineers.

2726
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
One was in Kerbryan,

2727
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
one in another.

2728
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Each of those engineers

2729
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
had their own huge feature

2730
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
that developed them.

2731
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Huge feature.

2732
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Later on,

2733
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
in a bigger company,

2734
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
20-50 people would work on it.

2735
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
In the meantime,

2736
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
they hacked it themselves.

2737
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
For almost the whole first year,

2738
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I was alone on a huge project.

2739
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
There were a few milestones,

2740
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
but I didn't do it.

2741
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I was in that project.

2742
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Now, when you look back,

2743
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
it's crazy.

2744
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
A designer might have helped

2745
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
to do something,

2746
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
but that was it.

2747
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Later on, we went through

2748
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
the classic Silicon Valley

2749
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
organizational stories.

2750
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
KPI.

2751
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You focus on the product

2752
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
or the functions.

2753
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
We tried everything.

2754
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
What did you say

2755
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
when you said

2756
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
this is where we learned.

2757
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
To pull out

2758
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
what was

2759
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
almost the same.

2760
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
One very interesting anecdote

2761
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
that is not publicly known,

2762
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
but it's not something

2763
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
everyone knows,

2764
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
is that...

2765
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I have to step back

2766
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
to explain

2767
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
what Coinbase was at the time.

2768
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Coinbase was not an exchange.

2769
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
It was a brokerage.

2770
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
The difference between an exchange

2771
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
and a brokerage is that a brokerage

2772
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
is easy to manage.

2773
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
You buy a Bitcoin,

2774
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
we do some magic,

2775
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
we tell you it will cost you this much,

2776
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
we will pay you this much,

2777
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
you say OK, and you get it.

2778
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
But in the back, a brokerage

2779
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
does a lot of things.

2780
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
A brokerage on your behalf,

2781
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
on the exchange,

2782
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
gets some money,

2783
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
and then you have to deliver it

2784
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to the exchange.

2785
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Coinbase was originally a brokerage.

2786
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
We used other exchanges,

2787
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
for example Bitstamp,

2788
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
which is an interesting Slovenian company.

2789
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Among others.

2790
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
But we soon realized

2791
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
that we would need our own exchange

2792
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
to be competitive.

2793
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
When we started doing this,

2794
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
we did...

2795
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Brian had an idea

2796
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
that we would have an internal competitor.

2797
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
A brokerage

2798
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
against an exchange.

2799
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
We would split things a bit

2800
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
when it comes to functions.

2801
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
They would have their own

2802
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
head of engineering.

2803
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And then we would fight.

2804
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Just like Google wants

2805
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
two nights of work

2806
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
to be the same.

2807
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I don't know if that's the case.

2808
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I don't think so.

2809
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Interesting approach.

2810
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
It's not the best idea.

2811
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I don't know.

2812
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
You split

2813
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
scarce resources of a company.

2814
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
You split it into camps.

2815
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And now the structure

2816
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
is completely different

2817
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
than it used to be.

2818
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
But it was cool

2819
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
for me personally

2820
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
for a while.

2821
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I started with

2822
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Rails.

2823
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I did it for a while.

2824
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
But the biggest change

2825
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
was that I went to the exchange.

2826
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I was

2827
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
the head of engineering

2828
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
of the exchange.

2829
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It was Node, Microservices,

2830
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
completely different from

2831
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Rails Monolith.

2832
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
It was cool for me

2833
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
because I had more options.

2834
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I could hire there.

2835
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
But as a structure

2836
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
it wasn't the same.

2837
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Fortunately, I could do it all the time.

2838
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Just like that.

2839
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Do you want to talk about Coinbase?

2840
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I wanted to watch Coinbase.

2841
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I had a question.

2842
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I wanted to talk about Coinbase.

2843
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Your last position

2844
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
in Coinbase was...

2845
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
What did you write?

2846
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Special project.

2847
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
The last title was...

2848
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
You didn't write the title,

2849
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
but you wrote

2850
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Engineering Special Projects

2851
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and then you wrote Reporting directly to CTO.

2852
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I don't know if it's the same

2853
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
as the guest said at the beginning

2854
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
that if you don't want to talk about certain topics

2855
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
you skip it.

2856
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Is it a secret project?

2857
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Or is it like

2858
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
we made it, just

2859
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
hack your own things.

2860
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
No, no.

2861
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
It's all public now.

2862
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I'm interested in the change.

2863
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I can change this.

2864
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
The best thing about Coinbase

2865
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
was the first year

2866
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
and the last year.

2867
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
In my opinion...

2868
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
It was fucked up.

2869
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It was fucked up.

2870
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
The first year

2871
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
because it was a small team.

2872
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
We got to know each other,

2873
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
we ate together,

2874
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
we were there all day.

2875
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
We were all true believers.

2876
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Everyone who was at Coinbase in 2014

2877
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
was a hardcore believer

2878
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and all-in.

2879
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Then you have

2880
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
career people and so on.

2881
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Last year

2882
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
you gain so much

2883
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
credibility in the organization

2884
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
and you get to know

2885
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
all the executives.

2886
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
If you're still an engineer

2887
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
or a manager.

2888
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
You have a lot of

2889
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
space to do whatever you want.

2890
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
At one point

2891
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
when I was there

2892
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
at the beginning

2893
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
they said

2894
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
what if you do this?

2895
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
They let us

2896
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
launch USDC

2897
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
which is a stable coin

2898
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
at Coinbase

2899
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
in

2900
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
two weeks.

2901
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
At Coinbase

2902
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
there were already 2000 people.

2903
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
To launch something in two weeks

2904
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
in a company with 2000 people

2905
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
is quite

2906
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
a challenge.

2907
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
It was possible

2908
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
only because we were there

2909
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
to launch it.

2910
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
We have direct trust

2911
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
of the whole company

2912
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
to help.

2913
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
We went back to war mode

2914
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
in a company with 2000 people.

2915
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
COO

2916
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
said

2917
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
drop everything

2918
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
in two weeks we'll launch USDC.

2919
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Miha and his colleague

2920
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Lidata

2921
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
help them

2922
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
and they did it.

2923
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
We had an office

2924
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
for two weeks

2925
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and we launched it.

2926
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
After those years

2927
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
when everything was

2928
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
getting slower

2929
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
when you knew less people

2930
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
at the company

2931
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
it was back to the roots.

2932
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
It was serious.

2933
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
It was crazy.

2934
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It was fast

2935
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
to launch it.

2936
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
To challenge it.

2937
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Funny how that works.

2938
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
It was a lesson.

2939
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
They gave us

2940
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
a financial incentive

2941
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
but that's it.

2942
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
That's how you do things.

2943
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
We launched it.

2944
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
To be time cautious

2945
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
our city

2946
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
is still a small company

2947
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
small start-up

2948
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
small organization.

2949
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Jira

2950
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
is too big for us.

2951
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
We heard that Linear

2952
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
is the successor

2953
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
of Jira.

2954
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Thank you for your work on Linear.

2955
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Is it for us?

2956
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Yes.

2957
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Jira is not for nobody.

2958
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
You are small, not big.

2959
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Linear is great.

2960
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I think

2961
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
it's a progressive UI

2962
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
that looks like a trailer

2963
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
when you go inside.

2964
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
But then you realize

2965
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
you need more.

2966
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
On the basis of that

2967
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
it's a sleek modern UI

2968
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
local

2969
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
first sync engine

2970
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
everything is real-time

2971
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
multiplayer

2972
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
top shit.

2973
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And inside

2974
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
is a part of Slovenian knowledge.

2975
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
That's true.

2976
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Miha

2977
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
you have the opportunity

2978
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
to talk about

2979
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
the beginnings of Slovenian

2980
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
programmers, students

2981
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
and also experienced cats.

2982
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Do you have anything to say?

2983
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It's a clichÃ©

2984
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
but I guess

2985
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
we know more

2986
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
when we get to know each other.

2987
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I think that's not the case anymore

2988
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
because with the remote work

2989
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
only most Slovenes

2990
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
are working for Twin.

2991
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
We all know that.

2992
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But don't be afraid to go outside

2993
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and

2994
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
if you want to make

2995
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
a real story, you have to go outside.

2996
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Because Europe

2997
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
is not here for

2998
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
technology.

2999
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Unified market

3000
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
different languages

3001
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
etc.

3002
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Plus, I don't know

3003
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
America is

3004
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
for making big stories.

3005
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Incubators are

3006
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
working

3007
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
helping

3008
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
so if people have ideas

3009
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
no problem.

3010
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I also

3011
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
still live in America

3012
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
but I'm also here so I'm happy

3013
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
if someone needs the world

3014
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
buy paper

3015
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
or whatever

3016
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I'm happy to help

3017
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
and I'm also

3018
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
an angel investor

3019
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
so if someone needs

3020
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Zagonski Capital

3021
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I'm happy to help.

3022
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I agree with you.

3023
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
From my point of view

3024
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
what else do you have in mind?

3025
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I mean

3026
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
somehow

3027
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
outside of

3028
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Marseille as a listener

3029
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
the story of success

3030
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
which is a little changed

3031
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
but it's still

3032
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
a grind.

3033
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
It didn't happen overnight.

3034
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
We came from 90 minutes

3035
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
overnight

3036
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
yesterday to today.

3037
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
But

3038
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
probably you're not

3039
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
calm

3040
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
you still have

3041
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
some goals

3042
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
to achieve.

3043
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I would like to, yes. At the moment I am semi-retired, but not forever.

3044
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I had a haircut recently, and now I'm picking up books.

3045
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I also have a contract for Linear.

3046
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
But yes, I would like to do something in the future.

3047
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But I don't feel like it. I'm a bit older now.

3048
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
That's a bit of a problem when you're older.

3049
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Do you have any plans to move to crypto?

3050
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
To Web 3.0 or in the same direction?

3051
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
No.

3052
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Not that there would be anything wrong with it,

3053
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
but Coinbase was such an intense experience

3054
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
that you're a bit burned out from the ecosystem.

3055
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Everyone gives some kind of startup experience,

3056
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
but it's never more.

3057
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And then there's crypto, which is probably even more intense.

3058
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Yes, exactly.

3059
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
But the counterpoint is, for example,

3060
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
that I went to Linear almost immediately after Coinbase,

3061
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
because there were only four of us.

3062
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
They are three, they are co-founders, and I was a first employee.

3063
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
And that was a startup again.

3064
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
But it was totally opposite of Coinbase.

3065
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
We were all experienced ex-founders.

3066
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
We all had some financial background.

3067
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
We didn't have to worry about where we would eat.

3068
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And then at the end you see that if the right team,

3069
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
everything has to fit, the right idea,

3070
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
but a startup doesn't have to be full grind,

3071
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
full hectic, and I don't know what.

3072
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Linear is like that, I don't know.

3073
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
People go at their own pace.

3074
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
The company was doing phenomenally,

3075
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
and the current valuation is already 400 million.

3076
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
And Djiren did a great job.

3077
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
So, yes.

3078
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
You get a head start when you're a little smarter.

3079
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
But that's the seniority level.

3080
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
A little bit of gray hair.

3081
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
At this point, we would like to conclude.

3082
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Miha, thank you for being with us

3083
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
for a part of your life journey.

3084
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
We wish you all the best in other vlogs.

3085
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
And I hope you'll still be rails,

3086
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
as you said, 5, 6, 7 years old.

3087
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I hope so.

3088
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
AndraÅ¾, thank you for your time.

3089
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
At this point, thank you to all listeners and viewers

3090
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
for being with us.

3091
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Give us some feedback.

3092
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
We appreciate it, and we hear and see the future.

3093
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
And now we're going to have a beer.

3094
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And thank you, Kaldi, for being with us.

3095
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Thank you for the interview.

3096
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Good luck to all of us.

3097
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Bye.
