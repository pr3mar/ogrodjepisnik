1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome to the new episode of Grodje. Thank you for taking the time to attend such a big conference with almost 400 people.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
As an organizer, co-organizer, all-round, operational organizer of marketing, it's a lot of work.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, I will try to respect your time and maybe a little shorter episode than usual, but I hope that we will discuss some interesting topics for our listeners as investigators and participants of some conferences.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome to Grodje. I hope that today we will discuss how to make a successful conference like Makeit.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's start with some practical examples. Maybe I will try to ask some practical questions so that I can see how you are doing.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You have been very successful, if I understand correctly, since 1998.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And now, greetings to you. I would like to start with the first question.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I would like to know who you are, what you do and how did you come to Makeit.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Maybe Elisabeta?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you. My name is Elisabeta Gruden. I came to this conference because I was employed at Oracle for 10 years.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Today, I also spoke with a colleague from Oracle. We were so young then that this came to our heart, soul and body and we simply can't do without it.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Of course, the feedback from the participants, when we are successful, gives us motivation to move forward.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Great.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I joined the company a bit later. I think it was in 2011. The last conference was in Bernardino.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I joined the company because my long-time colleague, Janez Zaletel, was a long-term chairman of the Oracle users association.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I joined the company, assisted a bit in the beginning, and so on.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We ended up the way we ended up. We are now organizing both Makeit and Jack, and we are taking care of Sebinsko.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Can you give us a bit of an update on what else you are doing besides this?

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, absolutely. After the conference itself, which ends tomorrow, I have already spoken to the participants.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I feel a bit strange. I have nothing to do in the evening. I don't need to go to emails, answer questions, etc.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Otherwise, I am a daily service in the company Kontron. I lead the development of 5G technology in Slovenia.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is my day job.

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I am a bit divided into several industries. My main industry is construction and real estate.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And of course our company, ESJUG, which is a company for education.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Besides this event, we are also working on other one-day events, and we are also helping to organize a conference.

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Great. Let's start with the official question.

28
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I hope I got the official name of the conference right.

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Makeit, Jackon, Openblend, Slovenia, CEO...

30
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's put it this way. How did we come up with this name?

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
CEO stands for Slovenian Oracle Users Group. This is where we started.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We decided that the name of the conference should have its own brand name.

33
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It shouldn't be the name of the company that organizes the conference.

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is Urbano's merit that we connected with Jackon.

35
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is also a brand name. It all happens under the name Makeit.

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
One part is Oracle-oriented, the ESJUG part, and the other part is Jackon.

37
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Urbano will tell you more about this.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We have been looking for this identity for a while.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We have replaced it with a lot of names.

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Makeit seems to exist now, but Sebinjsko is a bit different.

41
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We have been working on this for a long time.

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
In 2017 we had SEUG and Java SI.

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In 2017 we had both logos on our T-shirts.

44
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It said Makeit.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Someone suggested that we should combine them under one name.

46
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It was Makeit.

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think we combined them in 2018.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then we realized that the problem is how to combine two different fields.

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
One part is Oracle-related, based on DBA and APEX.

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The other part is from another world.

51
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We decided to create a branch here.

52
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We connected with Jackon, a brand.

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We still want this to be one event.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We want it to become two.

55
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What does the brand Jackon mean?

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I will put it this way.

57
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We were very naive.

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I talked to Markos and Richard, who are the main organizers of Jackon Europe and Jackon World.

59
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They said that they would like to expand it to other countries.

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They are still talking about South Africa.

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I said that we would like that.

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We didn't know what to bring.

63
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We said that we would try to keep it for the first year.

64
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If it works, we will keep it.

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If I understand correctly, Jackon also helps you promote the conference between speakers?

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That was the main thing.

68
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Now we have achieved that.

69
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Next year, we plan to do more events.

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Everyone says that there is so much going on here.

71
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It is still an intimate conference.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It is too big.

73
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I would say that we have already lost the romantic side of the conference.

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We forgot to mention Open Bled.

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We forgot to mention Open Bled.

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It is an important event.

77
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, it is important.

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It wasn't easy for Justin.

79
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We have been organizing Open Bled as a Javanese society for many years.

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We have been organizing SCUP and Java SI for many years.

81
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Without Open Bled, Jackon wouldn't exist.

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We are still working on cooperation.

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We are not isolating.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Elisabeta, a question for you.

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you notice that the participants stick to the guidelines?

86
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Or do you notice that people from Jackon go to Oracle and vice versa?

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you notice that this is a trend?

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We have managed to bring the participants closer to the conference.

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We have given them a roof over their heads.

90
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We also have a registration.

91
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Last year we had a deadline.

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Everything is happening now.

93
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There is networking between the participants.

94
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There is a conversation in the evening.

95
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They are preparing to share knowledge and experience.

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They are learning new business opportunities.

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I would like to know how you organize a conference like Makeit.

98
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My first question is when do you start organizing Makeit?

99
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We started the next year before yesterday.

100
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We reserved a space in the hotel.

101
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
First of all, you need to know how much space you need.

102
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Approximately the size of the conference.

103
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How big the conference you want.

104
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How much urban space you need.

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Not too big.

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We have 5 really good halls.

107
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Not more than that.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We had 200 people at the start of the conference.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The maximum was 800.

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This size is beautiful.

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is manageable.

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What needs to be done?

113
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have a sub-question.

114
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I divided it into three parts.

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What are the most important things to do before, after and after the conference?

116
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Maybe I can start.

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We always start too late.

118
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No matter how much we travel, we always run out of time.

119
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can say anything.

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, seriously.

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's start in November.

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We are a bit late.

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We are a bit late.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It was half a year ago.

125
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
More than half a year ago.

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
More than half a year.

127
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We start with the criteria, tracks,

128
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we publish the call for paper,

129
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
then we do the marketing.

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's the main thing.

131
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
A lot of publishers are already reserving.

132
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They have a schedule for next year.

133
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's hard to get a top speaker.

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's one of the key things.

135
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Without a person, it's hard to get people.

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's the first thing.

137
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The choice of location affects the success of the event.

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If I understand correctly, Make It was also in other locations,

139
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
but Porto Rojo is a destination for that.

140
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, the experiences were like this.

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We started in Porto Rojo,

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
then the economic crisis brought us to Ljubljana.

143
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We realized that Ljubljana was not the best choice,

144
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
because people don't take their time,

145
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
they go to meetings, you lose people

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
in the evening events,

147
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
when people can get to know each other.

148
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then, of course, COVID affected us a bit,

149
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
but we were persistent.

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We shared the toilet twice a week,

151
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
so we kept in touch with people.

152
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then we returned to Porto Rojo after COVID.

153
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We will not give up.

154
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I hope that the forces of the world will support us.

155
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You probably come to this question from this location.

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Who is this conference for?

157
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you are a student,

158
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
you probably know

159
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
how far you can go.

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You will probably have a hard time coming to Porto Rojo,

161
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
or it will be harder for you to go to a conference for money.

162
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Or not, maybe I'm wrong.

163
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Maybe this is also a question from that perspective.

164
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is the conference for professionals?

165
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, no.

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I think you profiled yourself well for the job.

168
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We wanted to attract young people,

169
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but Porto Rojo is really poor.

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Everyone is complaining about me.

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How can I not come to Porto Rojo?

172
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sellers, employees,

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
students, absolutely.

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So this conference is intended

175
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
for graduates with a certain amount of experience.

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
They are already a few kilometers away.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There is a barrier.

178
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They have already given up.

179
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If we go back a little bit,

180
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
what should be done in the meantime?

181
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Give me a couple of important wisdoms.

182
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you dealing with today?

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What are the operational things

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that are very important to you at the event?

185
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
At the event?

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yes, yes.

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If I may add,

188
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Porto Rojo, as we said,

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
attracts employees,

190
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
but there is a small difficulty

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in connecting the airport to the airport.

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
At the beginning we said

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that we are trying to attract employees outside of Slovenia,

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
but how to get there?

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It is not up to us,

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
but this is the area where we still have to work.

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If we wanted to have a bigger conference,

198
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
we could start thinking about logistics,

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
how to attract people from other countries.

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes, from other countries.

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What do you do on the day of the conference?

202
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
First of all, make sure that all halls are well-equipped,

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that there is a large number of tables,

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that the best teacher has the largest hall,

205
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that the projectors are working,

206
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
that the adapters are working,

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
that there are a million small pieces,

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
without which the work is not technically possible.

209
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Who we are here is a problem,

210
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
or the challenge is that everything flows correctly,

211
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
only the technology.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
How many people are working on the day of the event?

213
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Five.

214
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then there are students.

215
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We are very proud of our staff,

216
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
because they are all students.

217
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Now all these children and infants have regular services

218
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and are allowed to come and help us for two or three days.

219
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This is a very big challenge,

220
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
but we are very proud of our staff.

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is a very big challenge,

222
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
because people are very busy,

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
especially those who are new.

224
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Teachers are a bit nervous,

225
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
especially those who are new.

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What kind of mouse does not work, what kind of projector does not work,

227
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and then they jump and we fix it.

228
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Great.

229
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Tell me a little more about the selection of teachers.

230
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
When you start to promote the conference,

231
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
do a lot of people apply,

232
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
a few people apply,

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
do you attract them?

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How is the selection going?

235
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Last year we did not have a hard time.

236
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Last year we were very hand-picked.

237
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I went, this is what I want, this is what I want.

238
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It was very subjective,

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
what I wanted to hear at that moment.

240
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Last year,

241
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
it has changed a lot.

242
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It has changed a lot.

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We have a selection.

244
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You will know.

245
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Now I have to pretend I don't know anything.

246
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But yes, please explain.

247
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Two years ago,

248
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I re-selected which

249
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
lectures we would have.

250
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And then I said,

251
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
maybe the participants did not have the same ideas as I do,

252
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and I thought it would be better to have a program selection.

253
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And we put it together

254
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
for Mike and for Jake.

255
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is a great help.

256
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Everyone has their own point of view.

257
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Everyone has their own point of view.

258
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Everyone has their own point of view.

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I will say,

260
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I will do it in a more strict way.

261
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I would like to have more,

262
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
but now we are satisfied with it.

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What helps Oracle

264
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
as an organization?

265
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I will say, a strong sponsor.

266
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, it helps.

267
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oracle supports us,

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
as I said before,

269
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
as a sponsor.

270
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But you cannot get money back from anyone else.

271
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oracle supports this conference with its lectures.

272
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
We cooperate locally and globally.

273
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oracle ACE

274
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
has about 20 of them.

275
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It is their lecture.

276
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
They are well-researched

277
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and well-prepared for the future.

278
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So they support us professionally and technically

279
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
for their lectures and not for sponsorship.

280
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Local marketing services

281
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
do not exist at the moment.

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Our event is not an Oracle event,

283
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but because there are so many people here,

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
we do not do short-term marketing

285
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
as a sales work,

286
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
but as a personal and technical sharing of knowledge.

287
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This is definitely happening.

288
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We do not do marketing sales.

289
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We do not do sales.

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Even the participants do not expect this.

291
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We have other conferences on this topic.

292
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This selection tries to

293
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
make a difference.

294
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
There was an interesting phenomenon this year.

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
There were a lot of applications,

296
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
then we announced the dates,

297
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and a few lecturers withdrew.

298
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There were lecturers who applied more than others,

299
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and then they were selected.

300
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This dynamic is also very interesting.

301
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Maybe something more about this

302
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
are the lectures,

303
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
but also networking, social networking,

304
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and so on.

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Can you tell us why this part is so important

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
for such a conference?

307
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
How important is the non-lecture part?

308
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
First of all, we do not only have a lecture,

309
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
but this year we also added a day before the conference.

310
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This day was yesterday.

311
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It is important that the lectures were hands-on,

312
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that people were deep down in technology,

313
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and that they learned something new,

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
not just heard what would be new.

315
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Networking is important because,

316
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
despite the fact that we all work in our offices,

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the Internet opened up to the world many years ago,

318
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
but everyone got a phone.

319
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Great.

320
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's go to the lecturers.

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We touched on this.

322
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Before we go to the event,

323
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
can you tell me more about how you market such an event?

324
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
How do you think about marketing?

325
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
How do you bring it closer to the audience?

326
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
How do you approach it?

327
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Are there any hacks?

328
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What is a good hack?

329
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That is a difficult question for me.

330
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I am full of techniques.

331
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It is always like that for me.

332
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It is really hard.

333
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The biggest challenge is to have a good base

334
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
where you will send your data.

335
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This base is changing,

336
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
because companies are changing,

337
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
so we try to keep our base as up-to-date as possible.

338
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Of course,

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
we use all additional marketing channels.

340
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I think there is always more,

341
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
but still too little.

342
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We should use LinkedIn more.

343
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Last year we tried Facebook.

344
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Last year we said,

345
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
we are not for Facebook.

346
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We are users, too.

347
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
In the end,

348
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
most of the people here

349
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
really got a phone call.

350
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We call everyone we know.

351
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Have you already made a phone call?

352
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Have you received a notification?

353
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Of course, we send e-mails,

354
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
we use social media.

355
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Thank you for reminding me.

356
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What is the percentage of returnees?

357
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
20, 30, 40, 60?

358
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
80?

359
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
70-80.

360
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
When we opened this world,

361
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
there are always more young people in this field.

362
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But yes, 70-80.

363
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
When you come here,

364
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
it is like a gathering.

365
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Once a year.

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Early bird.

367
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It pays off.

368
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Definitely.

369
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Last year,

370
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
we have been doing this for the last 3 weeks.

371
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I was excited.

372
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I called Justina.

373
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What can we do?

374
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Betty, I told you.

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We have so many halls.

376
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Teachers came, empty halls.

377
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I was excited for the last 3 days.

378
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The last 3 days of early bird.

379
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Until then, you don't know how big the conference will be.

380
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You hope it will be.

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But the last 3 days.

382
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
When we have early bird,

383
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
we have a feeling that we are busy.

384
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We have a lot to do.

385
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We have time for marketing.

386
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
We have to fix something.

387
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We haven't done anything yet.

388
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We have a lot to do.

389
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What do you want to say to early bird fans?

390
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
A lot of things.

391
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
We have to look at it from a political point of view.

392
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Everyone is the same.

393
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If you don't get an approval,

394
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
you send an email, you sign up,

395
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and then we wait for you to get an approval.

396
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
To give someone an early bird,

397
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
we don't do it when it's already closed.

398
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Fair enough.

399
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
A large part of such conferences

400
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
are sponsored by partners.

401
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Could you tell me

402
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
how it works to become a sponsor of a conference like this?

403
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What do you expect in return?

404
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What do you want and what do you get when you become a sponsor of such a conference?

405
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What do you get?

406
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
As a sponsor, we are very open to cooperation.

407
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We have some basic packages,

408
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
but you can also get something else.

409
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Basically, you get your own space,

410
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
you get the opportunity to have your own lecture,

411
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
which, of course, should not be marketed,

412
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
but we have a large number of lectures.

413
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
In the last two years,

414
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the Call for Papers lecture series

415
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
should have been very strict.

416
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Of course, if someone is a sponsor,

417
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
if the lecture is not well-directed,

418
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you can still tell them to correct it,

419
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
so that you can be in the audience,

420
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
because you are a sponsor.

421
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
In the lecture space,

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
you can do whatever you want.

423
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You can play games,

424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
you can drink beer.

425
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
We only have full-length lectures,

426
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
so you can talk to the parties,

427
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
future potential employees.

428
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We must know that such a conference

429
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
has a large number of people.

430
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Then you can participate in all holidays,

431
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
parties, whatever you want.

432
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We always listen and find a package

433
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
to sponsor the sponsors.

434
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It is probably easier to organize

435
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
such an event for some support.

436
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I imagine that you are not entirely dependent

437
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
on the participants.

438
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We are a technical conference,

439
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
so a lot of people come to sell something.

440
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It is a bit more difficult to sell

441
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to another organization,

442
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
such as IDA, etc.

443
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Absolutely, whoever helps us,

444
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I will say that the sponsor

445
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
brings their own lecturer.

446
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Red Hat brought their own lecturer

447
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and a whole group of people.

448
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It is a big thank you for us,

449
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
because they bring the event

450
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
to a new level.

451
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We have top lecturers.

452
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It helps.

453
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I have a question for the audience.

454
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is the conference already so big

455
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
that you have already started

456
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
to receive applications?

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Or not yet?

458
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
No.

459
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
There is still room for growth.

460
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
If there were more participants,

461
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
we would make a jump.

462
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
We would go to another space.

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
We have already seen

464
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
some of the sponsors' applications.

465
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let's talk about the lectures.

466
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
What did you learn

467
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
from the organizers of Make.it?

468
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
How did the conference change?

469
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Are people more willing

470
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
to come to these events?

471
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Is it more difficult for them?

472
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Or is it easier for them?

473
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Can you give me a quick overview?

474
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Is it easier for them?

475
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You can say that it was in 1998.

476
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It was in 1998.

477
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Let's go with that.

478
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What do you think changed?

479
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
There were times when it was easier

480
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
to get participants than now.

481
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The event was focused on

482
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
the fact that the participation

483
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
or sending of participants

484
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
to the conference was a reward.

485
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
There were not many social networks

486
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and the conference was a space

487
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
where everyone met.

488
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Today we all know that we can talk

489
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
in different ways.

490
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I think we are somewhere in the middle.

491
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's not the hardest or the easiest.

492
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I don't think the price is a problem.

493
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's more a matter of time.

494
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You can't send the whole team to the event,

495
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
which means that they will be absent for three days.

496
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That's why we made a map

497
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
so that you can decide in three days

498
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
to try to get as close as possible.

499
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We thought that everyone would go

500
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
to a hybrid conference,

501
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
so that those who couldn't come

502
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
could listen to the recording.

503
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We decided to come here

504
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and learn something new.

505
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Why weren't the lectures recorded?

506
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Did you think about that?

507
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Maybe not in a hybrid way,

508
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
but did you think about it in the past?

509
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
No.

510
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Maybe it's not worth it.

511
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I wouldn't say it's not worth it,

512
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
because when there was Corona,

513
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
everything was online.

514
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
We also shared recordings.

515
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I rarely watch such recordings

516
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
when I go to a conference.

517
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But I do watch technical lectures.

518
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I scroll through what interests me.

519
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We decided to come here

520
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
because we really want to keep it here.

521
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I think it's a good network,

522
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
a good lecture and so on.

523
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What you just said, Urban,

524
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
seems to me that we really have to do that.

525
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We have to do it in the heart of the conference.

526
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The heart of the conference

527
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
is a good program.

528
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We can do whatever we want

529
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
if there is no real personality.

530
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If the lecturers are not renowned,

531
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
then the conference has no real meaning.

532
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
In this personality,

533
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
this is the segment where we have to work.

534
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Maybe this is also related to the question.

535
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
One of the great things we noticed

536
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
is that the participants are invited.

537
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
A survey is being conducted

538
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
between the events.

539
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There is some research going on.

540
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Please tell us more about it,

541
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
because it's very interesting.

542
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The survey is necessary

543
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
to get feedback from the participants.

544
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We want to know if the coffee was warm enough.

545
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We are interested in the personality.

546
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We encourage the participants

547
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
to give some small gifts,

548
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
with a heart at the end,

549
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
where everyone can participate.

550
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We want the survey to be fulfilled.

551
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Then we study all the answers

552
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
in detail and try to understand

553
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
what we have to do better next year.

554
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We haven't received a bad comment yet.

555
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Even if it is a negative comment,

556
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
it is positive for us,

557
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
because it tells us what we have to change,

558
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
what we have to do,

559
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
maybe add some personality.

560
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Coffee is missing every year.

561
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What do you think has changed

562
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
in the survey?

563
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
What is the thing we are starting now?

564
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What is it like in practice?

565
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
In practice,

566
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
you can see where

567
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
the mainstream development is going.

568
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What are the characteristics

569
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
that the participants like to hear?

570
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In the last half of the year,

571
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
we had a lot of hardcore classes.

572
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Java 22, for example.

573
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
There are three questions.

574
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
How good is the personality of a child?

575
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What kind of teacher is he?

576
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't remember the third one.

577
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Organizational part of the conference.

578
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yes.

579
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You can learn a lot from this.

580
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You can see in which direction

581
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
the next year will go.

582
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You never have enough information

583
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
to know what the next year will be like.

584
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You get hints.

585
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It is still hard.

586
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Everyone has some AI.

587
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It is a long time.

588
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You can see that every year

589
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
a buzzword pops up.

590
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Is he in this lecture or not?

591
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It is different.

592
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
If you want to follow everything,

593
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
you are in the right place.

594
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If it is Kubernetes,

595
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
we have a lot of such people.

596
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
APEX gets some mainstream.

597
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
We have more of them.

598
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Let's move on.

599
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I have to do an eBP.

600
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Urban process.

601
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Grodje is possible thanks to our supporters

602
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
on Patreon.

603
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
We thank them for their direct support.

604
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And thanks to Humanfrog, 3FS and Kaldi

605
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
for supporting us.

606
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Thank you.

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Like and subscribe.

608
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I have one more question.

609
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Will summer be cooler?

610
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And what will be cooler?

611
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This is a question from our audience.

612
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It is a question for both of you.

613
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It will be a lot cooler.

614
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You get to know the team you work with.

615
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
If you don't know what to expect,

616
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
what will you do in the final phase,

617
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I will say that I will do very well in the beginning.

618
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I hope so.

619
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I will find out later.

620
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We have a summer break.

621
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I will spend some time and then

622
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
another part of the team will come on stage.

623
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You don't know what to expect.

624
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
In the beginning it was like this.

625
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Who has to do what now?

626
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Now the roles are divided.

627
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You have a salesperson, a technician,

628
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
a website, applications,

629
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
so that the participants can vote.

630
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Everything else...

631
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I know I have to be honest.

632
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You have to know that he has your back.

633
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You are protected.

634
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Whatever becomes easier for you.

635
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It becomes easier to dream at night

636
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
what you forgot to do.

637
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So that the next day you know exactly

638
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
how you will do it, even if you forgot something.

639
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I have to say that I was often asked

640
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
if I do other things,

641
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
because we are such a beautiful team.

642
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Even if something went wrong,

643
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
some of the presenters answered us.

644
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Orban is a cyclist in Portoroš.

645
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
When the presenter said that he can't,

646
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I called him. He was at the top level.

647
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
But we solved it like this.

648
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's easier because the situations are unpredictable

649
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and don't cause as much stress.

650
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You have to trust yourself and the team.

651
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We will fix it.

652
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I would like to add

653
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the last piece of advice.

654
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
If you are a lesbian, this is the last piece of advice.

655
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Whoever hasn't been with us before,

656
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
we won't regret it.

657
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Great. Orban?

658
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I don't know if I have anything else to add.

659
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
If anyone would like to join us,

660
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
we are more than welcome.

661
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We need a new, fresh perspective.

662
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We have been here for a while and we are a bit tired.

663
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
If anyone would like to join us...

664
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Tired of experience.

665
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Let's say it like that.

666
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Elisabeta, Orban, thank you for your time and effort.

667
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
As well as the whole Make It team.

668
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Thank you to the military sponsors

669
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
for making this conference possible.

670
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Thank you for listening to us.

671
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I am looking forward to your feedback.

672
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I wish you all the best.

673
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Thank you.
