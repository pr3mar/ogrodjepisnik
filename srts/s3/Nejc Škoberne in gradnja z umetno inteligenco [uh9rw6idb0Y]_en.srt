DRAGON DAYS CONFERENCE

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Greetings to all the listeners and viewers of Dragon Days.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today we are at the Dragon Days conference.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are gathering here from the events before the event.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
First of all, I would like to thank the patient team

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
for making it possible for us to film here,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
as well as the organizers and the team in Grodno.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then I would like to thank our supporters Humanfrog, 3FS and Kaldi.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I would also like to thank our Patreon,

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
for which we are trying to make some small donations,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but we have to be more forward, let's go.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you too, without you it would be more difficult.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Maybe I will make some noise in the background,

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
because we are at the event and people are moving around.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But we tried to make this event as good as possible.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I would also like to thank some of our friends,

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
who are our guests today.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will be with Oto, and we will have some...

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you, Andraž.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We will have some debates together.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I would also like to thank my parents,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
my teacher.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Moms only on YouTube.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My kids.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Every person is extremely important,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and you have to prepare and optimize for it.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You lose everyone at the beginning.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And what is the best?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Elevator pizza starts with a stand-alone engine.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's it.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We did a lot of background research.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We are like the American SAS,

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
when you sign a contract,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you have to fill out a form,

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and you come to the social security number,

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and you don't have a Slovenian one.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I do.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Great.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You don't have to write a note,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but we pull some details from different boxes.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is a detail that came to my LinkedIn mailbox.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oto, would you like to come to the Fuck Up Nights,

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and tell us about your biggest fuck up?

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Nejc Skobarneja also had a big fuck up,

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
he had a police at home.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I thought it would be interesting,

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and I am sure he will tell us about it,

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and then we will go on.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We will start with you.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can I?

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a long story.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It will be a shorter version.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I have a friend,

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
who is very interested in social priorities.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When I was a student,

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
we had a server together.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We had a hosting on the web.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
One day he came and asked,

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
where should we make a Tor point?

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The idea was to make a middle node,

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and at some point he said,

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
let's make a micro exit node.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
OK, Slava is from Pugumni,

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
for activism and everything.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
His main sell point at the time was,

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you know how many Chinese people,

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
who don't have access to Wikipedia,

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and I thought,

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
it's true.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So we made a Tor point,

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think it was 2.8 or 2.9,

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
purely from humanistic reasons,

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and we donated our computers for that purpose,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and bandwidth.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This thing started to grow so fast,

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that websites started to work with us.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We had a couple of colleagues,

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
who paid for it,

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and we had our own website,

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
we had a server.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It started to work,

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and at some point,

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
in three weeks,

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
we said, let's do it.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And we did.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Two weeks later,

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
a criminal police came to my house,

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
at noon,

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
two policemen,

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and they came to talk to us.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The story is,

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
that there was a search,

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
because of some emails,

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that were sent from my server.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This hosting,

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that we were listening to,

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
was in my home dictionary.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That was the first thing,

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that we went to look at.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I explained to them,

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that we are making a Tor point,

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and they asked,

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
what is it?

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was a bit of an explanation,

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
what it is, and how it works.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We didn't have any logos,

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because the thing was designed

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to have no logos.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They accepted my explanation,

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and that was it.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The woman was very unhappy.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
She didn't know,

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
where we were going.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
She didn't know,

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
where we were going.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was a criminal case,

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and it wasn't a big deal.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
At that time,

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
they told me to calm down,

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and I didn't panic.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Anyway,

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I speak Chinese,

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and that's it.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Three years later,

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know if you remember,

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
there was a meeting in Ljubljana,

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
at 6 a.m.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Mr. Magajn,

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
former MP,

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think he was also a media person,

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
there was another meeting,

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and I was there as well.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was at 6 a.m.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My wife was very upset

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
with my second son.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The first thing they told me,

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
was that they were very lucky

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that they didn't break the door,

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
but they saw how careful I was,

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and they said,

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
maybe not yet.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So, they came to me normally,

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
but I showed them

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the order to search the house,

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and they started to look

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
where the computers were.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was very shocked at that time,

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because I had long forgotten

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
about this case.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, they called me,

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and they asked me to pay

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
for the child pornography,

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and for my wife as well.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It was really unpleasant,

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and then I realized,

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
as soon as they showed me the IP address,

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I understood.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So, in those three weeks,

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
they only found

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
these things

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
in the office.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I would have connected them,

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
but I didn't.

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So, I went to explain

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
to them one more time,

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and there were some interesting

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
details,

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
in the sense that

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mr. Kriminalist said

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
that everything would be fine,

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and that I would go to the computer,

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and he would call someone

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
on the phone,

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and he would give me

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
what I had to type in,

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and we would see

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
if it was the old computer

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
with the IP address.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And then I said,

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
no, no, no, that IP address

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
is there, next to the phone,

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it has nothing to do with my

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
apartment, nothing.

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We have to go there,

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
if you want to see it.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And he said, no, no,

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have to go there,

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
because I have the right here,

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
open the computer,

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I have the IP address,

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
if you want to see it,

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
let's go inside.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I was just doing

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
what I had to do.

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then,

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
he said,

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
thank you for explaining it to me,

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and I believe you,

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
but let's go to the computer,

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I will take you to the police station,

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
where you will go with me,

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and you will explain it to me

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
once more,

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and then we will see

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
what will happen.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And it really happened,

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I explained it to him once more,

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then he said,

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
ok, I will take you to the police station,

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and then they decided.

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I was like,

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
ok, I hope it will be ok.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And then I told him

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
who we were,

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and so on.

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And that was it.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It would be strange

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
if you were like,

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
sorry,

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
it's just the beginning.

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So,

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
you would be like,

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
everyone starts like that.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's a story.

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And then,

226
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
when I came back,

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
he said,

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
criminalist,

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
how would we know

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
what you are,

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
what kind of computer you have.

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And that was it.

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's talk about

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
the future of Thor,

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
which is a computer

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that is running

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
a protocol

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
called Thor.

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This protocol

240
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
wraps the packets,

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
it's also called

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
the Onion Router,

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
when the packets

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that are transmitted

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
between the nodes

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
are wrapped

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
in additional headers

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
in such a mathematically

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
interesting way

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
that you can follow

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
where the packet went in

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and where it went out.

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can't see the whole path,

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
which means

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it's anonymous.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The sender of the packet

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
is anonymous.

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is possible

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
if you don't have

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
a large part of the network

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
under surveillance.

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If you have it,

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you can see these things.

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's say

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the whole delegation,

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I think I said this last time,

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
is one of the biggest donors

268
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
of nodes for Thor.

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So they have their own

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
exit nodes,

271
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the way you described it,

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and they watch what goes out.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think so,

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
but also for their own needs.

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I said this before,

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
but also for their own,

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because it's so big

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that it actually works well.

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who has how much

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
under surveillance,

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know.

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's it.

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The best.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think we liked that hook.

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I hope we got

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the audience's attention,

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
because now

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
in all this

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
mess of information,

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm honestly,

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
when we prepared

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
with Andraž,

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
we did something

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
like a roadmap,

295
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
where you started,

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and then we also had

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
a full AI.

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They also want to talk

299
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
about AI,

300
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
because you now have a company

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
around it,

302
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
but I prepared it,

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
notes,

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and yesterday

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
everything changed again.

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
In AI?

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In AI.

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
From evening to evening

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
we talked about

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
what it looks like

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
when you create

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
your third company,

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
your third startup,

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and you decided

315
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
to make a new product,

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and AI is at the heart

317
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
of your solution.

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How do you work

319
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
in this space?

320
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How do you prepare?

321
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is it stressful for you

322
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
when some changes happen?

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No.

324
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
For me,

325
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it was the most stressful

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
after Lani

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
came out of API

328
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
to GGBT,

329
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and we were still

330
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
very firmly

331
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
in the previous company,

332
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
firmly in the sense

333
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that we are executing a vision

334
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and we want to do

335
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
as much as possible.

336
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And then API came to stop

337
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and I intuitively felt

338
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that it is a big deal.

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It opens up

340
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
a lot of new opportunities

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
that are potentially

342
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
much more valuable

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
than my previous company

344
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
still works.

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And there was this stress

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
of this commitment,

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and how

348
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to pivot this,

349
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the idea that we don't

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
have to pivot these companies

351
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to an AI company,

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
but how to convince

353
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the co-founders

354
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to do something new,

355
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
what to do with this business,

356
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and so on.

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
How to use

358
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
this opportunity.

359
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Otherwise,

360
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I trust Twitter a lot,

361
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and I think

362
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
it is a trip around the world

363
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
where I feel

364
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
what is happening

365
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and it generates

366
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
some ideas.

367
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And now,

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
will you?

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes, I am interested.

370
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We got

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
API to these LLM models,

372
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
but

373
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
things are changing.

374
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
New models are coming,

375
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
some are potentially more valuable,

376
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and I am interested

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that you can't rely on one

378
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
because we don't know

379
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
what is going to happen

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
in a month,

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
four years,

382
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
or half a year.

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And if you have an idea,

384
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
when you don't know

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
what to do,

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and then you write

387
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
some tests for evaluation

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
of new models,

389
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
how does it look?

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I mean,

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you don't have time

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
to evaluate it manually,

393
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or you decide

394
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
on your own.

395
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
At the moment,

396
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
there are three of us

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
in this new company,

398
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
as founders,

399
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
so we don't have

400
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
much time

401
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
to deal with

402
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
systematization,

403
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
evaluation,

404
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
cross-model,

405
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
etc.

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So now it was more

407
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
like,

408
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
hey,

409
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
let's do some experiments,

410
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
let's work, let's work.

411
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But that didn't work out.

412
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean,

413
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
what is the biggest

414
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
risk?

415
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think the biggest problem

416
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
in the development of

417
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
production systems

418
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
is how to minimize

419
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the regression.

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You don't have a model

421
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
at the level of a model,

422
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but at the level of a prompt.

423
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
How can you,

424
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
even if you think

425
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
that it's a bad idea,

426
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
how can you minimize

427
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the regression?

428
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I mean,

429
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
we didn't overdo it,

430
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
or we did it by default,

431
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but now it doesn't work anymore.

432
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
How can you minimize it?

433
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And this is really

434
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
not a clear answer

435
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
to the industry

436
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
as I perceive it.

437
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What we are doing now

438
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
is that you have

439
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
an evaluation framework

440
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
where you have some data.

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Now, for example,

442
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
we have so many

443
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
generated

444
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
prompts,

445
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
so many stories,

446
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
that we can put a table

447
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and label it.

448
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's all OK.

449
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Now we put another model,

450
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
what is happening,

451
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
where are the differences,

452
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
where are the differences.

453
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But it's enough

454
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
to have all these

455
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
nuances.

456
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But our use case

457
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
is not critical.

458
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We write everything by e-mail.

459
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If something is written

460
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
by e-mail,

461
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you can still

462
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
look at the end

463
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and correct it.

464
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They are not kitchen recipes

465
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
when you have to mix

466
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
two eggs.

467
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
First of all,

468
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
people probably know

469
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the story of Genialis,

470
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
which is

471
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
one of the biggest

472
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
biotech startups

473
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
in Slovenia.

474
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We probably have more,

475
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
but on my radar

476
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
we already had Roman

477
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
from Genialis.

478
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Then the meeting

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
with Bio is

480
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
another story.

481
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Celestia is the third.

482
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I noticed

483
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
when I was looking

484
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
at the products

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and what you wrote,

486
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that

487
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
sales

488
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
is a mission.

489
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I feel like you want

490
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to deal with sales

491
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and help people.

492
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Is that a topic

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
throughout all this?

494
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I've never talked about it.

495
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What is my

496
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
bottom line?

497
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's the beginning of a big thing.

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's what I see

499
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
as my mission.

500
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
To be honest,

501
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
if you want to do it

502
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
on an important scale,

503
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
it's much easier

504
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
if you have

505
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
financial resources.

506
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's why

507
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
when I started

508
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
my first company,

509
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I wanted to be a product company,

510
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
not just an operating company

511
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
where I would sell my products

512
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and create a good service.

513
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I wanted to create a business

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that I could sell

515
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and get some resources

516
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
with which I could make

517
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
some changes in the world

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that made sense to me.

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Legally.

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Legally, yes.

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's my motivation.

522
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Why am I trying to

523
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
create big companies?

524
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a great

525
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
financial independence

526
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
that I've built there

527
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and I could do it

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
for another 300 hours.

529
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But I'm not interested in that.

530
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm interested in building

531
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
as big as possible

532
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
so that I can

533
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
start even bigger.

534
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
One big thing I'd like to do

535
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
in Slovenia

536
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
is a really good

537
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
vocational high school.

538
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We have a lot of

539
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
young people

540
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
who have nothing to do

541
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
with what I experience

542
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
as a business.

543
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think that

544
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
young people are great

545
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
entry point for a business

546
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
because they have

547
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
a lot of naivety.

548
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
One of the key

549
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
characteristics of mine

550
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is that I'm very naive.

551
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If you ask my father

552
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
he would say

553
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that I'm too naive.

554
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's what he said

555
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
at the beginning.

556
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Why?

557
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He wanted

558
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that Slovenia

559
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
would be economically

560
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
more powerful,

561
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
with more value,

562
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
more business,

563
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
more life.

564
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's the bottom line.

565
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Personally,

566
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
everything was opportunistic.

567
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I was in security,

568
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
IT,

569
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
for 10 years.

570
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Then my colleague came

571
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and said

572
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
let's make a company

573
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that has nothing to do with it.

574
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
At the time,

575
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
we thought

576
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
it would be an orange

577
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
in the cloud,

578
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
a data analytics platform.

579
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It turned out

580
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that

581
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
we had

582
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the same tool

583
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
for video production

584
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
as for IT.

585
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We had almost everything.

586
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Why would you be naive?

587
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Then we said

588
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
let's focus

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
on bioinformatics

590
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
because it's

591
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
a huge space.

592
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In bioinformatics

593
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
we started

594
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
because

595
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
you were

596
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
our

597
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
founding advisor

598
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and at the time

599
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
he was working

600
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
in a different field.

601
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He asked

602
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
what if we tried

603
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
to commercialize

604
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and productivize it.

605
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The company was like that.

606
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I had no idea

607
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
about biology and bioinformatics.

608
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It was one of the

609
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
worst decisions

610
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I've made in 10 years.

611
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I knew them very well

612
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and I started to learn

613
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
things I had no idea about.

614
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I had no idea about

615
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
construction teams.

616
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I didn't know that

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
so I focused

618
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
on things

619
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
that were

620
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
easier to learn

621
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
in sales and marketing

622
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
than in bioinformatics.

623
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That was the reason

624
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
why I got into sales.

625
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I found sales

626
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
interesting

627
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
because

628
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
it's exciting

629
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
because you do something

630
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and then you go out

631
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and you have no idea

632
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
how the world will react

633
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and you watch the reaction.

634
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That reaction brings me

635
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
a lot of excitement

636
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and that's why

637
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
it's a huge opportunity.

638
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Our listeners

639
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
have a feeling

640
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that it's very technical

641
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
even though the podcast

642
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
is quite technical.

643
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I think that

644
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Marzlo is thinking

645
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
that maybe

646
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I should make a product

647
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
that's lifestyle,

648
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
business,

649
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
whatever.

650
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I think that

651
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
a lot of us

652
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
struggle with

653
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
sales.

654
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Can you give us

655
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
some advice

656
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
on how to learn

657
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
or just try?

658
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think you have

659
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the best insights.

660
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
First of all,

661
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
marketing is something

662
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
that's harder to learn

663
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
than sales.

664
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
In marketing,

665
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
writing,

666
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,920
some marketing messages,

667
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,240
and then enjoying yourself in that person inside,

668
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,000
who must be a real millionaire, an audience, etc.

669
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,120
Sales is a real thing,

670
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,719
you do something,

671
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:22,440
and because you are so excited that it exists now and that it helps someone,

672
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,480
you find someone who you think will be that person,

673
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,360
and you tell him with all your heart,

674
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
and you ask him,

675
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,119
is that really something that would make his life easier?

676
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,000
But you don't need any marketing messages,

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,840
and I think that...

678
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,560
I think it is very important that you are

679
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,560
normally friendly, not a fool, but also that you are not...

680
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,279
Grumpy.

681
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,799
Yes, grumpy,

682
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,320
and that you are an optimist.

683
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,599
Because if you are a pessimist, and it doesn't work out,

684
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:06,720
then it's hard to inspire other people, because you have to inspire them.

685
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,480
So I think that if you are like that, and if you don't have a formal understanding of sales,

686
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,320
it's great.

687
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,959
So sales is a bit more organic, and marketing is...

688
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:23,000
It seems to me, as a computer scientist,

689
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,680
that I have always experienced myself exclusively as a computer scientist

690
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,879
until 2012, when a colleague asked me if I wanted to start a company.

691
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:38,559
My elders are businessmen, and when they asked me if I wanted to start a company,

692
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,120
I said no, I am a computer scientist, I am a programmer, that's it.

693
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,559
And it was the first time that I had that relationship for a long time,

694
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,400
without any connections.

695
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,839
Until now, my ambitiousness to have a company overruled me.

696
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,480
And it was like, ok, now I see, if I want to have a business, I have to start selling.

697
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,320
And then you do what you can do, and then...

698
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,600
Do you think that...

699
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
On the other hand, there is this argument,

700
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,320
a lot of developers, and I have experienced it,

701
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,759
if I went into sales, if I sold a lot of things, and then into marketing,

702
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:26,360
then I wouldn't have time for development, I wouldn't be a developer anymore.

703
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,679
Do you think that this is a skill that every developer has to master, or is it one or the other?

704
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,639
Is it excluded, or is it an upgrade, a skill that every developer has to master?

705
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:39,039
I don't think so.

706
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,600
No, I know a lot of good engineers, who are super happy, good engineers,

707
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,919
and honestly, if you don't have the ambition

708
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:54,440
to be a CEO, or a more non-strict technical co-founder of a company,

709
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,520
then there is no reason.

710
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Even if you are a technical co-founder,

711
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,320
if you have a good team, then you don't have to sell.

712
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:10,119
If you work with an enterprise, then you will be part of the team that you will have to be there.

713
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,119
Otherwise, I don't think so.

714
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,919
So I don't think it's unnecessary.

715
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:24,360
It's true that here, for example, you have an engineer who is a bit shy.

716
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,399
I mean, when you come to it,

717
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,240
OK, I will work as a freelancer, I will not work as a freelancer.

718
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,199
OK, and then you come, OK, now I have to get a job.

719
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:41,720
Of course, in engineering, in software, it's not a problem,

720
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,520
but you have one job, and you work with it, and you are a freelancer.

721
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,520
For example, if you work in an agency,

722
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,520
and if you want to sell, you want to have more customers,

723
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,520
then you quickly realize that it takes a lot of time.

724
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
So, yes.

725
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Maybe a good comment on freelancing is that

726
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,520
people don't get disappointed when they go,

727
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,520
OK, I work in a big system, I'm a junior,

728
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,520
so I would probably go from a junior position to a senior position,

729
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,519
or I grew up in a company,

730
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,519
now I will go to SP, and I will be a freelancer,

731
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,519
and I will try other things.

732
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,519
People don't get disappointed,

733
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,519
and this decision also means that now you are an entrepreneur.

734
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,519
That's right.

735
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,519
An entrepreneur means that you have taken on a lot of responsibilities.

736
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,519
Maybe you don't get disappointed yet,

737
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,519
but now you are alone in the market.

738
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,519
I see a lot of people asking,

739
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,519
how much do I have to pay now?

740
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,519
How much do I have to pay to go to SP,

741
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,519
so that I will be at the same level as I was when I was a kid?

742
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,519
There are a lot of things that you can't calculate at all.

743
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,519
Are you going to go in that direction?

744
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,519
Yes, I'm just trying.

745
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,519
If you say,

746
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,519
ah, I will, I don't know,

747
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,519
this year,

748
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,519
let's say you are working on some projects,

749
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,519
and they are two-month projects,

750
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,519
that means you will have, I don't know, 6 pages in total.

751
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,519
If they are shorter, you can also have 12 pages.

752
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,519
You have a constantly cold deadline,

753
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,519
cost of doing business,

754
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,519
you go to meetings,

755
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,519
and you lose so much time,

756
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,519
and then you realize,

757
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,519
ah, ok, if I work for a Slovenian market,

758
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,519
and if I work for a Slovenian market,

759
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,519
how much does my hourly wage have to be now?

760
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,519
And then you have,

761
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,519
ok, in Slovenia you have some specifics,

762
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,519
and then it's quite difficult to sell an hour,

763
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,519
because no one really knows the cost.

764
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,519
However,

765
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,519
if you take some extra risks,

766
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,519
for hospitalization,

767
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,519
and you also want to get a bonus,

768
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,519
I think that, I don't know,

769
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,519
in our country, for example,

770
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,519
people often don't realize

771
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,519
that if you are an entrepreneur,

772
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,519
it's good to get a bonus,

773
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,519
no matter what it means.

774
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,519
Whether it's a financial incentive,

775
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,519
or whatever it is.

776
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,519
I often see things like that.

777
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,519
I would say that

778
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,519
in software,

779
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,519
this problem is less acute,

780
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,519
because in reality,

781
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,519
it's much more complicated

782
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,519
than it seems.

783
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,519
I mean, good engineers

784
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,519
always have to decide,

785
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,519
but if you are a designer,

786
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,519
it's a really difficult problem.

787
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,519
To be a freelancer,

788
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,519
and then get websites

789
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,519
that are so recurring,

790
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,519
and you have to cover it all year long.

791
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,519
Yes, yes.

792
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,519
We don't have to work on the marketing pipeline,

793
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,519
and write sales,

794
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,519
because we have customers in one phase.

795
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,519
When you mentioned writing,

796
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,519
I'll get to that now.

797
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,519
Now, I hope that

798
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,519
some of our audience

799
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,519
is paying attention.

800
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,519
Recently, we've seen

801
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,519
a couple of blog posts.

802
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,519
Andraž also saw some videos

803
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,519
where you

804
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,519
wrote that you're looking

805
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,519
for a new co-founder.

806
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,519
I think I've seen two posts

807
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,519
for different use cases.

808
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,519
Those were probably posts

809
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,519
that were totally against job ads,

810
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,519
but now I'm going to

811
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,519
explain one of them,

812
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,519
and then I'll mention the others.

813
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,519
You wrote that

814
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,519
you're looking for a co-founder,

815
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,519
a technical co-founder,

816
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,519
and then you wrote

817
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,519
what you do,

818
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,519
in great detail.

819
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,519
You wrote about the financial results

820
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,519
of your work,

821
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,519
how much you earn,

822
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,519
and you also wrote

823
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,519
what kind of job it is.

824
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,519
I think it was

825
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,519
5000 EUR gross,

826
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,519
15% of the company,

827
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,519
4 years period,

828
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,519
and 6 months cliff.

829
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,519
It's like fresh air

830
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,519
in this space.

831
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,519
That's the first part of the email.

832
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,519
Then you explain in great detail

833
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,519
who you are, what you've done,

834
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,519
who you'll work with,

835
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,519
what you want to do.

836
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,519
I'm also curious,

837
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,519
did you get any feedback

838
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,519
because of that?

839
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,519
Why did you do it?

840
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,519
Did you want job ads to look like that?

841
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,520
No, I did it because

842
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I did it because

843
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I had a great experience

844
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
when I wrote

845
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
only one post on

846
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Slavic Developers

847
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
in two posts

848
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
to look for a co-founder.

849
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Six months before that,

850
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
it wasn't practical for me.

851
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
We had four posts,

852
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
so it wasn't a good fit.

853
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
I learned that

854
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
if you want to

855
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
get results

856
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
in the end,

857
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
you need statistical power

858
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
in sales and hiring.

859
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Hiring is just a reverse of sales.

860
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
I started thinking

861
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
how to get volume,

862
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
how to get

863
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
more attention

864
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
and more eyeballs

865
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
only because of Slavic words.

866
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
I started thinking

867
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
what I would call myself.

868
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
In fact, if someone

869
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
wrote my whole story

870
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
and I don't have a hard time

871
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
with transparency,

872
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
I always have a feeling

873
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
that I don't have anything to lose.

874
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Maybe because I've never

875
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
written anything,

876
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
but I haven't had a hard time

877
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
with transparency.

878
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
It's a big difference

879
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
how to make a pipeline

880
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
of candidates.

881
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
We got 30 posts

882
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
from which we had

883
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
three really good candidates.

884
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
We were able to choose

885
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
which one was good.

886
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,520
I've seen that blog post

887
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,520
in four days

888
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
with 7,000 people,

889
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
so it's a good number.

890
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
It's true,

891
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
but the thing is

892
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
that it works

893
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
for full senior positions.

894
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
It doesn't work well

895
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
if it's only

896
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
a regular engineer.

897
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Why do you think that?

898
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Because they don't understand?

899
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
I don't know why.

900
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I've tried twice

901
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
for different positions

902
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
and it didn't work.

903
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
When we were looking for

904
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
a chief AI officer,

905
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
we got a lot of rejections.

906
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Maybe because

907
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
there was a specific set

908
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
of requirements.

909
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
One of them is

910
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
that in the last 12 months

911
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
you have to work on

912
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
production systems.

913
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
Not many people deal with it.

914
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
We got a lot of rejections,

915
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
but twice before

916
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
I've tried the same post

917
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
and it didn't work.

918
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
But it was for less senior positions.

919
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
But it worked.

920
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
We'll put a link

921
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
on the screen

922
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
where you can watch

923
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
all the episodes.

924
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
People contacted you

925
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,520
and they said

926
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
your voice is interesting

927
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
but the pay is too high.

928
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Can it be lower?

929
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
No.

930
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
There were no rejections.

931
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
I've put it on LinkedIn.

932
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
People got engaged

933
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
and responded.

934
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
No one commented

935
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
that the compensation package

936
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
is too low.

937
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Because

938
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
in the round

939
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
when we offered

940
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
a lower pay for

941
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
a senior engineer

942
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
but a lot of

943
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
equity components,

944
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,520
it's hard for someone

945
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
to say

946
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
that it's too low.

947
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Unless they're interested in

948
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
the cash component.

949
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
There was a comment

950
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
on LinkedIn.

951
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
But 60% of companies said

952
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
that it's OK.

953
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
One thing

954
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
we noticed

955
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
is that people are

956
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
building public.

957
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
It's very transparent.

958
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
For me,

959
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
these two posts

960
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
are very good.

961
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
It's a Facebook group.

962
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
OK, it wasn't for me.

963
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,520
But I'll write

964
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
that it's really good.

965
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I think it's very sincere.

966
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
We have a few other companies

967
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,520
in Slovenia

968
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
that have pay calculators

969
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
and live in Slovenia

970
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
and multiply with the index

971
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
and get paid.

972
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
We have a company like that.

973
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,520
But yeah,

974
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
I wasn't really aware

975
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
if there are

976
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
any other things

977
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
that you shared

978
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,520
such as transparency,

979
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
advantages...

980
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
When we started

981
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Genialis,

982
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
we talked about

983
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
100% internal transparency.

984
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
In the sense that

985
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
we had all the pay

986
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
internally open

987
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
and we were able to prevent it.

988
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,520
We also had a system like that.

989
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,520
If you have an internal

990
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
transparent compensation,

991
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
you need a different system

992
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
because you can't talk about anything.

993
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
That turned out

994
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
to be a substitute.

995
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Transparency,

996
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
although in all other

997
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
numbers,

998
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,520
is not a problem.

999
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
But it doesn't pay.

1000
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Why?

1001
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Because it simply

1002
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
doesn't work.

1003
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
In the sense that

1004
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
we are not mature enough,

1005
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
including me,

1006
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
to be able to...

1007
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
We have a lot of examples

1008
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
with each other

1009
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
and then you have to

1010
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
think about it all the time.

1011
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
I've done it so much

1012
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
that I'm totally

1013
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
torn apart.

1014
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
It's dangerous

1015
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
to deal with it all the time.

1016
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Plus,

1017
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
it's even more dangerous

1018
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
that you can't hire a person

1019
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
if you really want to.

1020
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,520
Because,

1021
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,520
yeah, there's a system

1022
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
and someone is really good

1023
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,520
but the system is broken

1024
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
and you want to fix it

1025
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
but you can't because

1026
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
if you don't,

1027
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
you can't fix it.

1028
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,520
That's the only thing

1029
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
that doesn't work.

1030
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
For example,

1031
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
you are Bosnian

1032
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
and we told you

1033
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,520
that we have such a system

1034
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
and you said,

1035
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
no, no,

1036
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
it's really hard

1037
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
to scale it.

1038
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Buffer is a company

1039
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
that went through 100 people

1040
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,520
and had a totally

1041
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
transparent system

1042
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
and it looked like it all worked

1043
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
on Zoom.

1044
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
He knew the company

1045
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
and he said, no, it doesn't work.

1046
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
What did he tell me?

1047
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,520
There will come a time

1048
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
when you hire a salesman

1049
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
and you will have to pay him

1050
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
a lot of money

1051
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
and a high commission.

1052
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
This person will have to

1053
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
be able to earn

1054
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
half a million,

1055
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
a million years.

1056
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,520
Your engineer will earn 200 euros

1057
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
and if he sees your sales

1058
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
he will pay you a million.

1059
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
That won't be good.

1060
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
You can't just be an engineer

1061
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
and go sell.

1062
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
If he earns 8 euros more,

1063
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,520
he earns 8 euros more.

1064
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
What did he earn?

1065
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
In the end, it's just transportation.

1066
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Transparency is never

1067
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
a negative thing.

1068
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Let's talk about

1069
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
AI.

1070
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Before you came to

1071
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
Nine, you had a mission

1072
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,520
on Dragon Days

1073
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
and you were the host.

1074
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
What is

1075
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
the most

1076
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
interesting

1077
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
aspect

1078
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
of AI

1079
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
in your field?

1080
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
What excites you?

1081
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
What is the most interesting to you?

1082
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Which field

1083
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
do you like the most?

1084
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Shit, this is amazing.

1085
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
General intelligence.

1086
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Again,

1087
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
I see here

1088
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
that you have an optimistic

1089
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
and pessimistic camp.

1090
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
We are optimists

1091
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
at the beginning of

1092
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
exponential curve.

1093
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Optimists in the sense

1094
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
that we are at the beginning of development.

1095
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
It's not necessary

1096
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
that everything will be good in the future.

1097
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
This is a very important topic.

1098
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Pessimists do it very quickly.

1099
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
They say,

1100
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
everything is fine,

1101
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
but we are already at the plateau

1102
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
and there will be nothing left.

1103
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
I believe that we are

1104
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
very fast against

1105
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
general intelligence

1106
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
at the human level.

1107
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
And, in my opinion,

1108
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
much faster than humans.

1109
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Now,

1110
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
this is totally

1111
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
exciting to me.

1112
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
If you could

1113
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,520
do something smart

1114
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
to reduce

1115
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
the use of time for

1116
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
unrelated tasks in life,

1117
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
what would it be?

1118
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,520
As a developer, as an engineer,

1119
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
on the one hand, you use

1120
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,520
cutting edge

1121
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,520
as much as you can,

1122
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,520
or cutting edge models

1123
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,520
that you can get for your use case

1124
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,520
and test them.

1125
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,520
But,

1126
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
how do we get

1127
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
to the next level?

1128
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
We will probably

1129
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
release this episode

1130
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,520
before the jump.

1131
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,520
Now we have

1132
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
Co-Pilot,

1133
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,520
Cursor,

1134
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
where all the ideas are integrated together.

1135
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,520
In a way, you use

1136
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,520
this technology for a short time,

1137
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,520
and probably

1138
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
before or after this technology,

1139
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
the rest of your job

1140
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
will be complete,

1141
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,520
or not, or maybe not.

1142
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
How do you deal with this?

1143
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,520
Because I notice that

1144
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
I ask myself

1145
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
what I build

1146
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
out of what I do.

1147
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
Where do I add

1148
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
value as a developer?

1149
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,520
If I write

1150
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
some stupid scripts

1151
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
and now generate them,

1152
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
probably this is not the best use of my time.

1153
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,520
I also have to evaluate

1154
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
as a developer, as an engineer.

1155
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,520
How do you deal with this?

1156
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
I am a slab programmer,

1157
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
and for slab programmers,

1158
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,520
for us slab programmers,

1159
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,520
this tool is really good.

1160
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
Because you can create a cursor

1161
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,520
that has this interactive mode,

1162
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,520
where you can

1163
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
put whatever you want,

1164
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
and the whole project is written

1165
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
with all the files.

1166
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
It's really impressive.

1167
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,520
I can't wait to try

1168
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
because I haven't tried it yet.

1169
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,520
I really think

1170
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
that it will go in this direction.

1171
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,520
Even if one of my sons

1172
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,520
would ask me

1173
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
if it would be good to go into entrepreneurship,

1174
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,520
I would probably say no.

1175
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
I mean,

1176
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
I wouldn't advise him to do it.

1177
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
You have to work in the physical world,

1178
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,520
and here you can still do it.

1179
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
You need a plate for that, right?

1180
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,520
Yes, anything in the physical world,

1181
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
but not in the information world.

1182
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,520
I have a strong feeling

1183
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,520
that the whole mental

1184
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,520
and information world

1185
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
will come to me.

1186
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,520
Artificial intelligence

1187
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
in the sense of

1188
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,520
productivity.

1189
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
If you are an artist,

1190
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
that's something else.

1191
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
But in the sense of productivity,

1192
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,520
we don't have a chance.

1193
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,520
I mean,

1194
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,520
programmers,

1195
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,520
that's a pretty solid

1196
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,520
title.

1197
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
So,

1198
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,520
for me,

1199
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,520
it's exciting.

1200
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,520
I'm really

1201
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,520
looking forward to it.

1202
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,520
I'm really looking forward to it.

1203
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Even in that sense,

1204
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
I started to think about it practically.

1205
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,520
The question is

1206
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
when will we reach the threshold

1207
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
where I won't have to

1208
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
focus too much on

1209
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,520
employing new engineers,

1210
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,520
but more on

1211
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,520
what I want to do,

1212
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,520
which will be faster,

1213
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,520
more expensive, and so on.

1214
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,520
I don't think we are that far yet.

1215
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,520
We will only write

1216
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
jira tickets, and then

1217
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,520
people will say,

1218
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,520
I watched the interview.

1219
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,520
I thought a little

1220
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
about that,

1221
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,520
and you can correct me later,

1222
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,520
but when Facebook came out,

1223
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,520
it was a big deal,

1224
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
people will know

1225
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,520
how old I am when I enter Facebook.

1226
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,520
But when Facebook came out,

1227
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,520
it was a revolution,

1228
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,520
a big deal, when Facebook

1229
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,520
released its graph apps,

1230
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
which enabled

1231
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,520
foreign developers

1232
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
to work with Facebook's data

1233
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,520
and their apps,

1234
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,520
apps that

1235
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,520
worked within

1236
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,520
the system.

1237
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
A platform was created,

1238
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,520
and people developed their own apps

1239
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,520
within the system.

1240
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,520
Well, it's 2024,

1241
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
we still have some

1242
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,520
information security,

1243
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,520
data, etc.

1244
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,520
But again, it was a platform,

1245
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,520
and within the platform you could

1246
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,520
create apps. Until a certain point

1247
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,520
it worked, but it was a platform

1248
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
where you could create things.

1249
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
If we look at Playstation,

1250
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,520
we work on its apps.

1251
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
iOS,

1252
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
which Apple released,

1253
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
AppMarket, again you could

1254
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
create apps for that platform.

1255
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
And a lot of times

1256
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,520
it happened that

1257
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,520
a startup created

1258
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,520
a product within those ecosystems.

1259
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Maybe at the beginning

1260
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,520
they were full top-sheet products,

1261
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
but then those platform owners

1262
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
said, hey,

1263
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,520
what if we created our own?

1264
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
And they developed their own products

1265
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,520
within their own ecosystem.

1266
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
They had an advantage anyway,

1267
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
because they knew the ecosystem better.

1268
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,520
And here it seems to me

1269
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,520
that with such products

1270
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,520
you have to ask yourself,

1271
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,520
do I really have something

1272
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,520
that those who created GPT

1273
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
don't have to create themselves?

1274
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Do I have to think of it as

1275
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,520
a technology that I just

1276
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,520
install within the product?

1277
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,520
Or do I have to think of it as

1278
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,520
something that they can eat?

1279
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,520
I don't know, it's just something

1280
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,520
that you have to think about.

1281
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,520
I think that it's very difficult

1282
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,520
to be in a foundational model of business

1283
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,520
like Anthropic OpenAI and

1284
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,520
short application layer business.

1285
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,520
It's practically impossible.

1286
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,520
If you're going to work on models

1287
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,520
within that foundational model

1288
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,520
and you're going to be good at it

1289
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,520
for a while, until it's

1290
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
totally commoditized with open source

1291
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
and so on, I don't believe

1292
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
that it's going to be an algorithmic

1293
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
edge, and in the end

1294
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,520
open source will prevail.

1295
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
But if you're working on an

1296
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
application layer, you're going to

1297
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
use foundational models.

1298
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,520
So, for example, if I'm afraid

1299
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,520
for our company,

1300
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,520
it's not OpenAI,

1301
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,520
it's not that, because

1302
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,520
all the other competitors

1303
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,520
that work on similar

1304
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,520
services are using the same

1305
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
foundational models.

1306
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,520
And then the question is,

1307
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,520
why do I have an edge?

1308
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,520
Because basically everyone

1309
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,520
uses the same technology.

1310
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,520
And now, as long as the basic

1311
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,520
models are still alive,

1312
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,520
you can have a full and thick

1313
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,520
wrapper on top of OpenAI.

1314
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The thickness of the wrapper is your differentiation,

1315
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
which is hard to reproduce.

1316
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
As the foundational materials become more and more intelligent,

1317
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
the layer becomes thinner.

1318
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
The reproducibility of your startup is simplified,

1319
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
which is what scares me.

1320
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
With every new OpenAI model,

1321
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
the pipeline that we create,

1322
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
it becomes more and more obsolete.

1323
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It becomes more and more obsolete,

1324
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
because the whole group is working on zero-shot,

1325
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and you always have to use O1 model,

1326
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
which was released yesterday,

1327
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
from OpenAI.

1328
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
They explicitly say, use zero-shot,

1329
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
don't make a bigger sample,

1330
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
because you will damage the accuracy of the model.

1331
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
The data will only go to what is personal,

1332
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
not to everything.

1333
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Very soon we will come to the conclusion

1334
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
that there will always be less pipeline needed,

1335
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
that everything will be done in a simplified way,

1336
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
with context, and you will get a very good response.

1337
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You won't have to crush your business problem

1338
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
on a smaller scale.

1339
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
That's what I think.

1340
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Either other startups will reproduce it,

1341
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
or sales platforms that are bigger,

1342
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
like HubSpot, CRM,

1343
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
with which we integrate.

1344
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Why did they do it themselves?

1345
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
This is an innovator's dilemma.

1346
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't know.

1347
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I don't know.

1348
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I don't know.

1349
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's an innovator's dilemma,

1350
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and culture values.

1351
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You can also get internet in big companies,

1352
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
when they hack it in half a year.

1353
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But it's not a problem in big companies.

1354
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's a very interesting dilemma.

1355
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Why didn't they do it?

1356
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The problem is that they can't.

1357
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You can do it, but you can't release it.

1358
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You can't release a solution that works

1359
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
for 95% of the pages.

1360
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It has to be reliable.

1361
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
If the media comes and says that this product

1362
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
doesn't work, you're done.

1363
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
If you're a startup, you're not done.

1364
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That's why startups can innovate very quickly.

1365
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I have a question.

1366
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
In one of your blog posts,

1367
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
you wrote,

1368
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
when we talked half a year ago,

1369
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
that you would make your own CRM,

1370
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and then integrate it.

1371
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
When we took your blog post in January or February,

1372
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
you pivoted.

1373
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Does that have anything to do with it?

1374
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Did you realize that you should approach it differently?

1375
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
No, the main reason why we pivoted,

1376
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and that's one of the more difficult things.

1377
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's very difficult.

1378
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You can write a lot,

1379
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
but you can't release it to people.

1380
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
You have to learn from someone else.

1381
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You have to do a lot of coding,

1382
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
but you have to pivot.

1383
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That's a very important discipline.

1384
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
At the beginning, when we started,

1385
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
there was a lot of metal.

1386
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The sunk cost was too high.

1387
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That discipline is key.

1388
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The main reason we did that

1389
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
was because we realized that the idea was to make CRM from scratch.

1390
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I wasn't aware of that at the time.

1391
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
VC told me it would be a problem.

1392
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If you make CRM from scratch,

1393
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
you'll work with small companies with very little money.

1394
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Let's say you get some money.

1395
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
When they get to the point where they have more money,

1396
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
they become so big

1397
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
that they won't be satisfied with your small CRM,

1398
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
which has basic functionalities,

1399
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
but you need a much smaller CRM,

1400
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
which has a lot of integrations,

1401
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
but you don't have a chance to develop them in half a year.

1402
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And you'll get lost.

1403
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That's why it's so small.

1404
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
In other words, the path to it is huge capital.

1405
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And we live in a region that doesn't have a lot of capital.

1406
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
One startup is very interesting,

1407
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Daypeak AI,

1408
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
which goes from top to bottom.

1409
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
They got a lot of money.

1410
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Here you have a 20-year history.

1411
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
When you run out of money, you get a new one.

1412
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But here, in our capital allocation world,

1413
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
it doesn't work like that.

1414
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You need to have proof points all the time.

1415
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'll give you an example.

1416
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
A few people I've talked to,

1417
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
both founders and co-founders,

1418
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
people who work in engineering in different companies,

1419
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
they've heard about the AI hype train,

1420
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and now they're putting an AI sticker on it,

1421
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
like there's no tomorrow,

1422
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and they get an AI sticker for obscure things.

1423
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
A lot of people say,

1424
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
we're making a product,

1425
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
the investors have nothing to do with AI,

1426
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
but some founders and investors

1427
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
tell us to put an AI sticker on it,

1428
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
because our evaluation will be better.

1429
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
On the other hand,

1430
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
we also take blog posts, articles and researches,

1431
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
when people see an AI sticker

1432
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and think it's unbearable,

1433
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
because people already have the impression

1434
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
that it's a negative connotation,

1435
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
because sometimes it means

1436
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
an incomplete product or a bad product

1437
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
due to certain weaknesses of the tools.

1438
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I'd like to ask you about that.

1439
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You wrote that you talked to a lot of VCs,

1440
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I think 30 plus VCs,

1441
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
do you feel like VCs are really looking for startups

1442
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
that are dealing with AI today?

1443
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
At the moment,

1444
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the tech scene is not at its best,

1445
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but do you feel like VCs are looking for companies

1446
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
that have a healthy AI sticker?

1447
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Is it a formula?

1448
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
There is a hard mentality, for sure.

1449
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
VCs, like everyone else, are very different.

1450
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You have 10% good,

1451
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
10% bad,

1452
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and then you have Gauss.

1453
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
A particularly acute problem in the VCs industry

1454
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
is that a lot of VCs

1455
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
don't have time to prove themselves,

1456
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
because they are in a 10-year cycle.

1457
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You make a fund,

1458
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
then it takes 10 years for you in the VCs to get to the proof point

1459
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
whether it's true or not.

1460
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
A lot of VCs make a fund,

1461
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
but no one makes another fund,

1462
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
because they invest in stuff and don't get anything out of it.

1463
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So it's hard to say what VCs are doing.

1464
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It's not as monolithic

1465
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
as you might think.

1466
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So there are definitely some that are working on it.

1467
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Some are down to earth.

1468
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
They will tell you that it doesn't matter

1469
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
what you show them.

1470
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
The problem is the scale of the users,

1471
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
we don't have a business.

1472
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
On the other hand,

1473
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
there's a lot of value in it.

1474
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So it's not just hype.

1475
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It's a lot of work.

1476
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
We are optimistic

1477
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
that it will grow.

1478
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
From my personal experience,

1479
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I was skeptical at first,

1480
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
but now that I use it in IDEA

1481
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
things are definitely changing a lot.

1482
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I haven't slept for a day.

1483
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
What's next?

1484
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I hope I can say something.

1485
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Will there be better models?

1486
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Did you know that the mid-layer

1487
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
where the added value is created

1488
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
when you work in an AI startup,

1489
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
will there be better models?

1490
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I think there will always be more

1491
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
impact on the distribution.

1492
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
As you said at the event.

1493
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The price of the software will go down.

1494
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
What the users will really value

1495
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
is the understanding of the problem

1496
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
and the users,

1497
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
what they really need and want.

1498
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You don't have to build AI alone.

1499
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You have to talk to people,

1500
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
you have to be there with them

1501
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and watch the world.

1502
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
As long as you can build it,

1503
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I think it will be very valuable.

1504
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I think that the whole mental world

1505
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
will be valued

1506
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and it will be a gift to the physical world.

1507
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
There will be a lot of changes.

1508
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
What Tesla does with these robots

1509
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and a couple of other firms

1510
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
is very interesting to me.

1511
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
All these robots will have

1512
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
some kind of general intelligence

1513
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
through these models.

1514
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
The robot will learn something,

1515
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
it will learn, it will do it,

1516
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and it will know.

1517
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
We will come back to this.

1518
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
The productivity will be

1519
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
because of the efficiency

1520
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and it will be done.

1521
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And in the end,

1522
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
the human element will remain.

1523
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I think it is very interesting.

1524
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
The IKEA will come later

1525
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and it will make the museum

1526
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
more valuable.

1527
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
In the end, we are still ready

1528
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
to pay for a unique museum

1529
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
where we know there is a museum.

1530
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I can't wait to see the code

1531
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
written by a programmer

1532
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and admire its beauty.

1533
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
If we don't destroy

1534
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
these sympathies,

1535
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
there will be nothing left.

1536
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You will be a programmer

1537
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
and I will be a commissioner.

1538
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I see some kind of visual

1539
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and aesthetic in my code.

1540
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Now for the audience

1541
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and for the guest,

1542
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
this is written by a rock,

1543
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
so it is very visual.

1544
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Andraž met a colleague

1545
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
at this conference

1546
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
who was in the construction site

1547
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
and Andraž mentored him.

1548
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
He said he is going back

1549
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
to the construction site.

1550
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
We need to do some media

1551
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
for the museum.

1552
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It will be a product

1553
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
that will be important in the future.

1554
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It will be a user experience

1555
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
in software.

1556
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It will reduce the amount

1557
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
of code written by programmers.

1558
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I think that this wave

1559
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
generates a lot of things

1560
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
that need to be done.

1561
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
From operations,

1562
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
to front-end,

1563
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
specialists, designers.

1564
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You have a great team of three.

1565
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I thought you said three or four.

1566
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You will probably need

1567
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
a mobile developer,

1568
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
a specialist.

1569
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Let's wrap it up for today.

1570
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The future will be funny,

1571
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
if not painful.

1572
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Vasy Jamel will write us AI.

1573
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Get out of the tower.

1574
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Or go to the tower.

1575
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Be brave before luck.

1576
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Before we say goodbye,

1577
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
thanks to Patreon, Kaldi, 3FS and Human Frogs.

1578
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Thanks to the team.

1579
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Thanks to Dragon Days for hosting us.

1580
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Thanks to our guest Nejc.

1581
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Let's listen to each other.

1582
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Good luck.
