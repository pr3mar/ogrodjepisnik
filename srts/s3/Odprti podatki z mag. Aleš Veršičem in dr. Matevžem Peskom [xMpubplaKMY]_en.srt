1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The first episode of the third season in Grodno.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Who would have thought that we would survive until the third season, but now we have started the third season.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Some kind of government.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, with brand new stickers, you see, we have a new merch.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The players have made the whole graphic design.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, we will start on all the channels, with a new look, new colors and a new melody.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Lara has also joined us to help spread the word and the sound to the younger population,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which we don't usually catch with the channels we are on now.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, this is the beginning of the intro.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I have a full-time job here today.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When I was doing some research, I saw that you have a bigger audience than I do.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, you have more in common with the audience than I do.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, if I ask you something awkward, I can fix it.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No problem.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was thinking today, when we started the podcast,

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
why would you have this podcast?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Who are the guests? Who will you invite?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I would like to talk to the director of Microsoft Slovenia.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What should Vršič have for Open Data?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Maybe 50K autologs and a letter.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
These are some of the topics we need to have.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We already had some other topics in previous seasons,

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but this episode with Open Data, I really hope we can start a new season with it,

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so that we can show people that this is open data,

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and that something interesting can be done with this data.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I would also like to find out what is the effort that needs to be put into making these data accessible,

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that they are prepared and up-to-date.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is one of the themes of this podcast,

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
with me Magister Aleš Vršič and Dr. Mateš Pesek from FRIA.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are the Minister of Digital Transformation.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Welcome, both of you.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My introductions are usually too long, so I don't want to lose the guest.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
As you can see, you also have the story that the autolog that was prepared and developed

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to the point where it is usable for the user,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
people use it and it is also integrated into the portal.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't remember the name.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Opsi?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Dobro auto?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, Dobro auto.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, you took open data, used it, developed products and integrated it into a bigger story.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Maybe we should start on your side.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, maybe a prelude to that.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I met you and Aleš in 2014 because of Žejna, my colleague.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ah, ok.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hruške.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Gašper.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Shout out, yes.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We met once in Kornar.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We started talking about data, what can be done with it, and then we started.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We started with one topic, our VSS studio, multimedia technology.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We started using this data as a theme for our seminar.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, we took the data, prepared what can be done with it.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
On the other hand, we had Aleš, Alenka Občaničnik, Marino Rajic in recent years,

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
who helped us keep in touch with all the agencies involved.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That was before Opsi portal.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
At the same time.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, a year later it came out.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you type opendata.si and go to the fifth page,

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
some projects are listed there.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It says 2012.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, Hruške.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I think Gašper was working on it at the time.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He was already very inspired by this data.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Opsi portal, later 2015-2016.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
December 2016.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, he was working on it.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We started with the data, and it was great.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We were Aleš, who was in touch with the agencies,

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
asking for data.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There were a lot of fears.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There was a lot of feeling of isolation from the agencies.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because when you give the data, people start to prepare what to do with it.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then, fast forward.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The students didn't find a way to use the data.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There were some interesting inconsistencies.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
For example, we took a state budget.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
People visualized the state budget,

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and it turned out that there is a bunch of projects,

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
a mass of projects worth billions,

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
where all projects are worth 100 euros.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really a lot.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I said, ok, cool, give me the money,

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and I'm happy for the next 10 generations.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It turned out that someone, at some point,

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when he wanted to open a project,

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
could give a minimum value, a minimum budget,

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
which was limited to 100 euros.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
These were projects that never took place.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In the state budget, it was still the same location,

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and we saw it in the visualization,

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
as a huge amount of money,

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
which is something, if it was never realized.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then, when we went to the visualization,

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the municipality used the data on payments,

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and the smaller municipality made more money.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Here you can see how optimal we were,

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
when it comes to using the data.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The smaller municipality used 2-3 dinars

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
for the payment from the municipality,

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and maybe the administrative person.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I know this story,

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
because we had Transparency International

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
take a state budget,

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and here there is a classic mistake

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
of an analyst,

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
when you notice an unusual deviation.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
As you said, the municipality pays,

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
but what is the catch?

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Some of the smaller municipalities

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
are members of the municipal council,

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and this municipality would be responsible

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
for 10 municipalities,

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and all the people who are employed

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
in this municipality,

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
work for these 10 municipalities.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And it is possible that there,

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the public expenditure is lower,

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and then there was a mistake,

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
one was in the data,

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and then there was an analyst,

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
who would have to alert the public,

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that there are some deviations,

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and check with the owner,

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
why these deviations occurred.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Either in the data,

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
in the decimal,

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
or in the public sector.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A lot of these things

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
can be easily solved,

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
because we always have a negotiator

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
on the other side.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It is much easier

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
if someone takes the data

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and downloads it,

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and then tries to get a contact.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The feedback is different

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
when there are different people.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
At Fast Forward,

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
at 1.2.18,

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
me and my colleague Vido,

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
who worked with us in Lebo,

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
sat down and said,

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
we are going to hack something on Saturday.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We looked at different pages,

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and said, let's write.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I said, the data in the cars,

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I told the student,

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
how old were the previous owners,

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
who they were, how old they were,

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
how many kilometers they had, etc.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I think that in January 2019,

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
while we were driving to the Danube,

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
on the E-Residency,

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the Estonian one,

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we deployed for the job,

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and since then,

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
we have had a lot of success.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A lot of positive feedback.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A lot of different stories.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
People were convinced

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that they were deceived,

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because they didn't want to look

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
at the technical reviews.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
A lot of people said,

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we have a completely different car.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Everyone gets a technical review,

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
but they don't look at it.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You made the document,

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you didn't look at it,

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and now you want the data to be hacked.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But it's cool.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's find a way

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to crowdsource the data back to the state.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We do this with a lot of bypasses,

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
because the MZI

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is a website

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
where you enter the size of your car,

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
or car,

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and you get the data,

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
how many kilometers the car had

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
for a certain period of time.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A complete technical review.

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What happened, was it successful,

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
was it unsuccessful,

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
what were the mistakes,

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
what are the measures

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
on all three levels of the technical review.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Not all people were

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
satisfied with this.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Some people who buy our cars

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
were less satisfied.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Some people weren't satisfied.

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I had a very interesting call

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
a year ago.

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Someone called me and said

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
it's good to have the data up,

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
because now everyone knows

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that he has BMW Analyzing.

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Now he writes that the owner is a legal person.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If he is a neighbor,

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
he could have bought it with Narem.

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A lot of such stories come out.

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But generally speaking,

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
this is the first step of the transparency

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
of our market, which was very broken.

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We added a database

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
of stolen vehicles

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There are also registration reports

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
for the stolen vehicles.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It is said that

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
out of 100 cars or other vehicles,

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the one that was stolen

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
was a successful technical review.

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The investigation was very suspicious.

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The police said that they didn't

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
find the stolen car.

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There were a lot of tweets about leasing.

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They called us from the leasing office

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and asked if we could get the car back.

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The police didn't do that.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We were a bit surprised.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
When you have a leasing office

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
in the background,

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
you don't know who you're talking to.

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If we go to Aleš now...

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I want to mention

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the story about Vinšte Vilko.

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If we had

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
our Ministry

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and the Ministry of Information

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and the Ministry of Infrastructure

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
meeting at the Information Commission,

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Vinšte Vilko would have

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
been prepared in one step.

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
According to some European regulations,

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Vinšte Vilko is a personal data.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In my opinion,

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it somehow influences

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
the car industry

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
how to limit access to these data.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You have to process all the data

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
related to Vinšte Vilko

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
via GDPR.

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It represents

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
a certain challenge.

250
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The Information Commission

251
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
approved the whole process.

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It took a lot of time.

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now,

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I have to change the law

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and write that

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Vinšte Vilko is a personal data

257
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and it can be public data.

258
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The land plot

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
for Vinšte Vilko is a personal data

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
if you have the last name

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and the owner of the plot.

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Vinšte Vilko is public

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and accessible.

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You search for Vinšte Vilko

265
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and you can get personal data.

266
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What about registration?

267
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Registration is also a personal data.

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Stealing vehicles have been reported.

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What happened

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
is that the police said

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
that they do not have a database

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
of stolen vehicles,

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
only the Information Commission.

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Since then, the police have been

275
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
updating the Information Commission.

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is a feedback

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
of the open data.

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can force the environment,

279
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the state as a whole

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
to make things better, more transparent

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and cleaner.

282
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
People don't understand

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that the consistency of data

284
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is an internal ongoing process.

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You don't do something

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and then let it go.

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's why

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
there is a fear.

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's a kind of personal data.

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But the problem is

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that someone has to be behind the scenes.

293
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Often in these polls,

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
it's someone who is

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
maybe half a year before retirement,

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
who has gone through a decade

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and knows everything in his head.

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can get this person

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and ask him directly

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
because he knows everything.

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All the laws,

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
who decided 15 years ago

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that something happened.

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Unfortunately, this is not the case.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We are not yet at the level

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
where you go up, take the data

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and everything will be clear

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
because you will be documenting it.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But all the polls have a repository, right?

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's right.

311
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They have a repository,

312
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
people who are responsible

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
for publishing the data

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
on the OPCI portal.

315
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There are different approaches.

316
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We have a system of harvesting

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and they send us updates

318
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
on which collection

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
may be removed,

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
which is a new collection,

321
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
which is being corrected.

322
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We have a similar situation

323
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
for geospatial data

324
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
by the City Administration,

325
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
which has a geoportal

326
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
under the directorate of WISPIRE.

327
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We read their descriptions

328
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
because the OPCI portal

329
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
would not be the central

330
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
source of information.

331
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We are not in the open data.

332
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We have two links on the OPCI portal

333
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
for some time now.

334
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
One is open data,

335
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the other is a collection

336
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
of information,

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
where the collections

338
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that are closed

339
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
are published.

340
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But it is important

341
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that the user knows

342
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
that this collection exists

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and that there were not

344
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
any other sources

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
where this information

346
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
could be obtained.

347
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's look at some statistics.

348
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
For example,

349
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the evidence of migrants

350
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
led by the police.

351
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I have an example

352
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
of a migrant

353
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
who walks through the state.

354
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Maybe the state is interested in them.

355
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Maybe they are interested

356
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
in the population

357
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and the dynamics.

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If this is published

359
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
as open data,

360
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
monthly and weekly statistics,

361
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
we can speculate

362
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
that the information

363
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
is more transparent

364
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and does not have to bluff

365
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and say that the migrant

366
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
is a dark-skinned person

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
with a dark will.

368
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We are also trying

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
with the group of

370
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Mateja Šumena,

371
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Lenka Marlina and Mateja Prešeran,

372
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
to not open

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the data

374
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
because it will

375
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
contain the most mistakes.

376
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I remember

377
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
when I was studying

378
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
at the University of Šumrada

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
for a PhD.

380
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In his book,

381
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
he said that the accuracy

382
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
of the data is very high.

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We will never be 100% sure.

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
One half of an investment

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is possible for today.

386
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The more data,

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the more mistakes can be made.

388
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I always say that

389
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
if you give data for free,

390
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
it is not a crime.

391
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But if you use it for free again,

392
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
everyone on this planet

393
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
can use this data.

394
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What is the benefit?

395
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We have also made

396
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
a contact window

397
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
where you can

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
contact the manager

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and tell him

400
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
to improve the data.

401
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The data should also

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
have a structural basis

403
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
for the policies.

404
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
As Mateo said,

405
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to watch the dynamics

406
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
of the data.

407
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sometimes it goes up,

408
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
sometimes it goes down.

409
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
When I thought about it,

410
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I realized

411
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
that we found

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
a problem in the system.

413
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The first step

414
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
is to have a technical overview

415
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
when you come in.

416
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And those who do

417
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
a technical overview

418
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
also look at the current

419
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
status of the data.

420
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You can't register the car

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
if it is broken.

422
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
A technical overview

423
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
also has to be a real

424
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
status of the data.

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Mateo just revealed

426
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
a bug in the system.

427
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Now the decision makers

428
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
have to fix the system.

429
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know the details

430
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
of the registration process.

431
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It is not a big deal

432
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
to have an autolog in your process.

433
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No.

434
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The autolog revealed

435
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the system difficulties.

436
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You improve the internal processes.

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There are a lot of things

438
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
where we were in a hurry.

439
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The minister and other agencies

440
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
told us to do it ourselves.

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
For example,

442
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
when we were in Furs,

443
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
we asked the minister

444
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
if we can get the data

445
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
on the state of the car

446
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
when we paid the taxes.

447
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It is said that

448
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
some amount

449
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is lost for some 100,000 km.

450
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You drive for a long distance

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
until you pay VAT,

452
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
then you drive for a long distance.

453
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The state has two data.

454
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
When you get the data

455
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
through a technical overview,

456
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
it is clear that someone is

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
fooling the state.

458
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It is not a chance.

459
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Half a year later,

460
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
they made an app

461
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
where they said it is

462
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the key data for the consumer.

463
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
On the one hand,

464
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
we told you that we wanted

465
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
to do it in the autolog,

466
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
but on the other hand,

467
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Furs was doing something

468
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
about it.

469
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
A lot of things can be

470
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
said about the damage

471
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
of a consumer buying a car.

472
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
On the other hand,

473
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
there is the safety aspect

474
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
on the road.

475
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We don't talk about it,

476
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so maybe the Minister of Health

477
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
or someone else could say

478
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
that if we have a car with half a million km,

479
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the catalyst does not work.

480
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We know that you don't fall

481
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
because of the catalyst.

482
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There is also the safety aspect

483
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
of servicing a car

484
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
on the motorway,

485
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
trucks, and so on.

486
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It is a big deal

487
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that when an agency

488
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
does something,

489
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it sometimes creates a million-dollar project.

490
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We had the opportunity

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
when we started doing it.

492
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We had the opportunity

493
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
when we started talking

494
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and we said it would be great

495
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
to have a meta-app for data

496
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
on LPPs, other cars,

497
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
intercity traffic,

498
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Avantigo,

499
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
all wheels, car-share,

500
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
bike-share, whatever it is.

501
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It was also a European project.

502
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We prepared a presentation

503
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
with Matejan Cerer from MOL.

504
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He said it would be great

505
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
if the municipality could get the data

506
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
because a lot of these things

507
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
are managed by the municipality,

508
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the coordinator, or the owner.

509
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Before we go to traffic,

510
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I would like to ask you

511
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that you have been working

512
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
in Autolok for a couple of years.

513
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You will tell me exactly how long.

514
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Probably 5 or 6 years.

515
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Every year you get a dump

516
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
for each year individually.

517
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What did you prepare

518
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
in those 5 years?

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What did you learn

520
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
in those 5 years?

521
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
About 95 million records.

522
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We have technical reviews,

523
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
which are 4 years or older.

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We have new registered vehicles,

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
we have some average data

526
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
for half a year.

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think the technical success

528
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
is still there for 9.5 years.

529
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Some are for a year,

530
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
some for a month,

531
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
when we have new registered vehicles.

532
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The interesting thing is

533
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that errors appear

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
when people re-write kilometers

535
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
from odometer to computer.

536
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
However, these errors

537
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
are much higher

538
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
in some German records.

539
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
In a way,

540
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
we can raise

541
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the transparency,

542
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
but on the other hand,

543
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
we often buy old German cars

544
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and pretend that they have

545
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
a small odometer.

546
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
In practice,

547
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
if there is a demand,

548
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
there will also be an offer.

549
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Another interesting thing

550
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
is that there are

551
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
an incredible number of people

552
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in other aspects of the purchase,

553
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
sale, maintenance of vehicles

554
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
who use Autolok.

555
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
For example, police officers,

556
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
car mechanics, etc.

557
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I have always found it fascinating,

558
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
because I would expect

559
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
that there are other choices.

560
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
For example,

561
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I talked to the leaders

562
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
of the test sector.

563
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They said that Autolok is great

564
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
because we can use it

565
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
to reduce the damage

566
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
on cars that have been

567
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
turned over a few times.

568
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Then we get some harmful examples

569
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
of a very expensive vehicle

570
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
that had only 100,000 kilometers

571
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and then it turns out

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
that five years ago

573
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it had 400,000 kilometers.

574
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This means that the estimated

575
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
value of the vehicle as a whole

576
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
may have paid off.

577
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We are talking about a couple

578
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
of tens of thousands of euros.

579
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
People are very happy

580
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and we are very happy.

581
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If you were to use

582
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
this data,

583
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
would you also create

584
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
a data stream

585
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
or give it back?

586
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What we are doing

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is that Autolok has provided

588
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
us with a process

589
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
on how to correct this data

590
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
for the state.

591
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If you make sure

592
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that your data is correct,

593
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and then also in Autolok,

594
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
where we don't get an update,

595
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to correct it to the extent

596
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that the data is consistent.

597
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What we did was a bypass

598
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
of what most people

599
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
would like to have by default.

600
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Maybe it wasn't a political choice

601
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
to do this in the last five or six years,

602
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
so that the data

603
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
is better,

604
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
more transparent,

605
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
more consistent.

606
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We have opened

607
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
the whole NAPI.

608
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You have to stand up now.

609
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Sorry, sorry.

610
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I will just ask you

611
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
if you have a microphone.

612
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I will ask you.

613
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What are

614
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the good

615
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
holders of this data for you?

616
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Are they

617
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
researchers?

618
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Are they people

619
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
who integrate it into products?

620
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Or do you know everything?

621
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Do you get any feedback

622
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
from use cases?

623
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Basically,

624
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
we only complain

625
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
because we don't have enough feedback.

626
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
For Mateo, we already know

627
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
the individuals who give us feedback.

628
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We would like more of this.

629
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Because on the basis of this feedback,

630
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
we also benefit from

631
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
what the European Commission

632
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
estimates every year,

633
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
how mature we are as a state

634
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
in terms of data,

635
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and what we are proud of.

636
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The last message from the OECD in December

637
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
was that we are

638
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
within the OECD state,

639
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
we are speaking for the whole world,

640
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
we are in the top 10,

641
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
in the 7th place.

642
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I drank a lot of coffee because of that.

643
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You are talking with a laptop,

644
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
give me another one.

645
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The European Commission

646
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is satisfied with the number of places.

647
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
According to the percentage points,

648
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
we are still at the same,

649
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
we are still in the 15th place.

650
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But we should know that

651
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
when we look at the OECD,

652
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
four years ago,

653
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
among the top 10 states,

654
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the OECD had 5 European states

655
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and 5 non-European states.

656
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
In the last message,

657
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
there were 9 European states and 1 non-European,

658
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
South Korea.

659
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I want to say that

660
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
the European Commission,

661
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
according to its estimates,

662
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
has improved the culture

663
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and the view of open data

664
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
at the level of Europe.

665
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Europe is a global unit.

666
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We are happy

667
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and I am happy

668
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to meet my colleagues

669
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
from all over the world.

670
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Europe,

671
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
when it comes to access to data,

672
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is at the top,

673
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
among the best in the continent

674
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and in the global system.

675
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Africa is a sad story, other countries are buying their data,

676
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Asia is also a sad story, USA, Canada and South America are trying to make some progress.

677
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Europe is a real mess in the last 4-5 years,

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and I have to say that the public will understand,

679
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
that the process of opening the data started 20 years ago.

680
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
There was also the information value,

681
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
the first law that enabled the access of information value,

682
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
which evolved over time,

683
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I will talk about it in the European Directive on Open Data,

684
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
in Slovenia we have the law on the access of information value.

685
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Here the public should pay attention to one thing,

686
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
we have the law on the access of information value,

687
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
if someone demanded from the institution to have data for the information value,

688
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
he had to get a PDF.

689
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Then the state institution fulfilled this demand.

690
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It is in digital form.

691
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If you say you want to have data for re-use,

692
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and here is the catch,

693
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
you have to have data for re-use,

694
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
you have to have data in digital form.

695
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And this is where the machine intelligence comes in.

696
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Excel is also based on it.

697
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't scan the PDF anymore, but I type the PDF.

698
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
No, no, no.

699
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
There are clear criteria,

700
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
the digital format means that it is based on the table of contents.

701
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Passable.

702
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We have at least three stars in open formats,

703
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
CSV, XML, JSON.

704
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
PDF, Excel, Word, absolutely not.

705
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Even if someone publishes,

706
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
we have a system order.

707
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
If an institution publishes some data,

708
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and if it publishes Excel,

709
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
this collection will not be visible as open data.

710
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It will be visible only as information value.

711
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You can open them in Excel.

712
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We know that you can open Excel in any other program.

713
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
However, if we are strict,

714
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and this is why we said that we don't want a person to decide.

715
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We have decided on the rules of the game,

716
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
we have decided on formats that are readily available,

717
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and if the uploader does not meet these criteria,

718
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it will simply not be open data,

719
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and it can become a headache.

720
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Here you have to hit something.

721
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
These data are published in some CSVs.

722
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
However, these data are somewhat manually dumped,

723
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
which means that every year we have a special challenge

724
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
on how to parse these CSVs.

725
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
For example, headers are manually corrected.

726
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
When WTF16 is set to WTF8,

727
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
someone in some column header

728
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
presses Enter, then Z,

729
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and you have a new line, then Z,

730
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
the names of the columns are changed.

731
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
For example, we have a whole function

732
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
for the age of the carrier,

733
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
because someone calculates every year

734
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
what the age of the carrier is.

735
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You don't get the year of birth,

736
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
which would be a fixed data,

737
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and someone who runs this script every year

738
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
will of course forget to put plus one on the current year.

739
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
When you read the data,

740
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and then you have data between 2.12 and 2.14,

741
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
which are all equal,

742
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
because someone forgot to put plus one on the years.

743
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So we rely on individual examples

744
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
on how we can generalize these tasks.

745
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
For example, the last dump of data

746
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that was published on Ops.java

747
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
doesn't have a single letter in it.

748
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I mean, ID or whatever,

749
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
everything is a letter.

750
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
There are a lot of such problems

751
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that were reported,

752
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and the question is if they will ever be changed.

753
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So you have to realize that

754
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
all data are manually variable.

755
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Garbage in, garbage out.

756
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Matej, if you remember,

757
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
one of the previous ministers,

758
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Boris Goprivnik,

759
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
came out of his cell,

760
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
of course, all hyped up.

761
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
He introduced us to the students,

762
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and the student said,

763
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
what is the problem with the data?

764
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That Mercedes-Benz is recorded in the data

765
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
in seven different ways.

766
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Because there is no code

767
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
that would say

768
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Mercedes-Benz,

769
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and everyone who is involved

770
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
in the system

771
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
wouldn't need,

772
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, no one would have to worry

773
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
about the code.

774
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Now we have changed it.

775
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
To be fair,

776
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
if we go to a bigger or larger company

777
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and look at systems

778
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that have been in production

779
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
for 10, 15, God forbid, 20 years,

780
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
the question is what is in there.

781
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But here you can look at it

782
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
as a problem.

783
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Shit, we won't open the data

784
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
because people will know we have the data.

785
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You can look at it as an opportunity.

786
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We will open the data,

787
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and people will steal the source.

788
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't have my own personnel

789
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
who will go to a 30-year-old database

790
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
to check it,

791
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
but others will do it instead of us

792
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and they will explain the inconsistencies

793
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and we will be able to counteract

794
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
our process.

795
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What are the biggest fears

796
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
on the other side?

797
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Do you mean that you will leak

798
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
some personal data?

799
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
No, I mean personal data.

800
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I think that in Slovenia

801
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
people are very careful

802
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and they check twice

803
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and there are processes.

804
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It is very difficult

805
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
to leak personal data.

806
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Of course,

807
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
hypothetically,

808
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
from one record

809
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
you could anonymize

810
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
a tractor

811
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
from a 50-year-old woman

812
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
from a smaller municipality.

813
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
We won't know

814
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
which person it is.

815
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No one will know,

816
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
but this person already knows

817
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
what kind of tractor it is.

818
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
From personal data,

819
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
it is a topic

820
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
where you can anonymize

821
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
a person who is the only tractor

822
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
in the municipality,

823
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
but I always ask

824
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
if anyone in the world

825
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
knows what kind of tractor it is.

826
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What are the conditions

827
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
for Mateuš

828
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
when he uses the data?

829
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Does he have to

830
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
delete the data

831
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
in some conditions?

832
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Can he work with them

833
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
as he wishes?

834
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
No, no,

835
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
all the data

836
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
in Euroterm

837
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
are translations

838
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
that are a part

839
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
of the author's work.

840
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We use all CC BY licenses,

841
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
four and nothing.

842
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
CC BY is

843
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Creative Commons.

844
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
For example,

845
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Euroterm is a translation

846
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
that is a part of the author's work

847
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and is not commercial.

848
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It can also be used

849
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
for commercial purposes.

850
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Even if Mateuš makes a business

851
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and earns millions,

852
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
so be it,

853
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
he will pay for public service

854
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and so on,

855
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
because he will pay

856
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
as much as he can

857
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and he will get the money

858
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
in installments.

859
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I want to say

860
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
that basically

861
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
all data levels

862
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
are exclusive to

863
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
100% of the data.

864
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This happens to us as well.

865
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We had this experience with

866
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
car data.

867
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We get these annual and

868
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
half-annual installments.

869
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
There is a company that

870
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
charges you 10 euros

871
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
for the same data,

872
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and the next day

873
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
you will have the data

874
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
in your technical review.

875
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I spoke to the developer

876
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and he asked me

877
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
if he could give him more data.

878
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I told him that we didn't have time

879
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
to deal with this.

880
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I wrote to the minister

881
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and he agreed to the meeting.

882
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I asked him if he would give me

883
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
the data. He said no.

884
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I told him that I know developers

885
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and he wrote me an email

886
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
to give me the data.

887
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You pay for the data,

888
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
but there is only one

889
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
commercial company that

890
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
provides the data.

891
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
We are trying to get

892
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
all the data equally.

893
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
On the other hand,

894
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
when we develop these stories

895
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
for other projects,

896
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
we are creating a buffer

897
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
for agencies that don't have to

898
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
transfer the data to the state

899
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
for the infrastructure to

900
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
share it.

901
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We will share the data,

902
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
we will provide it,

903
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and our infrastructure will take care

904
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
of it.

905
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If you find an example

906
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
where you think

907
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
that this is not what it should be,

908
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
you should contact

909
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the information officer

910
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
or the Ministry of Justice

911
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
if you are responsible for the law.

912
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You should warn them

913
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
to come to the opinion

914
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
of the users

915
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
of the law and

916
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
it will be done.

917
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
If no one knows

918
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
that this is a problem,

919
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
no one will solve it.

920
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I am one of those people

921
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
who think that we are not children.

922
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I know that the API exists.

923
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The developer knows that the API exists.

924
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The developer wants the data access

925
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
if you confirm it.

926
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You pay for the API,

927
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
but we still pretend that it doesn't exist.

928
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Sorry.

929
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It is relatively easy to check.

930
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Autopilot, technical inspection,

931
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and the next day

932
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
you go to a website

933
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
where you write your data

934
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
about your car.

935
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The API exists.

936
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The economy exists.

937
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There is some access.

938
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
On the other hand...

939
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I will ask you a lot of questions.

940
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We are now part

941
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
of the European Union.

942
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This law is the directive of the EU.

943
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Can Autolog do for the German market?

944
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It is not that simple.

945
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We have different interpretations

946
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
in different countries.

947
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The Germans are very interested

948
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
in private data mining.

949
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The German industry also

950
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
forces private data mining

951
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
because they have other business interests.

952
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
They could not do it

953
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
for their market

954
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
because they would have a lot of problems,

955
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
but for Italy it would be easier.

956
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I think that here we have

957
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
an opportunity

958
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
if the Balkans

959
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
are transformed.

960
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The car is three times new.

961
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
First in Germany, second in Slovenia,

962
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and third in the Balkans.

963
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
In order to cover this part

964
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
unfortunately or luckily,

965
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
some data

966
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
cannot be obtained

967
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
because in Germany

968
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
cars undergo technical inspection

969
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
after three years.

970
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You have that period.

971
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Exactly.

972
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
A lot of cars sold in Slovenia

973
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
have 3,000 cars in their fleet,

974
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
have their own mechanics,

975
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
do not go to a BMW service.

976
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
German cars

977
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
come to Slovenia

978
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
as little needed,

979
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
but all of these cars

980
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
cover 300,000 kilometers.

981
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
In order to cover

982
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
any service,

983
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
they have to cover kilometers.

984
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Audi A6

985
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
is the year 2016.

986
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You ask yourself how you can

987
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
not have Audi A6.

988
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
These cars often

989
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
have very strange

990
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
combinations of equipment.

991
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Handles,

992
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
tailpipes,

993
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
it does not fit into the context.

994
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You will not know anything about these cars.

995
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
For cars that have

996
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
some damage data,

997
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
you will know

998
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
that there may have been some damage.

999
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We also talk a lot about

1000
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
how nice it would be

1001
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
to have a car like this

1002
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
in Slovenia.

1003
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It would be phenomenal

1004
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
to know that a car

1005
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that had so much value

1006
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
did not have so much damage.

1007
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
If you have a 20-year-old car

1008
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and it fell to the ground,

1009
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
it is probably an economic total.

1010
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But you know

1011
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that it cost

1012
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
around 1,000 euros.

1013
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
On the basis of this,

1014
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
you could decide

1015
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
what was the real damage.

1016
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
On the other hand,

1017
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
people who have a helmet paint their car,

1018
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
fix every crack.

1019
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The damage is also 1,000 euros per year,

1020
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
but the damage is probably more

1021
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
because someone took care of the vehicle

1022
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
than because the vehicle was damaged.

1023
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It would definitely be much more

1024
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
transparent for people

1025
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
in the market of vehicles.

1026
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Let's try to push it to the extent

1027
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
that an average person

1028
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
who goes to buy a car

1029
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
can call three neighbors

1030
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and five mechanics

1031
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
to buy a buggy car

1032
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
to go back to the market.

1033
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Let's talk a little bit

1034
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
about business models

1035
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
over open data.

1036
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You could decide

1037
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
at some point

1038
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
to go to AutoLock.

1039
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
If you type in the red arrow,

1040
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you pay X and get the data.

1041
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We are doing this with AMZS.

1042
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
AutoLock will discover AMZS.

1043
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
They work in a public interest.

1044
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
AutoLock is a service

1045
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
for their larger product.

1046
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Also for their products.

1047
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
For a good car.

1048
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
On the other hand,

1049
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
with a good car,

1050
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
this is my personal opinion,

1051
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
maybe not their position,

1052
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
but what they tried to do

1053
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
with a good car.

1054
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Let's sell a car,

1055
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
but we won't make cars

1056
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
as transparent as possible.

1057
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This game of questions

1058
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and offers

1059
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
is still running on some

1060
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
other portals,

1061
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
but it's important

1062
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
to keep it open.

1063
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Not only that,

1064
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
but here you have

1065
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
the whole graph.

1066
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Of course, this means

1067
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
a lot more overhead

1068
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
for a product.

1069
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's a lot easier

1070
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
to do it without it.

1071
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I don't know how we would

1072
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
do it without it.

1073
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It would look like

1074
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
there are a million kilometers

1075
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
instead of a hundred thousand.

1076
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This is also happening.

1077
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But let's be realistic.

1078
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
There are less than a percent

1079
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
of such relationships.

1080
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We have more than 3%

1081
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
of negative kilometers

1082
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
on the summer level.

1083
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
All these 2%

1084
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
we celebrate with this.

1085
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's jump a bit further.

1086
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
In the OPSI portal,

1087
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
which is a search engine,

1088
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
you can search for words

1089
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and get the records.

1090
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
These are the

1091
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
names of the collections.

1092
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Then there are different formats.

1093
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Do you decide

1094
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
which formats

1095
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
they will be in?

1096
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Do you also transform them?

1097
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Or did someone

1098
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
give you the data?

1099
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
In certain cases,

1100
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
it is up to the legislator

1101
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
to decide the format.

1102
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
For example,

1103
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the geospatial data

1104
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
is decided by the

1105
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
directorate.

1106
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
There is

1107
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
a self-decision

1108
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
organization.

1109
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
We try to separate them

1110
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
from Excel.

1111
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We try to

1112
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
separate them from

1113
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
CSV,

1114
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
but it is not a big deal.

1115
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
We are also

1116
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
following the example of Montenegro.

1117
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Older people know

1118
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
the views of Montenegro

1119
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and their productivity.

1120
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
They showed us

1121
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
how they allowed

1122
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
anyone to publish

1123
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Excel in their

1124
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
open data portal.

1125
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Then we decided

1126
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
to add them.

1127
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We have certain collections

1128
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
that are published in Excel.

1129
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
We have an app

1130
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
where you can

1131
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
add JSON,

1132
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
XML,

1133
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
formats that

1134
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
allow you to get the data.

1135
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Even if someone publishes it in Excel,

1136
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
we have tools

1137
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
that allow you to add it

1138
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
in a different way.

1139
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Mateo, in your example,

1140
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I think that

1141
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
you are working on your app

1142
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
in CSV.

1143
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You work on your database,

1144
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and then on the database.

1145
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
In your collection,

1146
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
you also have apps that are not only read-only.

1147
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You also have write-only,

1148
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
which is based on authentication.

1149
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Not yet.

1150
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
We also have

1151
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
a common app module

1152
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
which would be a catalog

1153
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
of all app users

1154
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and their documentation.

1155
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You should know that

1156
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
the last version of the

1157
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
European Directive on Open Data

1158
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
includes a term

1159
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
called the High Value Dataset.

1160
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It includes collections of high value.

1161
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
For these collections

1162
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and for each of them,

1163
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
there must be

1164
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
data available to the app user.

1165
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
We will create an area

1166
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
for data

1167
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
on geospatial data,

1168
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
data on land and environment,

1169
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
environmental data,

1170
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
satellite images,

1171
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
meteorological data,

1172
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
statistical data,

1173
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
data on the register

1174
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
of business objects,

1175
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and data on mobility.

1176
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
These are the six areas

1177
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
for which it is already

1178
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
prescribed that

1179
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
the app users

1180
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
must be created,

1181
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
which will enable

1182
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
the app user to get

1183
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
this data.

1184
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's great for us.

1185
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
The first step for all developers

1186
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
is to have easy access

1187
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
to the data,

1188
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
so they don't have to download

1189
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and convert it themselves.

1190
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The app must be created here.

1191
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Does this mean that

1192
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the Ministry of Digital Transformation

1193
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
will have a coordinator

1194
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
for this?

1195
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Does this mean

1196
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that you will develop the app

1197
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
or will you manage it?

1198
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Most state bodies

1199
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
are centralized.

1200
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
They have all the infrastructure

1201
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
in our Ministry.

1202
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
They are part of the

1203
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
state government.

1204
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They have the freedom

1205
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
to use the hardware

1206
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and software.

1207
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
As far as I know,

1208
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
the Ministry of Digital Transformation

1209
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
has already created

1210
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
the app users

1211
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
according to the Inspire Directive.

1212
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Most of the data

1213
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
was created

1214
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
according to the Inspire Directive.

1215
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
When Europe came to a compromise

1216
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and decided not to impose

1217
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
additional costs

1218
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
on the Ministry of State

1219
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
to develop the app,

1220
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
they used some solutions

1221
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and regulations

1222
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
that determined

1223
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
the amount of time

1224
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
required for the application

1225
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
and the amount of downtime

1226
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
for the maximum number of years.

1227
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
There are some rules

1228
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and regulations

1229
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
that regulate

1230
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
the data.

1231
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The administration

1232
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
must know

1233
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
which regulations regulate it.

1234
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
If you want to get something,

1235
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
you need to know what it is for.

1236
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We have GDPR for personal data

1237
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and how you can get personal data.

1238
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Then we have the Directive on Open Data.

1239
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We have the Inspire Directive.

1240
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Then we have

1241
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
the European Free Flow

1242
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
of Personal Data,

1243
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
where the state can

1244
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
remove certain data

1245
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
from the state that has

1246
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
a strategic interest.

1247
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Then we have two more regulations

1248
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
that were adopted

1249
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
last year

1250
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
that will bring a revolution.

1251
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
One is the Governance Act

1252
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
that regulates terms

1253
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
such as data intermediaries.

1254
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
These are the amount of mail

1255
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
for the transfer of mail and packages.

1256
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
These will be designed

1257
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
to allow intermediaries

1258
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
to exchange data between two subjects.

1259
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Like brokers?

1260
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yes, they must prepare

1261
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
technical and legal support.

1262
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
They prepare an agreement

1263
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
to exchange personal and business data

1264
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
between two entities.

1265
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
In this way,

1266
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
it is possible to legally

1267
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and safely exchange data.

1268
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This data will then be

1269
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
notified.

1270
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You just need to register

1271
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
your activity

1272
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and it can then start

1273
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
all over Europe.

1274
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
At the moment,

1275
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
there is only one Finnish company

1276
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
that deals with this.

1277
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
My call to companies

1278
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
is that this is a business opportunity.

1279
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
This will then be implemented

1280
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
in the data space

1281
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
where it will be necessary

1282
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
to legally and safely exchange data.

1283
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Those who will be the first

1284
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
will be the first.

1285
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Then there is one

1286
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
that is similarly revolutionary

1287
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
due to the EU's involvement

1288
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
on the global stage.

1289
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It is the Data Act

1290
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
that encourages

1291
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
everyone who has

1292
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
a computer or a device

1293
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
to share their data

1294
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
whether it is a smart watch

1295
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
or a smart car.

1296
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
My data, which I have created

1297
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
with this product,

1298
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I want to share

1299
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
with Mateo and you.

1300
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
He will have to

1301
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
provide us

1302
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
access to this data

1303
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
for free.

1304
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
All companies outside

1305
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
of Europe

1306
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
that will not respect

1307
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
this data

1308
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
will not be able

1309
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
to access it.

1310
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
As with GDPR,

1311
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
if you want to use

1312
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
an American watch,

1313
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
you are from Europe,

1314
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
we are not interested in GDPR,

1315
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
you will not be able

1316
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
to access it.

1317
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
This Data Act will

1318
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
bring a revolution.

1319
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It also talks about

1320
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
a simpler transition

1321
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
so that it will be built

1322
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
into the price of the device.

1323
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Theoretically,

1324
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
is it possible to present

1325
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
a picture on the Apple Cloud

1326
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and then choose Google Photos?

1327
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Both on Azure.

1328
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Both on Azure.

1329
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
No, because if

1330
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
someone does not have

1331
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
enough space

1332
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and then they want

1333
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
to take some other data,

1334
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
it would have to be seamless.

1335
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
They will build it

1336
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
into the price of the device

1337
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and will say,

1338
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
you will not pay this much,

1339
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
but you will pay more.

1340
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I expect it to be like that.

1341
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
You have to be careful

1342
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
with regard to state bodies.

1343
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
We will do it legally,

1344
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
we have legal framework and so on.

1345
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We have DRO,

1346
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
the state cloud.

1347
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
A lot of agencies

1348
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
that would potentially

1349
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
publish data,

1350
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
or are bound to publish data

1351
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
in general, do not have it.

1352
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Because they do not have

1353
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
a frame or tech support,

1354
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
or they do not have

1355
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
the API running somewhere,

1356
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
so they have to program it.

1357
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Here I see the open data community.

1358
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
What we have been doing

1359
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and are still doing,

1360
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
in a way,

1361
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
how to hack it,

1362
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
we will prepare

1363
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
an initial access point,

1364
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
we will prepare it,

1365
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
we will send the data,

1366
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and finally publish it in the community.

1367
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It is not necessary

1368
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
to have a small community

1369
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
or an agency

1370
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
with 5 employees,

1371
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
they will be able to prepare it.

1372
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It will not happen,

1373
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
because they physically do not have it.

1374
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,680
things under ZDiAZ, or whatever you send, and then give it back to the sector, and it won't happen.

1375
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,360
And here we have an opportunity to do that, because we can do something more with it.

1376
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:17,360
I mean, probably in your position, it's a lot more pleasant than you can say,

1377
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,080
where is the scope where the OPSI portal ends, and you say,

1378
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,080
ok, that's good, but it's not out of our reach.

1379
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:30,959
I can give you an example from Ogrod, I can tell you about networking.

1380
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:35,919
Networking is now a top topic, and it is changing,

1381
00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:39,919
although not so dramatically, but it is changing.

1382
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:41,919
And it is changing with inflation, right?

1383
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:46,880
It is changing, there is now a portal,

1384
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
myelectro.si, I think that's the title,

1385
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
which is used by other distributors,

1386
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,880
there you sign up with a certificate and get data from those emitters.

1387
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,680
There is now a lot of interest in the hacker space,

1388
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,680
the hacker community, if you will,

1389
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
and also in our Ogrod community, we now have programmers

1390
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,680
who deal with visualizing, and they want to calculate these things themselves.

1391
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,680
And now, for example, 4-5 different prototypes,

1392
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,680
or full-fledged products,

1393
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,680
which now deal with how graphs look,

1394
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,680
or also model the use.

1395
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,680
And now, for example,

1396
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
they ask themselves, ok, I make this product,

1397
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,480
it is probably fully usable,

1398
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,480
how can I get it open-sourced,

1399
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
with an option,

1400
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
with some approach,

1401
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
so that the tool that solves the problem

1402
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
gets some kind of backing, in a broad sense.

1403
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
That's what I mentioned about data management.

1404
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,480
In this example,

1405
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,480
if you could visualize your data from your emitter

1406
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,480
to someone else,

1407
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
especially where you can pay attention to,

1408
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
where you go over those walls,

1409
00:51:51,279 --> 00:51:53,279
you could create a network log,

1410
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:55,279
or a stream log,

1411
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,279
or something like that,

1412
00:51:57,279 --> 00:51:59,279
and give them your data,

1413
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:01,279
for example.

1414
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:03,279
We now have an optional dilemma,

1415
00:52:03,279 --> 00:52:05,279
we went to a point,

1416
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:07,279
in December 2016,

1417
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:09,279
the portal was set up in this form,

1418
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:11,279
before that,

1419
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,279
the open data was determined

1420
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:15,279
on the NIO portal,

1421
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:17,279
so we will say

1422
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,279
that this is an optional option.

1423
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,080
At the end of the phase,

1424
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,080
if we talk about a digital society,

1425
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
and I am the director of a digital society,

1426
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,080
data is also a part

1427
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,080
of the digital community,

1428
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,080
and it would seem

1429
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
that the data

1430
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,080
should also open up

1431
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,080
its data,

1432
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,080
of course,

1433
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,080
due to the existence

1434
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,080
of personal data.

1435
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
I know an example,

1436
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,080
when I was still studying for a Data Steward,

1437
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,880
and there was a representative

1438
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,880
of MasterCard,

1439
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
who said that

1440
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,880
they share certain data

1441
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
for the community.

1442
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,880
This is a concept

1443
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,880
that is still coming to Europe,

1444
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,880
and America has replaced

1445
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
the sharing of data

1446
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
with a much more advanced one.

1447
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,880
I mean, for the money.

1448
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,880
For the money,

1449
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
for the money.

1450
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:17,679
In my opinion,

1451
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:19,679
it seems to me

1452
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,679
that in America

1453
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:23,679
there is only one step forward.

1454
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,679
Europe, of course,

1455
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,679
is successful,

1456
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,679
and it seems to me

1457
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,679
that we can also

1458
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:33,679
publish data,

1459
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:35,679
describe their collection

1460
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,679
based on open data

1461
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:39,679
on the OPCI portal.

1462
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:41,679
This is the dilemma

1463
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:43,679
that we now have

1464
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:46,479
where data is published,

1465
00:53:46,479 --> 00:53:48,479
and we have this data

1466
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:50,479
and we want to share it.

1467
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:52,479
I mean, this is a database,

1468
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,479
right?

1469
00:53:54,479 --> 00:53:56,479
No, this is a business registry,

1470
00:53:56,479 --> 00:53:58,479
but if you have a registry,

1471
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:00,479
only data.

1472
00:54:00,479 --> 00:54:02,479
You have to understand

1473
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:04,479
that this fear of sharing data

1474
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:06,479
initially stems from the fear

1475
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:08,479
of not understanding what you have.

1476
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,479
Also at the state level.

1477
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:12,479
We will not share it,

1478
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:15,279
but it is a kind of power.

1479
00:54:15,279 --> 00:54:17,279
If you have information

1480
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:19,279
that someone else has,

1481
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:21,279
it is also an easy position.

1482
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:23,279
It is the same for companies.

1483
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:25,279
Companies say,

1484
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,279
we will open some data,

1485
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:29,279
probably at the level

1486
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:31,279
where you say,

1487
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:33,279
go open the data,

1488
00:54:33,279 --> 00:54:35,279
everyone would say,

1489
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:37,279
come on, whatever.

1490
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:39,279
If you have individual use cases,

1491
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:41,279
how would it look usable?

1492
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,079
Maybe we are interested

1493
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,079
in their sensors under the glass,

1494
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,079
which are really very interesting

1495
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,079
for the community,

1496
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,079
how many steps are there for the glass.

1497
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,079
Outside of this framework,

1498
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,079
this is just my primary activity.

1499
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,079
I probably have a bunch of other sensors

1500
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,079
that would be very useful.

1501
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,079
For example,

1502
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,079
if we live in Ljubljana

1503
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,079
and we know that

1504
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,079
the water level is over 1.9 TDI,

1505
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,079
which means that everyone has to go to church

1506
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
in the winter, the air is polluted.

1507
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
Now you have a couple of peaceful cities

1508
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,880
that are organized.

1509
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,880
At the beginning,

1510
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,880
it is not too close to big cities anymore.

1511
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,880
In Slovenia, there was one,

1512
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
but Slovenia is now closed,

1513
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,880
so we have a clean air.

1514
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,880
It is lower in the population.

1515
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
It is logical,

1516
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
but if we go to Tivoli,

1517
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
we will probably have a different picture.

1518
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,880
How many people,

1519
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
how many companies,

1520
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:41,679
where we can collect this data more precisely

1521
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,679
and we have a much better reality

1522
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,679
of what is happening.

1523
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:47,679
The average values that we collect

1524
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,679
are finally published in the newspaper.

1525
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,679
In Ljubljana, the average value

1526
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:53,679
was 6 times a year,

1527
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:55,679
or 20 times a year.

1528
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:57,679
We still exceed the average number of days

1529
00:55:57,679 --> 00:55:59,679
in which we can exceed,

1530
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:01,679
but in reality,

1531
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,679
I live in Šiška,

1532
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:05,679
a lot of people still smoke on the trees,

1533
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:07,679
the air is terrible.

1534
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,480
Maybe, Mateo,

1535
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,480
as you said, crowdsourcing.

1536
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,480
As I mentioned earlier,

1537
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,480
you are a prime minister,

1538
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,480
so you have to sign everything.

1539
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
The government says

1540
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,480
to cut it short,

1541
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,480
but there are a lot of shortcomings.

1542
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,480
Someone has to deal

1543
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,480
with these shortcomings,

1544
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,480
and with the government.

1545
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
If you don't deal with it,

1546
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,480
then it falls on you.

1547
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,480
I mean,

1548
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:39,279
if you don't deal with what you know,

1549
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,279
then you have to deal

1550
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:43,279
with some policies.

1551
00:56:43,279 --> 00:56:45,279
We have to thank Aleš.

1552
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:47,279
He is from our point of view,

1553
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,279
as a user of this data,

1554
00:56:49,279 --> 00:56:51,279
and a provider of some services.

1555
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:53,279
Aleš, Lenka, Marina,

1556
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:55,279
and Mateo,

1557
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,279
that's a shout-out.

1558
00:56:57,279 --> 00:56:59,279
They are part of MEU,

1559
00:56:59,279 --> 00:57:01,279
and now MDP and MEU,

1560
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:03,279
where we accept calls

1561
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:05,279
where we really don't have to change,

1562
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,079
where we look at the state

1563
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,079
as an encapsulated note,

1564
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,079
internally does these things

1565
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,079
in a way that we don't have

1566
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,079
to write it down,

1567
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,079
but someone tells you

1568
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,079
that they could give the data.

1569
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,079
If the representative

1570
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,079
didn't publish all the data,

1571
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,079
we would punish him by law.

1572
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,079
But I am a supporter

1573
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,079
of some kind of coercion.

1574
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,079
Let's talk to people

1575
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,079
in a softer way,

1576
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,880
let's praise those

1577
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
who are good,

1578
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,880
and not the ones

1579
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880
who are bad.

1580
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,880
For example,

1581
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,880
I have to praise the Minister

1582
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
of Finance,

1583
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,880
their website is prolecum.go.si.

1584
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,880
Slovenia is one of the rare countries

1585
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
in the world

1586
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
where you can see

1587
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,880
the daily use of state money.

1588
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,880
They change every day

1589
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
how much money we used yesterday,

1590
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,880
and how much we collected from taxes.

1591
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
That's good.

1592
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
It's a lot of transparency.

1593
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
I don't know,

1594
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
you can also look

1595
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
at all the past calculations.

1596
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
You can also see

1597
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
how much money is used for education.

1598
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,880
Some people say

1599
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
that they are gods,

1600
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,880
then you go to the graph

1601
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,880
and see how much money is used

1602
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,880
for education, culture,

1603
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,880
and more or less.

1604
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,880
Now we are preparing

1605
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
to publish more data

1606
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,880
with them,

1607
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,880
I don't know if I can tell you.

1608
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,880
It will be very interesting

1609
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,880
because of the blog posts.

1610
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
So, wait for the data

1611
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
on the OPSI portal.

1612
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
With the help of Mateuž,

1613
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,880
who is a colleague

1614
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,880
of the Minister of Finance,

1615
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,880
the engine and the foundation

1616
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,880
and their students

1617
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,880
this application was created.

1618
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,880
The way the students

1619
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
visualized the data

1620
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,880
inspired them and then

1621
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,880
they published it.

1622
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
What I wanted to say before

1623
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
is that crowdsourcing,

1624
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
the DGA,

1625
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,880
is a tax altruism.

1626
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
What is it?

1627
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,880
It's about

1628
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,880
setting up organizations

1629
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,880
for tax altruism

1630
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,880
that will be intermediaries

1631
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
between the researchers,

1632
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
like Mateuž,

1633
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,880
and the citizens,

1634
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
if they want to share

1635
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
their personal data.

1636
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,880
Their story is about COVID.

1637
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
Robert Cook Institute

1638
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
had a problem because

1639
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
they wanted to set up

1640
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,880
a COVID lab

1641
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
and they wanted to raise

1642
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,880
the temperature of the individual

1643
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,880
from the brain.

1644
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
They wanted to make it simple.

1645
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
If you have, let's say,

1646
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
5,000 stars,

1647
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
or 20,000 people,

1648
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
you need 20,000 agreements

1649
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
on GDPR,

1650
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
and Mateuž won't bother

1651
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
with that.

1652
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
He will say,

1653
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,880
I don't have time, I don't care.

1654
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Here are the organizations

1655
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
for tax altruism

1656
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,880
that will collect

1657
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,880
all the agreements

1658
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,880
between the researchers.

1659
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
If we pay these organizations,

1660
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
it can't be a profitable organization,

1661
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,880
it has to be non-profitable,

1662
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,880
but we will find a way

1663
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
to pay them.

1664
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
There will be a project

1665
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,880
and we will find a way

1666
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
to pay them.

1667
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,880
We are always talking about

1668
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,880
anonymized data.

1669
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,880
The final phases are not interesting

1670
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
for the individuals,

1671
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
but for the trends.

1672
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,880
You can collect the data,

1673
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
extract it, and then anonymize it.

1674
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
Here we are talking about

1675
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,880
tax altruism.

1676
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,880
It has to be non-profitable.

1677
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
I thought about it

1678
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
as a problem.

1679
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
If they are non-profitable,

1680
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,880
they don't have money

1681
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,880
to set up an infrastructure.

1682
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,880
It would make sense

1683
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,880
to have a company

1684
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,880
that notifies

1685
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,880
the organizations

1686
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
about it.

1687
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
It's hard to tell

1688
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
Transparency International

1689
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,880
to set up an infrastructure

1690
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,880
and not have money to set it up.

1691
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,880
If an organization says

1692
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,880
pay as you go,

1693
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
and it has a researcher...

1694
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
What we do with a bunch

1695
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,880
of data on different projects

1696
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
is basically that.

1697
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,880
We go to the agency

1698
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
and tell them

1699
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,880
we will collect the data,

1700
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
I think this part

1701
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,880
can be treated

1702
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,880
as a non-profit organization

1703
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
that already has

1704
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,880
an infrastructure.

1705
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
You can't go to someone

1706
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,880
who has already

1707
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
set up

1708
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,880
an infrastructure

1709
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
and set it up.

1710
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
It's not a big deal.

1711
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,880
We can set up a thousand

1712
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,880
APIXS gateways and do it.

1713
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
I think it's

1714
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,880
phenomenally good.

1715
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
If we look back 10 years

1716
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,880
when we were talking about

1717
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,880
NCSV,

1718
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,880
it was a huge step.

1719
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,880
We were collecting

1720
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,880
a lot of data,

1721
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,880
we were doing a lot of things,

1722
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
and now we are talking about

1723
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
how far we have come.

1724
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,880
But in the end,

1725
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,880
if you don't hack

1726
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,880
and a bunch of people

1727
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
in the network,

1728
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,880
I don't know how many people

1729
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
on your Discord are hacking

1730
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,880
so we can calculate something.

1731
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,880
I think someone wrote

1732
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880
on Twitter,

1733
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,880
the agency has 60 people

1734
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
and they haven't managed

1735
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
to get one calculator up

1736
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,880
if they have already

1737
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,880
submitted the proposal.

1738
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
This is the collective

1739
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
irresponsibility,

1740
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,880
let everything be accepted,

1741
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,880
let everything be negotiated.

1742
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
And in the end,

1743
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
it's just data.

1744
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,880
It's up to you and the people

1745
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,880
to change something.

1746
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,880
This is the bright side of it.

1747
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
I think it's phenomenally good

1748
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,880
to look at the legal aspect,

1749
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,880
but on the other hand,

1750
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,880
you need people to hack it,

1751
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,880
and on the other hand,

1752
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,880
you need Vršič, Lenko and others

1753
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,880
at the ministry to support the process.

1754
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880
First, they could say

1755
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880
it's not my job,

1756
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,880
but no,

1757
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,880
I live to take one step further,

1758
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
to do my best

1759
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
in my job.

1760
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,880
That's why I like

1761
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
working with them.

1762
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,880
I don't have the feeling

1763
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
that they will accept me

1764
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,880
to die because I came

1765
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,880
to talk to them and wash

1766
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,880
some legal grounds and act

1767
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
as if nothing is allowed.

1768
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
I'm not talking about you specifically,

1769
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
but for a large agency,

1770
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,880
we have 5-6 thousand members.

1771
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,880
We are like a corporation.

1772
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Everyone forgets that

1773
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,880
the government of the Republic of Slovenia

1774
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,880
with all the ministries,

1775
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
etc.,

1776
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
is about 30,000 people

1777
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,880
in one police force.

1778
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,880
It's a corporation.

1779
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
Microsoft,

1780
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
I don't know,

1781
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
I think it's a similar story.

1782
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
It looks like a corporation.

1783
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,880
You have to sign something

1784
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,880
so that the situation

1785
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,880
doesn't get worse.

1786
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,880
You will always be alone

1787
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,880
and you will say,

1788
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
I don't have time,

1789
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
I won't do it,

1790
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,880
I'm afraid.

1791
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
With the support of data,

1792
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,880
I remember when I was

1793
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,880
a student in London

1794
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,880
at the Open Data Institute,

1795
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,880
there were 10 rules.

1796
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
A classic explanation

1797
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
of why not to open the data.

1798
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,880
The data will be found inside the package.

1799
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,880
So what?

1800
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
You will help to export it.

1801
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
It will be worth it.

1802
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
If we look at the data

1803
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,880
from Mravoloj,

1804
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,880
it is created

1805
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,880
when you pay a tax.

1806
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,880
When you pay registration.

1807
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
Part of that money

1808
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,880
also goes to the data.

1809
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,880
The data is already paid

1810
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,880
by the government.

1811
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
You always have to look

1812
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,880
at the data.

1813
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,880
I will ask you now.

1814
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,880
You have two or three projects

1815
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,880
as an autologist.

1816
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,880
A lot.

1817
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,880
I would call it

1818
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
IPAS.

1819
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,880
IPAS is

1820
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,880
a state entity.

1821
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,880
The state is the owner.

1822
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
I go inside,

1823
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,880
I see the data for my company.

1824
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,880
Then the key is written

1825
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
and you say

1826
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
sorry, this will be 350 euros per year.

1827
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,880
Is it

1828
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,880
actually the same

1829
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,880
with open data?

1830
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,880
They publish part of the data

1831
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,880
on the OPSI portal.

1832
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
They publish it

1833
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
once a month

1834
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,880
and refresh the data on OPSI.

1835
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,880
I have to say something.

1836
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
IPAS is

1837
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
a state

1838
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
entity.

1839
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,880
The problem is

1840
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
that half of the money

1841
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
has to be invested in the market.

1842
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,880
We get 100% of the money

1843
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
and we do what we want with it.

1844
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,880
IPAS has to invest

1845
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
part of the money in the market.

1846
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,880
We have a good relationship

1847
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,880
with them.

1848
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,880
They are very prepared

1849
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,880
and cooperative.

1850
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,880
They have to know their limits.

1851
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
As we said,

1852
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Slovenia

1853
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,880
has access to the data

1854
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
and we are in a position

1855
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,880
where IPAS is one of the best in Europe.

1856
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
For example,

1857
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
in Italy, you have to pay

1858
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
for every change.

1859
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,880
I don't know how it is

1860
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,880
with the change of the owner.

1861
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,880
Actually,

1862
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,880
all the effort

1863
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
is in the money

1864
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,880
that they get.

1865
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,880
I agree with what

1866
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
Otto wanted to say.

1867
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,880
As a company,

1868
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
you pay for the data

1869
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
and as an individual

1870
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,880
you pay for the data.

1871
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
We have to decide

1872
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,880
which side we will count on.

1873
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,880
No worries,

1874
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,880
but not on both sides.

1875
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,880
A company pays 35-40 euros

1876
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
for the data every year.

1877
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880
Cool.

1878
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,880
But you can't count

1879
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,880
for the same data

1880
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
that someone paid you

1881
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,880
to send you the data.

1882
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,880
I think it's a bit problematic.

1883
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
I think it's easier

1884
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,880
to see the business model

1885
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
in the eyes of an autologist

1886
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,880
than in the eyes of an individual

1887
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,880
who has to come to the market.

1888
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,880
Yes, but not on both sides.

1889
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,880
The decision is made for one

1890
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,880
and that's it.

1891
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
I think it's problematic.

1892
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
Why is the IPAS

1893
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,880
like this?

1894
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
Why isn't it always like this?

1895
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,880
Because it's always 100%

1896
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,880
paid by the state.

1897
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,880
But why is the IPAS not like this?

1898
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,880
It's something

1899
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,880
that everyone thinks about.

1900
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,880
Will we pay 2 million for this?

1901
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,880
We pay for a lot of other things

1902
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,880
or whatever they need.

1903
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
Let's cover this up

1904
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,880
and give them all the data.

1905
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,880
But it's not like a company

1906
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,880
has to pay 35 euros.

1907
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
If we count how many companies

1908
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,880
there are in Slovenia

1909
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,880
on the one hand

1910
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,880
it's not that small,

1911
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
but on the other hand

1912
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
it's not that big.

1913
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,880
We're not in a huge market

1914
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,880
that wouldn't be profitable.

1915
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,880
And I agree with this.

1916
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,880
These 9.5 million

1917
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,880
because of the agencies

1918
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,880
where there are some

1919
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,880
legal violations

1920
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
on the basis of which

1921
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,880
we operate.

1922
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,880
That needs to be streamlined.

1923
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,880
I repeat,

1924
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,880
in my field,

1925
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
especially in operating systems

1926
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,880
and other things,

1927
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
why is it because of legacy?

1928
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,880
Someone wrote something

1929
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
in 1965.

1930
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
We've always done it that way.

1931
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,880
And it stays that way.

1932
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,880
Let's ask ourselves

1933
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
if it's really necessary.

1934
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,880
We operate in a set of things

1935
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
where the rubber duck programming

1936
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,880
would help us.

1937
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,880
It's not about the rules.

1938
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,880
They probably aren't.

1939
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,880
It's the same here.

1940
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,880
It's a daily question.

1941
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
Why do they work?

1942
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,880
We look at the data

1943
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,880
and we know they worked hard.

1944
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
I remember the PRS

1945
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,880
that was published.

1946
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,880
It was without HSMID.

1947
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,880
We take the HSI.

1948
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,880
We sent it to them

1949
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,880
and they did it.

1950
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,880
We knew they had the data.

1951
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,880
The value of the data is

1952
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,880
that you can connect

1953
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,880
the business register of subjects

1954
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
to the data of the law

1955
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,880
and place all the subjects in the space.

1956
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,880
Then you can work in analytics.

1957
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
We have a new story

1958
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,880
about the number of employees

1959
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,880
in companies.

1960
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
There was a team

1961
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,880
that was asked

1962
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,880
where to get the data

1963
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,880
on the number of employees

1964
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,880
in a company.

1965
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,880
We asked them

1966
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,880
if they had it.

1967
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Who could have it?

1968
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,880
Statistics?

1969
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Maybe they had it.

1970
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
In this country,

1971
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
there is no system

1972
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,880
to collect data on the number of employees.

1973
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,880
It's one of the things

1974
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,880
we are discussing.

1975
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,880
We would like to try

1976
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,880
the data.

1977
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,880
The more data there is,

1978
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,880
the more interesting it is.

1979
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
If you are in marketing,

1980
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
you will attract data

1981
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
that has more than 50 employees.

1982
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,880
You will mistreat

1983
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,880
all the smaller data

1984
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
that may not be relevant.

1985
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,880
This is the pleasure

1986
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,880
of data,

1987
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,880
the added value

1988
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,880
that you can give

1989
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,880
to the data

1990
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,880
with just one attribute.

1991
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,880
It's like a geospatial component.

1992
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,880
We had the last

1993
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,880
talk about data spaces.

1994
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,880
If you have a TV for everyone,

1995
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,880
they create a thing

1996
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,880
with x and y coordinates.

1997
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,880
A statistician

1998
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,880
has a grid.

1999
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,880
They can connect

2000
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,880
most of their data

2001
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,880
to this grid.

2002
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
They can also get

2003
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,880
statistical data

2004
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,880
that is not related

2005
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,880
to the population.

2006
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,880
For this grid,

2007
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,880
they have an application

2008
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,880
called Stage,

2009
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
where you can download

2010
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,880
data on this network.

2011
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,880
The smallest cell

2012
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,880
is 100 km,

2013
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
which is very thin data

2014
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,880
that you can get

2015
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,880
for 100 km.

2016
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,880
You can scale up

2017
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
up to 50 km.

2018
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
It's part of the European network.

2019
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,880
It doesn't stop at Slovenian borders.

2020
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,880
You can get this data

2021
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
with minimal

2022
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,880
changes

2023
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,880
and additions.

2024
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,880
You can scale up

2025
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,880
to the maximum.

2026
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
You're well-dressed.

2027
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,880
I have short sleeves.

2028
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,880
I'm sorry.

2029
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,880
I have a T-shirt

2030
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,880
in my chest.

2031
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,880
We didn't get it.

2032
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,880
Sorry.

2033
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,880
It's a test.

2034
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,880
It's easy.

2035
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,880
I'm a Slovenian.

2036
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
You need a T-shirt.

2037
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,880
I need a hoodie.

2038
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
You need a hoodie.

2039
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,880
We made it

2040
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,880
from a prototype batch

2041
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,880
to see what material it is.

2042
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,880
We have a sticker.

2043
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,880
I want to call

2044
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,880
our listeners

2045
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,880
and viewers to join us

2046
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,880
on Discord.

2047
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,880
If they like it in Grodno,

2048
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,880
to support us on Patreon

2049
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,880
so we can make stories of this quality.

2050
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,880
I also want to thank

2051
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,880
Human Frog and

2052
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
Trifles for their support.

2053
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,880
I hope

2054
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,880
our viewers and listeners

2055
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,880
enjoy it and give you feedback

2056
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,880
so we can keep building.

2057
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
That's the EPP

2058
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,880
I have to say.

2059
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
I would like to ask

2060
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,880
because

2061
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,880
people will ask me

2062
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,880
intentionally, but where is

2063
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
the open source

2064
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,880
component?

2065
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Where do you think

2066
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,880
the community

2067
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,880
can help you the most?

2068
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
Create

2069
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,880
use cases,

2070
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,880
create products.

2071
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,880
Where do you see

2072
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,880
the biggest opportunity?

2073
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,880
Where do you see open source

2074
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,880
and how important is it?

2075
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,880
First of all,

2076
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,880
what we are trying to do

2077
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,880
is to try to push

2078
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,880
the data forward.

2079
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,880
We are not focusing on

2080
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,880
creating a product.

2081
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,880
This product will be obsolete

2082
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,880
in 5 years.

2083
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,880
If you can build it

2084
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,880
as high as you can with data,

2085
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,880
then you can come

2086
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,880
and have it on the web

2087
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,880
in 2 weeks.

2088
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,880
We are a developer

2089
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,880
with 1 million users.

2090
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,880
We did it in 2 weeks

2091
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,880
and we still have 10, 20, 30...

2092
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,880
How much data do you pay for 1 million?

2093
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,880
That's true.

2094
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,880
We have to bury the data.

2095
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
You know, a hundred other people could come in and take the data,

2096
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
as much as we have for accuracy and other things,

2097
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
and make their own product.

2098
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I don't care. Thank God.

2099
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And if I just put my product out there and say,

2100
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
this is my product, and encapsulate it in that product,

2101
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I've basically already failed.

2102
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
It's much more important to me to put the data out there,

2103
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
and have a sense of whether it's closed source or open source,

2104
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
so that everyone can make something of their own in two weeks.

2105
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And I was really happy about it,

2106
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
when I said, we're going to open source this,

2107
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
and then we're going to look at whether we're going to change anything

2108
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
in the community or not.

2109
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Make your own. I don't care.

2110
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
We're not going to go around looking at it in a circle.

2111
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Do it. But here you have the data,

2112
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
and you can do whatever you want with it,

2113
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and as long as you don't break anything for me,

2114
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
because I don't have to prepare the service,

2115
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
then use it.

2116
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And that's why I call it open source,

2117
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
because I see it as open source data,

2118
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
more like open source of some products,

2119
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
where you say, oh, I use that product.

2120
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I don't know, for Autolock, I don't know,

2121
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
maybe I used 50 hours with clean data,

2122
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I set up infrastructure and everything,

2123
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
or maybe 100, I don't know,

2124
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
because we drank a lot of coffee,

2125
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and we were drunk with the view,

2126
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
when the guys were doing it.

2127
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Honestly, is it really that fully valuable now,

2128
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
that I would say,

2129
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
no one in the world can do it in hundreds,

2130
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
or in hundreds, or in thousands of hours?

2131
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Yes, exactly.

2132
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
But you can, do it.

2133
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Don't worry about it.

2134
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Is it really that important,

2135
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
that it's an open source product?

2136
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
No, because it has a hood value.

2137
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It's not rocket science to do that.

2138
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The fact that you can use that data,

2139
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
because we set it up in the app,

2140
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and normalized the data from different providers,

2141
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
and said, look, here you have data

2142
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
about all the possible transports,

2143
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
here you have an OTP server,

2144
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
which does multimodal transport,

2145
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
and you can pick up bikes and cars,

2146
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and walk, and everything,

2147
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
and you can say, ok, I'm interested

2148
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
in ecological sustainability,

2149
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
or sustainability, or whatever,

2150
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
and you do it according to your priorities.

2151
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Basically, I think it's really important,

2152
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
that I give you this part,

2153
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
maybe we can call it a product,

2154
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
to the extent that you say,

2155
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
hey, cool, I have an app,

2156
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
which is focused on this specific aspect,

2157
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
which I want to develop as a final product,

2158
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
and I don't have to deal with the fact

2159
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
that I have to make a policy on them,

2160
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
and shoot, and all that,

2161
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I will do it for you.

2162
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
You deal with the product,

2163
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
and it's open source because of me.

2164
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So you're more of an infrastructure provider?

2165
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Yes, let's put it that way.

2166
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
We open source data through infrastructure.

2167
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And you're a data intermediary?

2168
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yes, yes, I didn't know I was that

2169
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
until I heard it today.

2170
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
If you notify yourself,

2171
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
then you can use this logo.

2172
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Aha!

2173
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I wanted to say something before,

2174
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
but...

2175
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Oh, cool, in four to six months.

2176
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
No, no, no.

2177
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
How long did we need for Zvob 2?

2178
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
No, no, no, this will go

2179
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
in February,

2180
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
the Slovenian implementation

2181
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
of the European order will go

2182
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
in February in public defense,

2183
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
where we will also be active.

2184
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
We have to look at Aleš,

2185
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
he's an eternal optimist,

2186
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
he talked to me about Zvob 2 for years,

2187
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
but we won't talk about Zvob 2 now.

2188
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
We can help together.

2189
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
For example, we have the option

2190
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
to publish applications

2191
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
that have been developed,

2192
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
as soon as the application is published,

2193
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
you can scroll and say,

2194
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
ok, I used these options,

2195
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
so we know where they were used.

2196
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
That would help us a lot,

2197
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
because at the moment,

2198
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
we have the biggest difficulty

2199
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
in assessing the commission

2200
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
because we have social,

2201
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
economic,

2202
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
environmental,

2203
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
and governmental impacts.

2204
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
What are the effects

2205
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
when you re-use the data,

2206
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
if someone did something,

2207
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
or what he did,

2208
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
a social, environmental,

2209
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
or economic effect,

2210
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
it would help us a lot

2211
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
to know about these examples.

2212
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
If you say,

2213
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
this and that didn't happen

2214
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
in Slovenia because of the data.

2215
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
This feedback,

2216
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I would say,

2217
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
is a threat to the data,

2218
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
because someone could

2219
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
give us an application,

2220
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
but if it's very hostile,

2221
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
where is the application,

2222
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
can you leave it?

2223
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
The problem is that you want

2224
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
to re-experience as soon as possible,

2225
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and if you give it a chance,

2226
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I would also like to say

2227
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
that there are no applications in other countries.

2228
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
What you have,

2229
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
where the data is,

2230
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
you can do whatever you want with it.

2231
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I have to thank,

2232
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I don't know if it's enough to say,

2233
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
the developers,

2234
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Marko Kudor,

2235
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
from the XLAB company,

2236
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
we have been working with them

2237
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
for many years,

2238
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
and it has always been a pleasure

2239
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
to work with them.

2240
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Marko managed to realize

2241
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
all our wishes very quickly,

2242
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
and we are very satisfied

2243
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
with the cooperation,

2244
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
because everything is going

2245
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
very quickly,

2246
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and we will do what we need to do.

2247
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It is also thanks to him

2248
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
that the portal is in the form

2249
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
it is now,

2250
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
and here I would like

2251
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
to call together

2252
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
to publish our feedback

2253
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
based on the applications

2254
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
that have been created.

2255
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
If there are any studies,

2256
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
or documents,

2257
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
you can write to us.

2258
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I will put the links in the description.

2259
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
So that we know

2260
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
what it is all about.

2261
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So that you know who used it,

2262
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and why.

2263
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Because it seems to me that in Slovenia

2264
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
it is quite difficult to do something

2265
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
on the night of a zombie attack.

2266
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
At the end,

2267
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Autolock has 13,000 active devices

2268
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
where Autolock

2269
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
does the job of opening

2270
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
the web view of the website.

2271
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Because it turned out that people

2272
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
have a lot of trouble registering

2273
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
those 17 digits.

2274
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Very quickly, as you can see,

2275
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
a couple of these apps

2276
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
have a relatively large impact in Slovenia.

2277
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
A lot of them are

2278
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
latent applications.

2279
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Autolock itself is there,

2280
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
but what does it mean

2281
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
if someone uses this data

2282
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and how does it improve the process?

2283
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I don't think we can get that feedback.

2284
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You can turn it off,

2285
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
and they will probably tell you.

2286
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
We had an example of that.

2287
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
An anecdote for the community.

2288
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
One is related to Autolock.

2289
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
When a child

2290
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
was driving in Aže,

2291
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
they were surprised

2292
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
that the data was available

2293
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
on the first or second day of the month.

2294
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And if they didn't have it,

2295
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
the whole drama.

2296
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Because their business models

2297
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
were so normal.

2298
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
They saw what the competition was doing,

2299
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and they said, we need to strengthen the company,

2300
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
because you have this data.

2301
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Most of it was for daily registration,

2302
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
for the numbers to be printed.

2303
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
It's not about that.

2304
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You can get the data from the municipalities.

2305
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
You can see how many BMWs were sold

2306
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
in a municipality last month.

2307
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And how many buyers and shareholders

2308
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
were there.

2309
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
It's an interesting collection.

2310
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Another thing that shocked us

2311
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
was the register of pharmaceutical products.

2312
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
It was hard to buy.

2313
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It wasn't public.

2314
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
But when it was,

2315
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Marina managed to send them

2316
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
to some Excel or CSV.

2317
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And it had 300 pages.

2318
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
But besides that,

2319
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
if you don't get the latest version,

2320
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and if there's no product

2321
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
that would sell it,

2322
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
you know you can't sell it.

2323
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And it's for a small company.

2324
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
In some municipalities,

2325
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it's a huge scale.

2326
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
You can have 10 data in Slovenia,

2327
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
and without any evidence,

2328
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
which is basic for their business,

2329
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
if it's not updated...

2330
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
You can go to the process.

2331
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's only for 10 data,

2332
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
because it doesn't mean anything.

2333
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It's not just about them.

2334
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It's about the impact.

2335
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
In some municipalities,

2336
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
one small collection

2337
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
of pharmaceutical products is a big deal.

2338
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
But in some municipalities,

2339
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
you can't sell it,

2340
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
because it's not registered.

2341
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Here, the stories are interesting.

2342
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
But when you have the impact,

2343
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
you calculate the impact

2344
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
for the app.

2345
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
They give you feedback.

2346
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Then you can start hacking.

2347
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Yes, yes.

2348
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
You have weird laws.

2349
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Here we have a hacker

2350
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
for the network.

2351
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Then you sell the data back.

2352
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's like you're feeding us

2353
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
weird laws to bypass it.

2354
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
When they changed the electricity,

2355
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
the agency...

2356
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
One of the requirements

2357
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
was the efficiency of the data.

2358
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I think it said

2359
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
that the data must be updated.

2360
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I was shocked by that.

2361
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Electro-disposal?

2362
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Yes.

2363
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
One of the KPIs was

2364
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
whether the data is updated or not.

2365
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
In the past, it was very difficult

2366
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
to talk to municipalities.

2367
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
There weren't that many people.

2368
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Until we had a plan

2369
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
for a smart city,

2370
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
which was already unsuccessful.

2371
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
But the consequence

2372
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
of that plan was

2373
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
that municipalities started

2374
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
uploading data to the municipality.

2375
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
One of the criteria

2376
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
was to re-use their own collection.

2377
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
There was some...

2378
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
There's interest.

2379
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's like a prototype

2380
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
of a human rights model

2381
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
that has a goal

2382
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
to change something

2383
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
for the better.

2384
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But there's a problem.

2385
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
We, as Free,

2386
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
work a lot.

2387
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We don't do these projects

2388
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
in a financially beneficial way,

2389
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
but we do them

2390
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
because we can make

2391
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
a big impact.

2392
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It was a very

2393
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
sweet spot.

2394
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yes, that's right.

2395
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
This collaboration

2396
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and our connection

2397
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
works so well

2398
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
because we're all complementary

2399
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and we can give each other...

2400
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Aleš needs apps. We're working on them.

2401
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
We need Aleš to help us

2402
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
because we could legally get

2403
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
everything.

2404
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
One is on paper, the other is in practice.

2405
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And then you have people

2406
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
who are actively involved with you.

2407
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
It's a bit of a legal thing.

2408
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Maybe, as Mateš said,

2409
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
we're all connected.

2410
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We started a project

2411
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
together with OECD.

2412
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
We set up a network of data stewards

2413
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
in English.

2414
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
In Slovenian it's called

2415
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
skrbnik.

2416
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
These would be individuals

2417
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
at institutions who would be

2418
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
in contact with each other for all the data.

2419
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Not just for the open data,

2420
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
but data from the institution

2421
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
and try to set up

2422
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
internal procedures

2423
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
such as quality control.

2424
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
We haven't reached that yet.

2425
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
We're working with Mateuš

2426
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
on the methodology

2427
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
of quality of public data.

2428
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Because it is what it is.

2429
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Now we have to take it to the next level

2430
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
by raising the quality.

2431
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Because we know that data

2432
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
can be excellent for one purpose,

2433
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and completely crap for another.

2434
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And the quality...

2435
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Interoperability.

2436
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
That connectivity.

2437
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Someone gives you a password,

2438
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and the other one doesn't,

2439
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and then you do a matching.

2440
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
We're also looking at

2441
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
trying out some things,

2442
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
recommendations.

2443
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
To be able to connect things.

2444
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
To automate them to a certain extent.

2445
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Some things, for example,

2446
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
can be automated relatively easily.

2447
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
To see if consistency exists,

2448
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
to be able to stick it

2449
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
to the same scheme.

2450
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
One more thing.

2451
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
If we talk to each other,

2452
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
the network is like a forum.

2453
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
The individual is currently represented

2454
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
as a team of 30 state institutions.

2455
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
As soon as you realize

2456
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
that you're not the only one with these problems,

2457
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
that we all have them,

2458
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
then you start solving these problems

2459
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
together.

2460
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I have to say

2461
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
that I'm very proud of the individuals

2462
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
in this group

2463
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
who want to change something.

2464
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Who are promoters of good solutions.

2465
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
For example, a member of the state

2466
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
has a payment system

2467
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
that can change data.

2468
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
In the decision of the CSD

2469
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
on data transfer,

2470
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
the data is transferred via a payment.

2471
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Payment of data from 47 different

2472
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
data centers.

2473
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
They send them to the CSD

2474
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
and they make a decision.

2475
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Another thing,

2476
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
international driver's license.

2477
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Through the payment,

2478
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
they receive data

2479
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
about the condition of the vehicle.

2480
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Can you drive a car or not?

2481
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Can you transfer alcohol inside?

2482
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
When the documents were on paper,

2483
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
it was written

2484
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
to transfer the vehicle.

2485
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
When we came to plastic,

2486
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
there was no such thing.

2487
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
There was a problem

2488
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
with the international driver's license.

2489
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Then the state took the time

2490
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
to make a decision

2491
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
and they confirmed that

2492
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
there was no problem.

2493
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But you had to come to the CSD.

2494
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
If you were late,

2495
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the CSD didn't work anymore.

2496
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Until the moment when the CSD

2497
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
said it,

2498
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
data was transferred via payment.

2499
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You come to the CSD

2500
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
and you get the international driver's license

2501
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
without any problems.

2502
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
These are small use cases.

2503
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Because of the payment,

2504
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
we have a lot of cases

2505
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
where the state can

2506
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
make these problems.

2507
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Maybe it's not political will.

2508
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I don't know if it's political.

2509
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Maybe it's misunderstanding.

2510
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
The state already has all your data,

2511
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
but you still fill in some spaces.

2512
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
It's a very ungrateful question.

2513
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But

2514
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
there is a lot of power

2515
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
when you decide

2516
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
or when you start

2517
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
that someone will decide

2518
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
to give the CSD up there

2519
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
or to hire a CEO.

2520
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You have to portray people.

2521
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
It's a lot of work

2522
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
and energy.

2523
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
People want to hear

2524
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
and they will see it as additional work.

2525
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
They will see it as something

2526
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
that will help them.

2527
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
We are trying to do that.

2528
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
We are trying to do that.

2529
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
We are trying to do that

2530
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
with Excel.

2531
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
If you upload Excel on Ops,

2532
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
there is a possibility

2533
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
that it will be uploaded.

2534
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
If I remember correctly,

2535
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
we haven't used it yet.

2536
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
We haven't used it yet.

2537
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It's been a year.

2538
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It's been a year.

2539
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It's been a year.

2540
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It's been a year.

2541
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
It's been a year.

2542
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It's been a year.

2543
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
If I remember correctly,

2544
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
the people who were hired,

2545
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
there were no data stewards,

2546
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
but there were data collectors

2547
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
who collected the basic data.

2548
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It was like the 20th task

2549
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
of someone.

2550
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
It was like the 20th task of someone.

2551
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
There was an attitude

2552
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
of how we implemented it.

2553
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
It was so broken.

2554
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You have 35 things to do,

2555
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
then someone will tell you

2556
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
that you will have to delete

2557
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
some of the data.

2558
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Then they will come to you

2559
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and ask for the data.

2560
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
You don't know how to export it.

2561
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Then they will ask you to do it again.

2562
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Then they will ask you to do it again.

2563
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Then they will ask you to do it again.

2564
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
In the 10th year,

2565
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
the attitude changed.

2566
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
People started to have

2567
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
one more task.

2568
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
There is a legal basis

2569
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
on which we have to do it.

2570
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
The idea of the data stewards

2571
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
was to make it full-time

2572
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
where you would have a lot of data.

2573
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
But the process...

2574
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I was so surprised

2575
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
when we started this project.

2576
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I thought that if we would have

2577
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
10 data stewards from the state,

2578
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
it would be like that.

2579
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
When we sent a message to the minister

2580
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
to propose it to him,

2581
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
he got angry and said

2582
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
end number 33.

2583
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I was like wow.

2584
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
The profiles are different.

2585
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
It is a novelty.

2586
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Slovenia is one of the first countries

2587
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
in the world that systematically

2588
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
implements this function in the institution.

2589
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Estonia,

2590
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
maybe Ireland,

2591
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
then America.

2592
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Let's be honest.

2593
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
What we are talking about now

2594
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
will be something that we will need

2595
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
every day in the next 10 years.

2596
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Like we are talking about some situations

2597
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
where we have been working for 10 years

2598
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and we haven't sent any APIX.

2599
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I hope that we have sent them

2600
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
a lot of data because of me.

2601
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
If you are interested in the futuristic part,

2602
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
we will get used to the luxury

2603
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
of how to get this data,

2604
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
what access we have,

2605
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
to whom we have access,

2606
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
who we can communicate with.

2607
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
That is the beauty of it.

2608
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
If I look at it now,

2609
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
we have been working like this

2610
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
for the last 10 plus years.

2611
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
A lot of things have gone forward.

2612
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
We have succeeded in a lot of things.

2613
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
At the same time,

2614
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I, Aleš and others at the ministry

2615
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
have a feeling that we are fighting

2616
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
but we have succeeded in everything

2617
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
and that is what we are fighting for.

2618
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Now the manager is talking shit.

2619
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
We will try to get through

2620
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
to the end.

2621
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I would like to ask

2622
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
what is the holy grail

2623
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
that you want to see in the datasets?

2624
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
What is the data source

2625
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
or something

2626
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
that you would like to have

2627
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
in the same collection

2628
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
or what do you want?

2629
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Is it some IoT data

2630
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
or some high frequency data?

2631
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I know.

2632
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
He sent us a list.

2633
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
The more data,

2634
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
the more good stories

2635
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
we can make out of it.

2636
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
When you think about it,

2637
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
if Mateuš

2638
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
from the data,

2639
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
which is primarily

2640
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
registered vehicles,

2641
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
would have done

2642
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
an auto log.

2643
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Wow!

2644
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
As many stories as possible,

2645
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I would like

2646
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
the value

2647
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
of data

2648
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
to come to life.

2649
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
At this point,

2650
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I would like you to welcome us

2651
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
because the first week of March

2652
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
is the World Data Day.

2653
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
We will have a campaign

2654
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
so welcome us.

2655
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Thank you.

2656
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
As you mentioned the auto log,

2657
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I have the best feeling

2658
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
in the world

2659
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
when you take some data

2660
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
and make a product

2661
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
that people thought

2662
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
it was impossible to do.

2663
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
There is no problem

2664
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
because you don't know

2665
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
if you can do it.

2666
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
For example,

2667
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
we don't have the data.

2668
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
We have one, two, three

2669
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
very good ideas.

2670
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
If you want to listen to them,

2671
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
we will post them on the OPS portal.

2672
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
If we get coffee.

2673
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
We understand Aleš's position.

2674
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
We have to support him

2675
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
by giving him such things

2676
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and promoting them.

2677
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
But at this moment,

2678
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
the amount of data

2679
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
we have,

2680
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
is to a certain extent,

2681
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
but maybe not as much

2682
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
as it is

2683
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
in specific industries.

2684
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
There is a lot of added value

2685
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
in a lot of different aspects

2686
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
of the data.

2687
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
The more,

2688
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
the more awesome.

2689
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I would add

2690
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
to that,

2691
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I will give you a chance

2692
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
because I will not give up.

2693
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Good?

2694
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I think we have to do it again in 10 years.

2695
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
In 10 years?

2696
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
We have a few more projects,

2697
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
so you have to hear more.

2698
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
At this point,

2699
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I would like to thank you

2700
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
for your time.

2701
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Thank you for listening.

2702
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I hope you will continue

2703
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
with us this year.

2704
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Thank you to the team,

2705
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
to the supporters.

2706
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Thank you.
