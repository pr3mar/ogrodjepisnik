00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to the third season, the third episode in Grodje, it's a little different, I kept it a little longer, it's still in Grodje,

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but today there's no car here, today there's a car in the back, where are you car? We can't see you.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He's drinking beer.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's why we have such an interesting guest with me today in this conversation, I hope we'll have a lot of conversations,

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
with me Ivan Popelnjak, Jan Žorš.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I've had a lot of trouble with how to introduce myself here, but if I say so, Siva Eminence.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Old fart.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, here I think sometimes old, but overcast, experienced.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm old.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Poisoned.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Before retirement.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I wouldn't say that.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Poisoned producers.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's put it another way, Poisoned from Čes, and then we'll talk about what you're most poisoned with.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll try to introduce you quickly, and then you can add something.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Ivan, as a blogger, podcaster, creator, architect, what else did I forget?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Alright.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's what you've been talking about lately.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Lately I've been a programmer.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right, we'll get to that.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Jan, as a...

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Jan, yes.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Almost an evangelist.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A speaker.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know, in Slovenia, the ones that know you the most are the ones that push IPv6.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'd like to add a personal note here.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can say that I deserve that all operators get together and talk.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because I think that 15 or 20 years ago, there was no synergy between operators.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This culture has changed a lot.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Back then we did...

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When was that?

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We did it in 2006.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We did an IPv6 community, where operators came from all over the world.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I remember the first meetings we had.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They looked at each other, everyone was in their own corner.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Usually they talked to each other as guests.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then it became a community, an internet community,

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
which later transformed into SINOK, the Slovenian Network Operators Group.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think that now operators communicate with each other.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They've become friends.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I like it the most at meetings.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When I listen to that, I feel relaxed.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There were no rushes at the beginning.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think the culture has changed a lot.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
At the beginning, every country has its own knowledge,

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
but now they share it.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm glad that I can help here.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Cool.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's move on.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Today, I thought we would talk more about the depths of network engineering.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Is that the right term for this?

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Everything that is connected to the internet,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and I don't mean the human network,

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
but the connection between devices,

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
can be seen as someone who created it all,

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
if I can call it that.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The internet is what it is today.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you don't listen to it, express it,

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
talk to vendors...

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's something like that.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How do you call it? Internet guides?

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ideally, we are that.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I mean, complete networking, not just the internet.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's an infrastructure that is like a guide and an electrician.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you know that there is some kind of food.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, exactly.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The other problem is that no one knows about it yet.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
First of all, they thought that the laws of physics don't apply to them.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They live in a matrix and so on.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The second thing is that you have an electrical faculty.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We are talking about an electrical faculty.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Five years.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You have a fast current and a strong current.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
In the past, you had both automatic and all the rest.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And there is a person who has been studying for five years

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
how to drive a huge amount of electricity.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
At the Faculty of Computer Science, you have one year of networking.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And people who go to the station to buy a fan

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and plug it in at home,

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
they don't ask how the electricity came to them, right?

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Of course not.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Even a person who goes to the station to buy a fan

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
doesn't have to ask how the electricity came to him.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I want to say something.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
For a technology that is 200 years old,

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
graduates are represented in a special way

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But for a technology that is really only 40 or 50 years old,

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
we have one year of one subject at the Faculty of Computer Science.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Both technologies are equally important for today's life.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because if it's not for electricity, networking won't work.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If it's not for networking, then you know what will work.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, little or nothing.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nothing.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Games don't exist because you have to connect to a server

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
so that you can start playing straight away.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Something like that.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, that's a good conclusion.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, that's a good conclusion.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But how did the two of you get in here?

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What would you say is the most interesting thing in your career

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and how did you start working with it?

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You started it.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've been in front of you for 10 years now.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not 10, not 8 for sure.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know what's crazy and interesting?

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was around the time of 8-bit processors.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Delta Partners, if anyone remembers.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And they had serial ports in the back.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's like USB-C mobile for those who are a bit younger.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's USB-C got today?

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A lot.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We don't know.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, that's how we managed through our 30,000 bits per second.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then someone came up with a brilliant idea.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If we now fake a standard, which always happens in networking,

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and we connect a receiver and a transmitter to a diode,

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
we actually have a part of the base on which we can have more computers.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then he had this brilliant idea.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Once he tried it, he found me and said,

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
now we need to do something.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And that's how the network between partners was created.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They made it into a nice product,

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
with higher speed and a better interface.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So in the end it worked like a dream come true.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But what is it that drives you?

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The technology is what drives you, but still...

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You know what's interesting?

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That you manage to communicate with each other through different physical means.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You know, the main book is the main book.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It doesn't run on a computer for a long time.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How do machines communicate with each other?

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
For example, I remember back in the days of VAX,

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
maybe it was in 2002-2003,

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
when TCP stack was implemented.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
1992-1993.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You had Multinet and Deco stack.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Those VAXs that had Multinet could communicate with Linux machines,

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Deco stack could communicate with Linux machines,

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but they couldn't communicate with each other.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Those were interesting times.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I know that this was with IBM's AX,

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
because it used a different encapsulation on the Ethernet.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I haven't heard about those two yet.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I thought it was with them.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Was the TCP stack on VMS or on Ultrex?

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
On VMS.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I mean, I know that Multinet sold it.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I believe so.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We sold a lot of them.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But...

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go back in time.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If we take...

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
How do you see the Internet or the era

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
for today and in the future?

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where do you see the biggest revolutions that happened here?

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean, today we have a different planet.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But the basis is still the same.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Wait, I didn't mean that.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There were no revolutions.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Today we use the same protocols as we used 50 years ago.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Exactly.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The Ethernet framing is old.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think 50 years.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It went from 10 megabits to 400 gigabits.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
800 at least.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
800, 1600.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But I think 400 gigabits is already standardized.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes, it's already being sold in traffic.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's right.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
TCP, IP, where did the first RFCs for IP and TCP come from?

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TCP hasn't really changed.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, TCP got a few new bits.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Congestion avoidance is better now.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There are fewer bugs.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And IP...

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
IPv6 came instead.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It changed certain bugs.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes, it went further into the words.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It made certain things more complicated.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No, I don't think so.

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Every programmer would have to go back to The Mythical Man-Month.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a book written by a man who was a project manager for the IBM 370 operating system.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was for work.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It was crazy boring.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The scores were canceled, but then it got a bit more exciting.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And he explains to others that the first system you're going to make will always be for nothing.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's just a question of whether you can add it to the website or not.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We added the website to the website, and the consequences are here.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We're still holding on to that today.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, and we're still fighting spam.

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Just because some idiots said,

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
we're all friends and we won't account for e-mails and all that nonsense.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And we're still fighting spam because we have to pay our employees.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I mean, it all comes from the premise that we were all the best people on the internet in the beginning.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It all comes from the fact that although the transport network was created as a result of a project,

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the application was written on Berkeley.

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let's say.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And then you get this mythical man-month, right?

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then you finally get the budget to write this system anew.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And then comes the second system effect.

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Because you've learned what you've done before, and now you're going to fix everything and it's going to be different.

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And the second system is even worse than the first.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is IPv6.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And IETF.

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, IETF is...

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And then you have how to switch from IPv4 to IPv6.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You have transition mechanisms.

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And then you realize that you have 50 of them.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Transition mechanisms.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then someone comes and remembers that this is not right.

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's make a transition mechanism that will fit all 50 of them.

215
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then we have 51 transition mechanisms.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Which is much better than all the other 50.

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Exactly.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And look at the XKCD standards.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Right.

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now, I used to mess around with roses.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And then you realize that there are

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
10 different types,

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and subtypes of roses,

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
which practically no one has ever seen before.

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Because they are so similar.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And in the end, you come to the conclusion that

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
some kind of a species was created because someone needed a proof of origin.

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And some kind of technology in the Internet and IETF

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
was created because someone needed a patent or an IETF draft.

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No, in fact, it's still good for now.

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They are figuring out a problem so that they can solve it.

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Now we will...

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We lost some listener.

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We could take a step back and explain it.

236
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you want to go two kilometers back?

237
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What is IETF, what does it represent?

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Or...

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's put it another way.

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If we are talking about this child,

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
if we are talking about the Internet today,

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
who decides what?

243
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Who decides what?

244
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What are the rules?

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is the beauty of the Internet.

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
First of all,

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
first of all,

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
no one has their hands crossed.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay, DNA, SKIS, and so on.

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But let's leave it at that.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But in fact,

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Internet technologies are one of the rare standards

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
where the standard is created in the public.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because we think it's good.

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's great.

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's the only truth.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
In fact, all other standard organizations

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
dealing with telecommunications

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
live off the sale of paper.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And you have ITU,

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
which is a representative of the state.

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And there, representatives of the state

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
vote on anything.

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I think it's wonderful.

265
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And how do they know about telecommunications?

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They send their employees.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Telephone companies, really.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And X25.

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And X400.

270
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All of this is no longer for good reasons,

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
just for those of you who don't know what we're talking about.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There is evidence of what they are capable of doing.

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think the last cry they managed to make was ASDN,

274
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and then it died over time.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It won't heal over time.

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now they will standardize the Internet.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Next generation Internet.

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Because it's not good.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's all get together,

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and make something new.

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Something similar to telecommunications.

282
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Should we get together,

283
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
or should we just launch something new,

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and hope that everyone will migrate to something new?

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll tell you a story from 2012.

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I started working at the Internet Society,

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and there was a plenipotentiary meeting in Dubai,

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
from ITU.

289
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And I got lessons,

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
some proposals from some countries.

291
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I was looking at the flyer,

292
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think it was in Los Angeles,

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and I burst into laughter.

294
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And I think Algeria,

295
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
one of those countries,

296
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
proposed it.

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And we all saw how the IPv4 languages

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
were divided,

299
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
that underdeveloped countries

300
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
don't have enough IPv4 languages

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
to build the Internet,

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
because they all took away

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
those proud developments.

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Their decision was

305
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
to reclaim,

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
to take all IPv4 languages back

307
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
to one big pool.

308
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That means everyone has to go back,

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and deconfigure.

310
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And then they will divide them again,

311
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
according to the country,

312
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
not according to BGP,

313
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
but according to BDP,

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and according to the population,

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and so on.

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's how I started thinking about

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
how it will work.

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And then I realized

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that it's a great idea.

320
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's a beautiful idea.

321
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I really hoped

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that it would happen.

323
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Do you know how fast

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
IPv6 would be implemented?

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
At the moment,

326
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
the whole world would be on IPv6.

327
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In a few months, I think.

328
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's probably the part of engineering

329
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
where the deployment is very simple.

330
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes.

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's not very simple,

332
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
but it's manageable.

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
As long as you're starting

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
something new,

335
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
it's fine.

336
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's manageable.

337
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's a migration management.

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
My next question is

339
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
is near zero time

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the migration done

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
to divide it?

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Because if it's near zero time,

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
does that mean

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
that we can do it

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
in a year's time?

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No, no.

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They have to go back

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and do a study

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
on how to divide it.

350
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's how it works

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
in the end.

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes.

353
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
In general,

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
ITU proved

355
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
how good they are.

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Then we have ISO.

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
They did ISO 9001,

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
then 14001,

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
then 12001,

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and so on.

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They're not bad standards.

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They're just implemented

363
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
as they are,

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
but that's another topic.

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The problem is

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that people document

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
the existence of the DREC

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and then they're compliant.

369
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Because they know

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
what they're doing.

371
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They're doing the same DREC

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
as they did in 2001.

373
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Again,

374
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
it's very opaque

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
in Slovenian.

376
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a closed organization

377
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
that gives out some standards

378
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
that you can't get,

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but you can buy.

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And they change

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
as they change.

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The results are what they are.

383
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The whole industry

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
lives from it.

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And thank God

386
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that the Internet

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
is on the side

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
of any of their standards.

389
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
At least 10,000,

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know.

391
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No, no, no, no,

392
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
less than 100.

393
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Really?

394
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes.

395
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The whole ISO 9001 standard

396
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
was changed,

397
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
but it wasn't long.

398
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Really?

399
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes.

400
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You know,

401
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the people who cover this,

402
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
write what you're doing.

403
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's the standard.

404
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then the persuaders,

405
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the Enlighteners,

406
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the Wise Men,

407
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
they do it differently.

408
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Then we have IEEE,

409
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
those are the gentlemen

410
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
who power the Internet,

411
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
the Token Ring,

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the FTDI,

413
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and all those little things.

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And again,

415
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
the whole industry

416
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
is on the side

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
of the public,

418
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and then someone comes out

419
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and says,

420
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
that's it,

421
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
be happy we did something.

422
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Then you have 3GPP.

423
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The same,

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
just different manufacturers.

425
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Those are for mobile networks.

426
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Or ETCs.

427
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Then you have more ETCs.

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Which are ISO,

429
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
but European.

430
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And then you talk to them

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and prove it to them,

432
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and you have a complete history

433
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
of all the scammers

434
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
you've ever told the public.

435
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And there you can go to a meeting,

436
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
go to the microphone,

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and say what you think

438
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
about everything they do there.

439
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then they give you a yo-yo

440
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and send you out.

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Most of them there

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
have long white beards.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But in the end,

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
are there enough

445
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
motivation?

446
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Because I won't go

447
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
to an IETF meeting,

448
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
because it happens.

449
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Besides,

450
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I have a life,

451
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and I don't know why

452
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I would mess with it.

453
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There you have

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
in one working group

455
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
100 people,

456
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of which 98 are paid

457
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
by the manufacturers,

458
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
because they drive through

459
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
what is in the manufacturer's

460
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
complexity,

461
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
because the complexity is sold.

462
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Since the 80s.

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You know,

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
if we do something so simple

465
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
that everyone knows how to implement it,

466
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and everyone knows how to install it,

467
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and everyone knows how to do it

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and sell it,

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
then we've shot ourselves in the foot.

470
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes,

471
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was at some IETF meetings

472
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
when I worked

473
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
for the Internet Society.

474
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You asked

475
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
a very smart question.

476
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
At the IETF,

477
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
there are very smart

478
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and intelligent people.

479
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The flower of intelligence

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
would be overshadowed there.

481
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Now,

482
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
what kind of motives

483
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
do they have?

484
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How much academic knowledge

485
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
do they have?

486
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's huge.

487
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
How much operational knowledge

488
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
do they have?

489
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's a different question.

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You know,

491
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
they have a lot,

492
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
but it's outdated.

493
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There was someone

494
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
from the people who were there

495
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
in their previous life,

496
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Operations.

497
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Then he went to Vendoria,

498
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
where he spent 15 years.

499
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Then he became a Distinguished Engineer.

500
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Then he was allowed

501
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
to speak at the IETF meeting.

502
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And the operational knowledge

503
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
he had

504
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
was overshadowed.

505
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
As much as mine.

506
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Thank God,

507
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't have to install a production box

508
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
for the next 25 years.

509
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
OK.

510
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's go back

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
to

512
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
what you said,

513
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
to the beginning of the war.

514
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you still

515
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
have

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
the knowledge

517
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
of a network engineer?

518
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Do we still need it?

519
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Do you need the one

520
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
who studies so hard?

521
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You need three years.

522
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But you need a curse.

523
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I would say

524
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
it's like those good systems.

525
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If everything works,

526
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
you don't need it.

527
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If it doesn't work,

528
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
where do you get it?

529
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Why don't you have three?

530
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I remember

531
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
when Sreta and I were there.

532
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We installed all the empty tables.

533
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
There was Tom,

534
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Tomas,

535
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and everyone else.

536
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I remember when Sreta pulled me

537
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
from Novi Gorica,

538
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
from Telekom.

539
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
He said

540
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
that the first thing I see

541
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
when I look through the window

542
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
of my office

543
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is that you are in a café

544
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and you are drinking beer.

545
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Because everything works.

546
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You are the one

547
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
who drinks the most beer

548
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
in the café.

549
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Wait a minute.

550
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is an operations man

551
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
who is drunk.

552
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's right.

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It would be better

554
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
if he wasn't drunk.

555
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes, that's why we automate things, so that we are consistently on the page.

556
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I will quote you again.

557
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes, yes.

558
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That was interesting.

559
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Pipi was at the IPv6 Summit a few years ago.

560
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
He said he came to talk about automation.

561
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It was one of the first times when there was a big hype for automation.

562
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Software-defined networking.

563
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yes, and Pipi came and said, you know, automation is basically

564
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
that we can consistently standardize our attacks across the entire network.

565
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So, I remembered that and with that ...

566
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I think I still have a tweet, a screenshot, somewhere in the conversation.

567
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

568
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
He said, to err is human.

569
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
To deploy the error on 10,000 servers is DevOps.

570
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Something like that, yes.

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So, we need these people, but how many people actually decide to do it?

572
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Or, let's ask another person.

573
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What do you see in this person?

574
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
What are the skills this person must have?

575
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Look, first of all, when we started developing the IPv6 community,

576
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
which then grew, I noticed from the very beginning

577
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
that we are missing a few generations.

578
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We have a few generations of gaps in the city.

579
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We were the old school.

580
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Then you have a few generations of gaps that are not necessary.

581
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
These are the generations for whom the internet is clicked on Facebook and Google.

582
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
No, but you know what?

583
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
In Slovenia, for example,

584
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
the market size for these people is relatively fixed.

585
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
If you look at it, the Slovenian economy is not growing much.

586
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Of course, we have the GDP growth rate of 3-5% every year.

587
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But the population of Slovenia is 2 million, and it is relatively constant.

588
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The company in Slovenia is what it is, and it is relatively constant.

589
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
If you want X inhabitants of Slovenia, you need a farmer,

590
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and if you want X inhabitants of Slovenia, you need a networking engineer.

591
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But what about the fact that we have been eating strawberries for the last 100 plus years,

592
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and it has spread well?

593
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
While we two, Jan and everyone else,

594
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
fell into networking at about the same time,

595
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and there are still some people who are doing something.

596
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Some of us went a little on our own,

597
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
a little on half-pension, and a little somewhere else.

598
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But probably 80% of the current generation is still doing something

599
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
on some kind of joint work in the city.

600
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Which means that the next generation simply did not need

601
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
so many people that they would need excessively,

602
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
because we will not die.

603
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's how it is.

604
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
If you look at the Synagogue,

605
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
there are between 100 and 120 people who come to every meeting.

606
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Which is a lot for 2 million people in Slovenia.

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And they are always the same.

608
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We are getting older.

609
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And then it's like that,

610
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
this thing is not sexy enough,

611
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
not too much, not too little.

612
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And is diving sexy?

613
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Well, but,

614
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
someone might say,

615
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and maybe the people are always diving.

616
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes, everything is something like that.

617
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You asked if it's sexy,

618
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
not profitable.

619
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But wait, for some,

620
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I said today,

621
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
a man, a student,

622
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
a student who is graduating,

623
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
what did we say,

624
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
in computer science,

625
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
the question is,

626
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
will I make money with it?

627
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes, you will.

628
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But, let's say,

629
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
an anecdote,

630
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
years ago,

631
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I was at the Synagogue,

632
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
everyone comes,

633
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
students, young people,

634
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
a new generation of networkers has appeared.

635
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You go to the application,

636
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
you click on point A,

637
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and then you click on point B,

638
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and then something happens,

639
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and these two points are connected.

640
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Someone has, my friend,

641
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I go to the datacenter,

642
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I see that someone has to put a router in,

643
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
then a switch, then a cable,

644
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
then configure everything,

645
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and so on.

646
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And now,

647
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
if we celebrate young people,

648
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
or this new generation of network engineers,

649
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and we say that they are connected to the fact

650
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that they don't know,

651
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I would say,

652
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
the history of those builders in the network,

653
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to the extent that they would face them physically,

654
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I mean, they would be more likely to hide it

655
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
through some SD-WAN,

656
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
something that clicks on the Internet,

657
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
or on the interface,

658
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and then something happens,

659
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
or something else?

660
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And the fact that they are really, really interested in it,

661
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and that things are flying,

662
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
as they say, hands-on,

663
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
these guys know,

664
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and if they don't know,

665
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
they ask, they come to SYNOK,

666
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
we welcome them there with open arms and hearts,

667
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and we share our knowledge with them.

668
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Now, if you want to be a network engineer,

669
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
as they say,

670
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
on the easy way,

671
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
to get through as easily as possible,

672
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and you know it all,

673
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and you follow a line of the lowest resistance,

674
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
then you have a lot to learn.

675
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You know, it's the same as mechanics.

676
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You have those mechanics

677
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
who really know how the engine works,

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and you have those mechanics

679
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
who copy the tester from the manufacturer

680
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and burn the test,

681
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
go for a beer,

682
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and then do what the tester tells them.

683
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
For example,

684
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
on a car,

685
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
the tester,

686
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
as they say,

687
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
my mechanic was lost,

688
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the Renault service center was lost,

689
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
the computer was replaced twice,

690
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
because it had to be a computer,

691
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
because if the tester says it,

692
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
no one else will get it.

693
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
In the end, my mechanic went

694
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and with that tester,

695
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
but with a diagnostic user interface,

696
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
he looked at the engine

697
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and said,

698
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
wait a minute,

699
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
this pressure is a bit low.

700
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And in the end,

701
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
the whole thing,

702
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
from the turbocharger to the engine,

703
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
had a hole.

704
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And that was the first time

705
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Renault had that in Slovenia,

706
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and it was such a rare occurrence

707
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that Renault didn't have a tester for that.

708
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But if you don't understand

709
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
what Mr. Tester is,

710
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
you'll never find it.

711
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But that brings us to the topic

712
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
of troubleshooting.

713
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But before we go there,

714
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
you have those

715
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
hardcore network engineers,

716
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
we need a few of them.

717
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Then you have

718
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
installers.

719
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Someone has to patch your wireless,

720
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
someone has to know which lights

721
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
have to be lit,

722
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
someone has to describe...

723
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes.

724
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yes.

725
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Of course, we need that.

726
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Now they only have different connectors.

727
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You know, we need that.

728
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That's the thing.

729
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But that's a middle school thing.

730
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Then,

731
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
everyone who touches networking

732
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
for professional purposes,

733
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
all developers,

734
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
have to know

735
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
what are the properties

736
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
of what they're dealing with.

737
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You know, it's like

738
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
when you try to design a car,

739
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
but you don't know what's the friction

740
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and the tires.

741
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
In the first corner,

742
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
you go out and the road is wrong.

743
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And he designed the road.

744
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Everyone who wants to write

745
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
a web application

746
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
should have that knowledge.

747
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Because every web application

748
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
is a distributed system,

749
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and for every web application

750
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
you have a network.

751
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So, programmers

752
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
who are not motivated

753
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
by the results of their work,

754
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
but by the time spent

755
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
in the workplace,

756
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
have the results I would expect.

757
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
They made a call to API, right?

758
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes.

759
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And everything works on Loopback.

760
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yes, absolutely.

761
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I think the biggest thing is

762
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
that it's not just about

763
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
downloading DNS,

764
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and then everything falls.

765
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
No, but you know what the problem is?

766
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The problem is that they're testing on Loopback,

767
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
or they're testing on a local network.

768
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And again, this is a problem

769
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of the development environment,

770
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
not a problem of the programmer himself.

771
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I mean, again, we have programmers,

772
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
but we also have software engineers.

773
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
A software engineer

774
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
would have to know

775
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
what a distributed system is.

776
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Programmers don't care.

777
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
They get specifications,

778
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and they make their own.

779
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But a software engineer

780
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
would have to know.

781
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
For a programmer,

782
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
a thousand lines of code is this much.

783
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's right.

784
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But the problem is that

785
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
no one ever tests

786
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
this master product

787
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
in a way that would be

788
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
similar to the real environment.

789
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
With real bandwidth

790
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and real latency.

791
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's all you need.

792
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You know,

793
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
as long as you don't test the car in the yard,

794
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
you can put it on the road.

795
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But what if this other extreme happens,

796
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
where everything is connected to the cloud,

797
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and then it's put into the situation?

798
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Can I tell you a story about the cloud?

799
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We're not there yet,

800
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
but we can.

801
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes, something...

802
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I mean, we just changed the latency.

803
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We put everything into the cloud,

804
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and that's it.

805
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
A multinational company decided

806
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
that the workload should be moved

807
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to the cloud.

808
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And private.

809
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
All right.

810
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Very well done migration.

811
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Everything went as planned.

812
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Everything went as it should.

813
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Applications were working more slowly.

814
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Everything was running in the cloud.

815
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Only the clients were local.

816
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
They had a database.

817
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But what's wrong?

818
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What has changed since the 5th of April?

819
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The network, right?

820
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Must be the network.

821
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Where was the cloud?

822
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
At the other end of the world?

823
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
How do you know?

824
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
In a country

825
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
that is geographically

826
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
very close,

827
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
but outside of the EU.

828
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That's an important information.

829
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And the packages go through China?

830
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No.

831
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Of course, the network engineer knows the subject.

832
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So the mean time to innocence

833
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
was a few weeks.

834
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Here it's necessary to prove

835
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that it's not the network.

836
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Then they finally started to look

837
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
what the database is doing.

838
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And they realized that the complete database

839
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
in the cloud,

840
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
which was 10 milliseconds away from the client,

841
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
username and password

842
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and authentication

843
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
is called locally because GDPR.

844
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well done.

845
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And every request

846
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
that you made on the database

847
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
in the country X

848
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
was sent back another request

849
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
to ask if the user

850
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
can make that request on the database X.

851
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So latency can be important.

852
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You know how I like to talk about the cloud.

853
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I adore cloud storage.

854
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I adore it from the bottom of my heart.

855
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So far, the cloud is on my disks,

856
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
on my servers,

857
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
in my datacenter.

858
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, I've been living on the cloud

859
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
for years and years

860
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and everything is good

861
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
in the cloud.

862
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I mean,

863
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
thank God I don't have to deal

864
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
with those eggs anymore

865
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and that someone else starts it.

866
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
There are no real problems.

867
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
There must be some,

868
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
but it's good that they don't sell more things

869
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
than everything.

870
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I mean, every environment

871
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
or you can say

872
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
every developer

873
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
gives you some constraints.

874
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
If you go beyond that

875
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and you don't care about it...

876
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
That's the problem.

877
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Because, let's say,

878
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
US East 1

879
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
fell on Amazon

880
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and 80%

881
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
of web stories went to the cloud.

882
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
The problem is

883
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that Amazon made it very clear

884
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that we never

885
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
want the whole region

886
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
to go to the cloud.

887
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And if you have a mission critical application,

888
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
you must have an application

889
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
in at least two regions.

890
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And we have the tools to do that.

891
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We have that load balancer,

892
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
load balancer 3, load balancer DNA.

893
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We have Anycast, for example.

894
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Even Amazon has Anycast.

895
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes, it lasted.

896
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yes.

897
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Before they buried the whole region.

898
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
No, you know what?

899
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You don't need Anycast

900
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
if you have a good enough DNA

901
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and an application

902
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
that works in the browser.

903
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You need Anycast

904
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
for things that don't need

905
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
DNA.

906
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I just built

907
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
one

908
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
this year.

909
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Global Anycast Network.

910
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It will finally be streamed.

911
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And it is...

912
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I have to admit something.

913
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Now that I've built

914
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Global Anycast Network,

915
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I've learned more about BGPU

916
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
than in the last 10 years.

917
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You've finally learned about BGPU.

918
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Now I'm going to interrupt you.

919
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You know,

920
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
we've gone deep

921
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
into the technology.

922
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
What are the basics?

923
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Just a little bit about what Anycast is.

924
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
What is Anycast?

925
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Unicast, right?

926
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That's what most people use.

927
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
No, let's start with DNA.

928
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh boy. No, DNA will be your name.

929
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
OK. You have a server on two locations.

930
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And now the Americans

931
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
choose a location,

932
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and the Europeans choose another location.

933
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The first way to do that

934
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
is to have those two locations

935
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
with different names.

936
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And the DNS server will find you

937
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and give you one or the other name.

938
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's classic.

939
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But watch out.

940
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That breaks the DNS-RFC.

941
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Because the DNS

942
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
in the beginning would always

943
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
have to be the same.

944
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm not going there.

945
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And it breaks the DNSSEC.

946
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Unless you disassemble

947
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
all the keys and sign them.

948
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But yes, in the beginning

949
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
it breaks fundamentally.

950
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That's pure high availability.

951
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Now let's talk about

952
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
how much

953
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the GeoDNS feature

954
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
uses DNSSEC.

955
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I didn't do anything to it, did I?

956
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Wait a minute.

957
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You don't have to sign both records.

958
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes, but then you have to disassemble

959
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
all the keys.

960
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
No, wait a minute.

961
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You have a private key,

962
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and you sign the answer with the private key.

963
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The client can check it

964
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
with the public key.

965
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
The truth is that you can have

966
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
different zones

967
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
with different identities,

968
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
but you don't have to sign

969
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
with your private key.

970
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yes, and it quickly becomes complex.

971
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No, but you have to have

972
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the same private key

973
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
at all locations.

974
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Yes, and you don't want

975
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
your private key,

976
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
no matter how serious it is,

977
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
to have it at a secure location.

978
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
No, look, you can still have

979
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
the NDNS server.

980
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yes, and you sign more different zones,

981
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and then you disassemble them.

982
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yes, and then it becomes complex very quickly.

983
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You know what the problem is?

984
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's the debate we had before,

985
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
that the Socket API is broken.

986
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Yes.

987
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Because the application,

988
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
if you look at how,

989
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
not how a high-level API is written

990
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
for, I don't know, JavaScript,

991
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but if you look at what

992
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
really happens in a library,

993
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
which is actually a bundle

994
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
with its own binary,

995
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
or a shared library on Linux,

996
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
or Windows, or whatever.

997
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I think Apple is the only one.

998
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The application

999
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
asks the operating system

1000
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
how to map

1001
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
this name to this title.

1002
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And then the application

1003
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
says,

1004
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
please give me a link

1005
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
to this title.

1006
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And now,

1007
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
in a normal world,

1008
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the application would say,

1009
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I need a link

1010
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
to this title,

1011
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and the operating system would do the rest.

1012
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What we have today

1013
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
is that the DNS returns

1014
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
not one response, but

1015
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
2, 4, 8,

1016
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
16, however many words,

1017
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
half of which is IPv4,

1018
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
half of which is IPv6.

1019
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And then, of course,

1020
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
the rules are made.

1021
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
First, try IPv6

1022
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
words, and then IPv4 words.

1023
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And in the entire operating system,

1024
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
this is also implemented,

1025
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
or pre-sorted, because we can't

1026
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
believe that the programmer

1027
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
will do it correctly.

1028
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So you have Happy Eyeballs, right?

1029
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
No, Happy Eyeballs is implemented

1030
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
in the application.

1031
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
No, it's not on the operating system either.

1032
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
On Apple.

1033
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
On Apple, not on Linux.

1034
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Happy Eyeballs is,

1035
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
for example,

1036
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
implemented in macOS

1037
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
at the operating system level,

1038
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but with another API.

1039
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
For those of you who don't follow

1040
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Happy Eyeballs,

1041
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
that is, that data set

1042
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
over 6 that you get, which is identical...

1043
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
No, no, no.

1044
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You send requests

1045
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
for IPv4 and IPv6.

1046
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You try both of them right away.

1047
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Right away.

1048
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
A little later.

1049
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yes, depending on the implementation.

1050
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And then, according to the same protocol

1051
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
you take it

1052
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
as the primary protocol

1053
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and use it for the destination.

1054
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The problem is, of course,

1055
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
that you can get it back,

1056
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
it's still installed, but then the data

1057
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
doesn't go through.

1058
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If I had understood

1059
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Happy Eyeballs, I would have solved that part too.

1060
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
You know what, Happy Eyeballs

1061
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
is what we lack, for example.

1062
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I don't.

1063
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Look, the first problem

1064
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
is that the operating system

1065
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
doesn't connect the data API

1066
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
to the device.

1067
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's like if I wanted

1068
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
to talk to you,

1069
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and then someone would say to me,

1070
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
go to 12.5.

1071
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'd be like, I don't want to.

1072
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
No, no, 12.5.

1073
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And then I come, I say,

1074
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I went out.

1075
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
No,

1076
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
you can't.

1077
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Try another word.

1078
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Now, you get back

1079
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
to X word, and then

1080
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
it depends on how smart you are as a programmer,

1081
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
if you don't use some books.

1082
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
What's wrong with those books?

1083
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You don't know. That's the next problem.

1084
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Because in time,

1085
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
you went through that list of words,

1086
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
you tried, you wrote it

1087
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
with the device, and every time you waited

1088
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
three minutes.

1089
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, the timeout was fantastic.

1090
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes, and that's how

1091
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
IPv6

1092
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
worked on, for example, Windows

1093
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and Linux, and because of that,

1094
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
nothing started to crash.

1095
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
IPv6 was before IPv4.

1096
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
If IPv6 was broken,

1097
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
it didn't do anything, because every time

1098
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
it waited three minutes before the timeout.

1099
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And that's why they made

1100
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Happy Eyeballs, but Happy Eyeballs

1101
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
is implemented in the browser.

1102
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yes.

1103
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
In the application.

1104
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Every application that

1105
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
wants to behave similarly,

1106
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
has to implement the same code,

1107
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
in the same way.

1108
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yes, Happy Eyeballs solved

1109
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
the fear of operators.

1110
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Do you know that I was in

1111
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
a design group in Prague

1112
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
when we designed

1113
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Happy Eyeballs with

1114
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Endro Jurčenko and Dan.

1115
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The first one.

1116
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yes, but

1117
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
it turned out that

1118
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
just as Happy Eyeballs

1119
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
is good and useful

1120
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and nice and lovely

1121
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and everything,

1122
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
it's hard for those

1123
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
who would like to disable

1124
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
IPv4.

1125
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Because Happy Eyeballs

1126
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
masks all the problems

1127
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
on the IPv6 protocol in the network.

1128
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It's the MWD syndrome.

1129
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Everything works for me.

1130
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And then,

1131
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
if someone gets on Facebook

1132
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
or Google or whatever,

1133
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
the user is not interested

1134
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
in IPv4 or IPv6.

1135
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
He doesn't care

1136
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
where the electricity

1137
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
comes from.

1138
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Mine is from the nuclear power plant.

1139
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That's what it says on my account.

1140
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If you trust the operators

1141
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
or the distributors.

1142
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's not like

1143
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
the electronics can decide

1144
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and paint them.

1145
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
On a network level,

1146
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
it's possible.

1147
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Network vendors

1148
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
do it because

1149
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
they take the complexity into account.

1150
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's called 5G network slicing.

1151
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yep.

1152
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
OK, sorry.

1153
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Anyway,

1154
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
it masks a lot of problems

1155
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and prevents

1156
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
people from actively

1157
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
troubleshooting

1158
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
their IPv6 network.

1159
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Now we have the same problem

1160
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
with QUIC.

1161
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
TCP versus QUIC.

1162
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
One is TCP, the other is UDP.

1163
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Again,

1164
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
the implementations

1165
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
try to make both

1166
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
short.

1167
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So,

1168
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
if you go to a website,

1169
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you try to make it 4-series.

1170
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, now we're working

1171
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
on DNS over QUIC.

1172
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That'll be fun.

1173
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That'll be fun.

1174
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I can enable it

1175
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
in the lab

1176
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
later.

1177
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
When we go

1178
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
step by step,

1179
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
we like encapsulation

1180
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
more.

1181
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Anyone who touches

1182
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
networking should

1183
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
switch to RFC1925.

1184
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yep.

1185
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
What does it say?

1186
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's about 12 rules

1187
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
of networking.

1188
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
One of them is

1189
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
it's always something.

1190
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah, it's always something.

1191
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
One of them is

1192
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
every old idea

1193
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
will be propagated

1194
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
in a new form.

1195
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
With a new buzzword

1196
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
in marketing.

1197
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And the other one,

1198
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
what did I mean?

1199
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You can always add

1200
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
another level of indirection.

1201
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And complexity.

1202
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I like the first one.

1203
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It should work.

1204
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That's the first rule of networking.

1205
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The other one is...

1206
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
With sufficient trust,

1207
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
pigs fly just fine.

1208
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Yeah.

1209
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
If we have enough drive...

1210
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
They fly well.

1211
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But maybe I'm wrong.

1212
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
In a way, you want to say

1213
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
that,

1214
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
considering how these things stand,

1215
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
every developer

1216
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
would solve

1217
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
the problem

1218
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
on an application level.

1219
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
No, that's a mistake.

1220
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
No.

1221
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Let's say that...

1222
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Let's use libraries.

1223
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yes, but...

1224
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That it will be solved on the operating system,

1225
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
that the apps will be able to call...

1226
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes, but you have to know that laws of physics exist.

1227
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You're offloading this problem to a good library, thank God.

1228
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Because if we all use the same library,

1229
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
then like OpenSSN,

1230
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
we will all end up on the same bug at the same time,

1231
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and someone will come and screw it up.

1232
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And now we have 3-4 libraries on the same...

1233
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's all the same.

1234
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
The problem is that you have someone who doesn't use a library.

1235
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You take a 15-year-old book,

1236
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Python for beginners,

1237
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
copy the code from there and let's go.

1238
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yes.

1239
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That's the problem.

1240
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Copy-paste, with IP, right?

1241
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yes, yes.

1242
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
With IP, yes.

1243
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
With old code.

1244
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
No, I mean, that's next.

1245
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I had...

1246
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Once I had a problem with a programmer,

1247
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
who didn't do anything,

1248
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
he decided it was a DNS problem,

1249
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and he did a resolve,

1250
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
he resolved the name of the server in the IP address,

1251
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and the IP address in the source code.

1252
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Beautiful.

1253
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
He didn't put it in the configuration file.

1254
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
No.

1255
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's always DNS.

1256
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
No, the assumption that

1257
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
whenever you start with the IP address inside,

1258
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
even if it's more dynamic,

1259
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
that you go with that assumption,

1260
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
it can also be 6.

1261
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yes.

1262
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You never expect anything.

1263
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Yes.

1264
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And you know what?

1265
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
In the 90s, a gentleman who worked on Sun,

1266
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
because Sun had this remote procedure,

1267
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
which was already very developed,

1268
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
he wrote some networking,

1269
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I mean distributed systems,

1270
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
not even fallacies.

1271
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And every programmer would have to go and think about it.

1272
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Because, for example,

1273
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
bandwidth is infinite,

1274
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
latency is zero,

1275
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
the network is secure,

1276
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
there is a single administrator.

1277
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And three more like that.

1278
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Latency, you have zero to localhost.

1279
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
To loopback, yes.

1280
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yes.

1281
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yes.

1282
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Hey, but if, for example,

1283
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
now I'm a bit monotonous,

1284
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and I say,

1285
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and now you,

1286
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
someone asks you,

1287
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and we go to the same...

1288
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
No, no, no.

1289
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That's a great idea.

1290
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It's great.

1291
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Try it now.

1292
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
What do you see as Don's biggest problems,

1293
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
with which, for example,

1294
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I don't know,

1295
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
we started with cloud,

1296
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
let's say that cloud providers

1297
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
are the biggest consumers of the network,

1298
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
on the one hand,

1299
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and you probably have the biggest administration.

1300
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
What do you see as their biggest challenges,

1301
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
with which they are dealing today?

1302
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And I'll tell you the opposite,

1303
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
because you probably have more access

1304
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
to work for operators.

1305
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
What are Don's biggest challenges for operators?

1306
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Because, for example,

1307
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I don't know,

1308
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
20 years ago,

1309
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
there were,

1310
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I don't know,

1311
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
how to have a large enough uplink,

1312
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and how to get the bandwidth to the end user.

1313
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
What are Don's challenges,

1314
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
with which...

1315
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You know how it is,

1316
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
what are the challenges of cloud providers?

1317
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
We don't even know the answer to that.

1318
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Even that secret sauce.

1319
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Because, in fact,

1320
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
everything they do is a secret sauce,

1321
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
and everything they do is a recruitment drive.

1322
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Every time you have someone

1323
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
from Google at a RIPE meeting

1324
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
who says how phenomenal Google OSDN is,

1325
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
or how phenomenal their datacenter Fabric is,

1326
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
it's purely a recruitment drive.

1327
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Because you never...

1328
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
For example,

1329
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
there's a crazy difference

1330
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
between Cloudflare on one side,

1331
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
and Google and Amazon on the other.

1332
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Amazon shouldn't be there.

1333
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Fair.

1334
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yes.

1335
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
They do their own thing.

1336
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Every now and then,

1337
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
they tell you a little bit

1338
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
about what's going on

1339
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
at one level under the API,

1340
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
so that you understand

1341
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
how to properly use the API.

1342
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
They tell you the same details as...

1343
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Here.

1344
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
The region has more zones,

1345
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
the zone is a failure domain,

1346
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
the zones are...

1347
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
We guarantee that these two zones

1348
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
are two different datacenters,

1349
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
but if you want redundancy,

1350
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
there are two regions,

1351
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
but what's inside?

1352
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
An awkward silence,

1353
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and Amazon is madly silent.

1354
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
As you said,

1355
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
my friend works at Amazon,

1356
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
he falls into a black hole,

1357
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
dies for Event Horizon,

1358
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and you don't hear his silence anymore.

1359
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Google only boasts.

1360
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
At conferences,

1361
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
they boast how good they are,

1362
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
and smart,

1363
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and omnipotent,

1364
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
and I don't know what,

1365
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
but when you look at their article,

1366
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
there's always that interesting 10% deficit.

1367
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And then everyone falls for it.

1368
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Google does it,

1369
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
we have to do it too.

1370
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Then there's GIPHY,

1371
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
or Google Infrastructure for Everyone Else,

1372
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and that's the biggest tech

1373
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
we've seen in the world,

1374
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
including Kubernetes.

1375
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Then you have smaller players,

1376
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
like Cloudflare,

1377
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
where I actually choose their engineering blog

1378
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
with great pleasure,

1379
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
because they dive into details

1380
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I've never dived into in my life.

1381
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
For example,

1382
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
how does a patch in Linux Kernel

1383
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
cause your latency to inevitably increase by X,

1384
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
and split to zero?

1385
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
At the end,

1386
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
they always write,

1387
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
guys, if you're interested in such problems,

1388
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
are you interested in WeAreHiring?

1389
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Look, that's fair.

1390
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Classic, yeah.

1391
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
That's fair.

1392
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You gave something from yourself,

1393
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
of course,

1394
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
you'll say you'll take something back

1395
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
if someone is interested.

1396
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Cool.

1397
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I asked nicely.

1398
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
More of that.

1399
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But what kind of problems do these people have?

1400
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We have no idea.

1401
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Because it's like,

1402
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I don't know,

1403
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
the three of us are working on this bicycle,

1404
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
and we're talking about what kind of problems

1405
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Falcon has with the mask.

1406
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Or that we have unmodelled rockets,

1407
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
you know.

1408
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It's just another planet.

1409
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
In terms of their speed,

1410
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
in terms of their size,

1411
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
in terms of how quickly they change,

1412
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
it's another planet.

1413
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And you probably don't have anything

1414
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
that would have an overview,

1415
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
because there are so many employees,

1416
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
that everything is really small.

1417
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, that too,

1418
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but nothing comes out.

1419
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
My assumption is,

1420
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
with some kind of engineering,

1421
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
they've come up with their proprietary protocol,

1422
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
which they solve.

1423
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Everyone has it.

1424
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Everyone has it.

1425
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And their proprietary hardware,

1426
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
do they solve some problems?

1427
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Or keep it simple,

1428
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and let's just...

1429
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
No.

1430
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You know what the problem is?

1431
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
First of all,

1432
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
they have problems that no one else has.

1433
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Definitely.

1434
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Because of the size.

1435
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And because of that,

1436
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
you don't get hardware

1437
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that would solve their problems.

1438
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
On the other hand,

1439
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
if you look at it,

1440
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
the big cloud providers

1441
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
are probably 20-30% of the networking market.

1442
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Yes.

1443
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
In fact,

1444
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Whitebox switches were the second largest vendor

1445
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
for Cisco,

1446
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and I don't know who the third one is.

1447
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And that goes to the big cloud providers.

1448
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And you know what I have a feeling about cloud providers?

1449
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Every time they solve their problem,

1450
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
they try to solve it with their proprietary hardware,

1451
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
they generate 5-6 new ones.

1452
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And then,

1453
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
at the same size,

1454
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and with how fast they run,

1455
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and how much bandwidth they have.

1456
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But those are proprietary solutions.

1457
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Yes.

1458
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But look,

1459
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
no one else in the world,

1460
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
not only is not interested in it,

1461
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
but you know how much work you have to do

1462
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
if you want to give something that you have developed

1463
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
in a state that will still be usable for someone else?

1464
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Oh,

1465
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
that's huge.

1466
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yes.

1467
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
That's why we now have Kubernetes

1468
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
in the state it is in.

1469
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Well,

1470
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Kubernetes is Google's attack,

1471
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
because if I manage to make sure

1472
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
that this API is correct,

1473
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
then I will be able to sell my cloud

1474
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
because I don't have to sell anything

1475
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
because I don't have a support.

1476
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
No,

1477
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I see that this is the silver bullet

1478
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
with which we will solve all the problems.

1479
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Yes,

1480
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
OpenStack was there too.

1481
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Yes,

1482
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
but it didn't sell that well.

1483
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yes,

1484
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
because it was sold by networking vendors,

1485
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
not by Google.

1486
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
No.

1487
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But when I developed OpenStack,

1488
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
the last version I developed

1489
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
was a beta version.

1490
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I was a beta version too, right?

1491
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
No.

1492
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I mean,

1493
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
now it was practically unusable.

1494
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I mean,

1495
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
OpenStack was

1496
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
the way networking,

1497
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I mean,

1498
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
networking compute storage vendors

1499
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
made their complexity into a market.

1500
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yes,

1501
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
and this is as close as possible

1502
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
to the API of Amazon.

1503
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yes,

1504
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I tried to install OpenStack.

1505
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I wanted to install it,

1506
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
but if I wanted to get something useful out of it,

1507
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I think I would need to study it for a year,

1508
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
what they had in mind there,

1509
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
completely against some logic

1510
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
that we have been following for 20-30 years.

1511
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yes.

1512
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
But you can still upgrade Kubernetes.

1513
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Kubernetes is nothing better, right?

1514
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yes.

1515
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's nothing better.

1516
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Yes.

1517
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Well,

1518
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
in general,

1519
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
we don't know what problems they have.

1520
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
What we know,

1521
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
what we see,

1522
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
is what kind of chips

1523
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Broadcom puts on the market.

1524
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Because Broadcom puts chips on the market

1525
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
that will be bought by cloud providers.

1526
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And now Broadcom bought VMware,

1527
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and we all won.

1528
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Oh,

1529
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
you are...

1530
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Do you remember CIA?

1531
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Where?

1532
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Computer Associates.

1533
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Yes.

1534
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Where the old software goes to die.

1535
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yes.

1536
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Broadcom is the same.

1537
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yes.

1538
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
For Broadcom,

1539
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
VMware is just cash,

1540
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
like they will...

1541
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Didn't they buy Brocade in their time?

1542
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I think so, yes.

1543
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
You know,

1544
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
they bought Brocade

1545
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
because of the installed

1546
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Fibre Channel base,

1547
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and then they took the cow from it

1548
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
while it was dying of old age,

1549
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and now they bought the next cow

1550
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
which they will milk

1551
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
until it dies of old age.

1552
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I heard from Brocade

1553
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
that they were

1554
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
highly dependent on

1555
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
those high frequency traders

1556
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
on the stock market.

1557
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
No.

1558
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
They still work there.

1559
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Not for long.

1560
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
What did they replace?

1561
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Well,

1562
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
they did everything

1563
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
just for a microsecond.

1564
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You know,

1565
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
there was,

1566
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I don't know,

1567
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
16 GB

1568
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Fibre Channel,

1569
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and on the other side

1570
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
100 or 200 GB

1571
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Ethernet.

1572
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yes.

1573
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
The end.

1574
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Goodbye.

1575
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
They...

1576
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
They work for nanoseconds.

1577
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yes, yes.

1578
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
ISP.

1579
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
ISP.

1580
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
With which...

1581
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
What are their biggest challenges?

1582
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Well,

1583
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
as we said at the beginning...

1584
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
ARPU.

1585
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
The base hasn't changed

1586
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
since the 90s.

1587
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Still,

1588
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
instead of these two

1589
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
we have Optico.

1590
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
The main operator is BGP.

1591
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Now there is RPKI.

1592
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
They play a little

1593
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
with the BGP community.

1594
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
DNS is still

1595
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
more or less the same

1596
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
as it used to be

1597
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
with DNSSEC.

1598
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
We are not all good

1599
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
at the Internet,

1600
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
but you also have

1601
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
different players.

1602
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So,

1603
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
practically...

1604
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You have an estimation

1605
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
of how much DNSSEC

1606
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
is used now.

1607
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
For all of you

1608
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
who are listening,

1609
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
what does it mean

1610
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
that requests

1611
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
and those

1612
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that go to DNSSEC

1613
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
are signed,

1614
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
so that you can say

1615
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
that...

1616
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Not only answers

1617
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
are signed.

1618
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Answers are signed.

1619
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Requests are not signed.

1620
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Of course.

1621
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Answers are signed

1622
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
so that you believe

1623
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
that those

1624
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
that went back

1625
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
are used.

1626
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Yes.

1627
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You can check

1628
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
on the VEA website.

1629
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Now,

1630
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
the problem

1631
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
of the operators

1632
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
that are currently

1633
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
there

1634
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
is that

1635
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
the amount

1636
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
of traffic

1637
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
that flows

1638
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
through their network

1639
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
started to increase

1640
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
exponentially

1641
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
because of

1642
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
those over-the-top

1643
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
servers

1644
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
that were offered

1645
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
by various

1646
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Google

1647
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and other

1648
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
companies.

1649
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So,

1650
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
there are

1651
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
a lot of

1652
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
servers

1653
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
that are

1654
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
running

1655
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
on Netflix

1656
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
and other

1657
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Google

1658
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
and so on.

1659
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Netflix.

1660
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Let's say

1661
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Netflix.

1662
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Netflix,

1663
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
yes.

1664
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And so on.

1665
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Then,

1666
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
there was

1667
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
an idea

1668
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
at the level

1669
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
of some

1670
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
European

1671
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
association

1672
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
that

1673
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
the operators

1674
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
would start

1675
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
to charge

1676
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
those

1677
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
people

1678
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
for their

1679
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
services

1680
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
and the

1681
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
traffic

1682
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
that flows

1683
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
through their

1684
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
network.

1685
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So,

1686
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
the first

1687
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
question

1688
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
that

1689
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
the operators

1690
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
would ask

1691
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
was

1692
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
whether

1693
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
they should

1694
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
charge

1695
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
their users

1696
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
for that bandwidth.

1697
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
If you

1698
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
offer

1699
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
1 gigabit

1700
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
per second

1701
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
for optics

1702
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
for me

1703
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
at home,

1704
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I somehow

1705
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
pay for it.

1706
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Why would

1707
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I have to

1708
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
pay for

1709
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
the other

1710
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
one for you?

1711
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
But,

1712
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
look,

1713
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
this is

1714
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
a different

1715
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
problem

1716
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
when it comes

1717
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
to China.

1718
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Yes.

1719
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Maybe

1720
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Google

1721
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
deserves

1722
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
1 euro

1723
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
per month

1724
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
for you.

1725
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Almost

1726
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
80%

1727
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
of your

1728
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
bandwidth.

1729
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Telekom

1730
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
or

1731
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
even

1732
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Slovenia

1733
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
deserves

1734
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
30-50

1735
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
euros

1736
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
per month

1737
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
for you.

1738
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
What will

1739
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
20%

1740
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
of that

1741
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
1 euro

1742
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
be?

1743
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It will

1744
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
be

1745
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
a

1746
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
bit

1747
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
more

1748
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
expensive

1749
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
than

1750
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
a

1751
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
brick

1752
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
house.

1753
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Yes,

1754
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
yes,

1755
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
yes,

1756
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
yes.

1757
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
The Germans

1758
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
are already

1759
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
sanding

1760
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
their business

1761
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
into the ground.

1762
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
The difficulty

1763
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
in the

1764
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
operators,

1765
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'm not

1766
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
talking about

1767
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Slovenians

1768
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
only,

1769
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
but when

1770
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
they started

1771
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
to

1772
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
make

1773
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
connections

1774
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
to the

1775
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
internet,

1776
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
but

1777
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
then the

1778
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
TV came,

1779
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
the internet,

1780
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
the telephone.

1781
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
No,

1782
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
no,

1783
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
give me

1784
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
some

1785
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
understanding.

1786
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
All

1787
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
European

1788
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
operators

1789
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
started

1790
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
as

1791
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
state

1792
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
monopolists.

1793
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And

1794
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
those were

1795
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
the golden

1796
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
years

1797
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
when they

1798
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
made

1799
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
telephones,

1800
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
they

1801
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
made

1802
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
them

1803
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
in

1804
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
some

1805
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
road

1806
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
stations,

1807
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
it's

1808
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
expensive

1809
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
as

1810
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
pork.

1811
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And

1812
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
three times

1813
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
before the

1814
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
telephone

1815
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
they

1816
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
took us

1817
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
away

1818
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
with that

1819
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
and lived

1820
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
well

1821
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
from that

1822
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and had

1823
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
high

1824
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
profits

1825
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and three

1826
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
times

1827
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
more

1828
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
profits

1829
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
than

1830
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
they

1831
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
had

1832
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
in

1833
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
the

1834
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
internet.

1835
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And

1836
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
all of

1837
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
them

1838
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
knew

1839
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
that

1840
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
they

1841
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
had

1842
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
to go

1843
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
there

1844
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
and

1845
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
they

1846
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
jumped

1847
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
on the

1848
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
internet,

1849
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
but

1850
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
here

1851
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
you only

1852
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
compete

1853
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
with the

1854
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
price.

1855
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The

1856
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
only

1857
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
thing

1858
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
that

1859
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
you

1860
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
can

1861
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
do

1862
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
with

1863
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
the

internet

1865
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
is

1866
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
that

1867
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
you

1868
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
can

1869
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
use

1870
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
the

internet

1872
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
as

1873
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
much

1874
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
as

1875
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
you

1876
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
can

2204
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Let

2205
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
us

2206
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
start

2207
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
with

2208
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
our

2209
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,400
I asked them if it is possible to change it, if they have something in mind,

2210
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,400
and they said that they have something in mind.

2211
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:17,400
No, I don't know, I only know how they built the local copper fence.

2212
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,400
And that, if you look at it from the side, it was honoured,

2213
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:29,400
because the copper network in Slovenia was built during the time of the monopolists,

2214
01:15:29,799 --> 01:15:30,799
from my ass.

2215
01:15:31,799 --> 01:15:34,799
You didn't have a competitive copper network?

2216
01:15:35,799 --> 01:15:36,799
No, but for good reason.

2217
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:38,799
Yes, yes, yes, you were right.

2218
01:15:39,799 --> 01:15:43,799
Now it seems that they also developed optics.

2219
01:15:44,799 --> 01:15:49,799
Yes, I asked the director if I could have a beer,

2220
01:15:49,799 --> 01:15:52,799
and I said to him, what would you do?

2221
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:54,799
That's better.

2222
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,200
I said, why would you try to separate these two,

2223
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,200
first of all, they are not state-owned,

2224
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,199
and second of all, we realized that for them,

2225
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:08,199
as it was before, the mines are owned by one person,

2226
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:10,199
the cables are owned by another person,

2227
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,199
the connectors are owned by a third person,

2228
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:14,199
the rivers are owned by a fourth person.

2229
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:17,199
They forgot that they are a bit too low-dug,

2230
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,199
and because of that, their cables are not drawn on the wall,

2231
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:22,199
because they shouldn't be.

2232
01:16:22,599 --> 01:16:27,599
Oh, do you want to hear an anecdote from Rwanda,

2233
01:16:27,599 --> 01:16:31,599
where it was said that the mines are too low-dug?

2234
01:16:31,599 --> 01:16:35,599
There, in rural Rwanda, they put an optical cable

2235
01:16:35,599 --> 01:16:39,599
through the connection to another country,

2236
01:16:39,599 --> 01:16:42,599
and they didn't dig deep enough.

2237
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:45,599
The result was that the locals went there,

2238
01:16:45,599 --> 01:16:48,599
took that cable out, and cut it off.

2239
01:16:48,599 --> 01:16:51,599
First, they thought it was optics,

2240
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and then they cut it off a few times.

2241
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I have the same story from South Africa.

2242
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Wait, wait.

2243
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
This reminds me of Liquid Telecom,

2244
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
when they started it.

2245
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
They hired a security service

2246
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
to keep an eye on that cable,

2247
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
to see if it was leaking.

2248
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And it didn't go very well,

2249
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
because they still cut that cable.

2250
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And then one of them remembered,

2251
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
and said, let's call a local shaman.

2252
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:21,399
They gave him $100,

2253
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:23,399
and he cut the cable,

2254
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:27,399
and put those symbols on the cable.

2255
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:35,399
However, the shaman didn't touch that cable anymore.

2256
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:39,399
But now they have other problems.

2257
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:42,399
They go to the parties and say,

2258
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:44,399
can you please not send our product

2259
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:46,399
through the cable?

2260
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,800
So, with too little digging,

2261
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,800
such things can be solved quickly.

2262
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,800
But we don't have shamans here.

2263
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,800
No, you know what the problem is?

2264
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,800
As Baba Chula Baba said,

2265
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,800
the problem is that other people

2266
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,800
who dig don't know that those cables

2267
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,800
are there because they are not torn.

2268
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,800
And then they take the cable out,

2269
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:18,199
and look for the cable in the middle of the tunnel.

2270
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:21,199
We are still waiting for that here.

2271
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,199
Once it burned here,

2272
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,199
now we are waiting for the other one.

2273
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,199
You can say that here is the railway bridge

2274
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,199
over the Danube.

2275
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,199
Do you know why a real network engineer

2276
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,199
likes to go to the mountains?

2277
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,199
Do you have an optical patch cable with you?

2278
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:38,199
No.

2279
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,199
You can always have a couple of meters

2280
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:42,199
of optical cable with you.

2281
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,600
If you kill the cable,

2282
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,600
you bury it in the ground

2283
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,600
and before you know it,

2284
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,600
a bugger will come and plug it in.

2285
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,600
A life-saving device.

2286
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,600
Let's go back to Slovenian operators.

2287
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,600
Congratulations to all of them.

2288
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,600
The internet we have in Slovenia

2289
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,600
is in accordance with the law

2290
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,600
of the most developed world.

2291
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I didn't even realize

2292
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
that I was on IPv6.

2293
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Let's summarize.

2294
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
IPv6.

2295
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Don's is a new organization.

2296
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
If they want their own PI space,

2297
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
they only have IPv6.

2298
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Everything else they have to buy

2299
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
at the white market, black market.

2300
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:42,399
Last week I was in Montenegro.

2301
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:46,399
I helped to establish their leg.

2302
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:48,399
Montenegro is not the only country

2303
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:51,399
in the Balkans that has a network operator.

2304
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:53,399
Congratulations Montenegrins.

2305
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:55,399
Why are there so many cows?

2306
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:57,399
Montenegro.

2307
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:00,399
It was great.

2308
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:02,399
We had a great time.

2309
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,399
A friend from Karsolinka came with me.

2310
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:10,799
Karsolinka is an operator

2311
01:20:10,799 --> 01:20:13,799
that was established in 2018-2019.

2312
01:20:15,799 --> 01:20:18,799
It was after IPv4.

2313
01:20:19,799 --> 01:20:22,799
It was a car company.

2314
01:20:22,799 --> 01:20:25,799
He told me about his experience

2315
01:20:25,799 --> 01:20:28,799
of how to become an ISP

2316
01:20:28,799 --> 01:20:31,799
after your question.

2317
01:20:33,799 --> 01:20:36,799
They hired 2-4 ISPs

2318
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,200
for IPv4.

2319
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,200
Then they got into the queue

2320
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:47,200
at the top of the queue.

2321
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,200
Was there a shortage of ISPs?

2322
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,200
There were 22.

2323
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,200
Now you get 24.

2324
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,200
You have to queue up.

2325
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,200
There was a shortage of ISPs.

2326
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,600
If you become an ISP today,

2327
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,600
you get ISN and IPv6 resources.

2328
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,600
How often do you queue up?

2329
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,600
You have to queue up.

2330
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,600
At the last RIPE meeting,

2331
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,600
Sander, Gerd and I went to queue up.

2332
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,600
It was not a boundary.

2333
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,600
It is easier to queue up.

2334
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,600
They started with IPv4.

2335
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
They soon realized

2336
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
that there is no point in queueing up.

2337
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
They started thinking about IPv6

2338
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
and how to implement it.

2339
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Now they have IPv6 enabled network

2340
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and queue it up to all parties.

2341
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
They are very concerned

2342
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
that parties would not enable it on their side.

2343
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
In Italy, the law is a bit different.

2344
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:02,399
It is not that everyone should bring

2345
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:05,399
all sorts of routers that are available.

2346
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:08,399
In our case,

2347
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:11,399
all the IPv6 resources are provided

2348
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:14,399
by the operator.

2349
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:17,399
You mean the one that terminates

2350
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,399
on the Ethernet.

2351
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:23,399
I have a router connected to my PC

2352
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:26,399
and I still have PPP OSI

2353
01:22:26,799 --> 01:22:29,799
connected to my brother's CIO.

2354
01:22:29,799 --> 01:22:32,799
I work with Mikrotik.

2355
01:22:32,799 --> 01:22:35,799
Their CPE

2356
01:22:35,799 --> 01:22:38,799
is used as a media converter.

2357
01:22:38,799 --> 01:22:41,799
They realized

2358
01:22:41,799 --> 01:22:44,799
that you can't develop

2359
01:22:44,799 --> 01:22:47,799
your business

2360
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:50,799
only on IPv4.

2361
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,799
If the whole world is on IPv6,

2362
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,200
why wouldn't they go?

2363
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,200
The network is not that big yet.

2364
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,200
What stops us?

2365
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,200
What stops us?

2366
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,200
First of all,

2367
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,200
we are stopped by people

2368
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,200
who are too old

2369
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,200
to understand IPv4.

2370
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,200
They don't want to think about IPv6.

2371
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,600
What stops us is

2372
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,600
that it is not a business case for IPv6.

2373
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,600
For example,

2374
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,599
I don't know what NLB has.

2375
01:23:33,599 --> 01:23:36,599
I'm sorry, XLB.

2376
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:39,599
XLB has a million problems.

2377
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:42,599
IPv6 is not one of them.

2378
01:23:42,599 --> 01:23:45,599
They have 10 internally.

2379
01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:48,599
All people are connected.

2380
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
On Zuni

2381
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
they have a website on IPv4.

2382
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
No operator can guarantee

2383
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
that IPv4 won't support them.

2384
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
You don't have to do anything for them.

2385
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Everything works a little better,

2386
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
but if you look at the replications

2387
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
they give you on mobile phones...

2388
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
For example,

2389
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,400
I was asked

2390
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,400
if I could make a presentation on IPv6.

2391
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,400
I said no,

2392
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,400
it's an old topic.

2393
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,400
I made a new presentation

2394
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,400
on a slightly higher level.

2395
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,400
I simply gave the operators an idea

2396
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,400
of what content providers do.

2397
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,400
The big ones go to the IPv6 only data center.

2398
01:24:43,799 --> 01:24:46,799
Then you have an IPv4 translator on the edge.

2399
01:24:46,799 --> 01:24:49,799
You don't.

2400
01:24:49,799 --> 01:24:52,799
All the big content providers

2401
01:24:52,799 --> 01:24:55,799
have a web server on the edge.

2402
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,799
You have a Zunani interface,

2403
01:24:58,799 --> 01:25:01,799
dual-stack.

2404
01:25:01,799 --> 01:25:04,799
They all have a proxy server.

2405
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:07,799
Yes, they use SIIT,

2406
01:25:07,799 --> 01:25:10,799
and in the other direction something else.

2407
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,200
But the point is...

2408
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,200
Aha, you mean you don't have a dual-stack.

2409
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,200
Yes, I've talked about it a lot

2410
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,200
on Facebook, Google, etc.

2411
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,200
When a meeting ends...

2412
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,200
At a beer.

2413
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,200
I told them how things work.

2414
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Then I said,

2415
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,200
this is a modern content provider.

2416
01:25:38,599 --> 01:25:41,599
And a translator on the edge.

2417
01:25:41,599 --> 01:25:44,599
If we look at the other side

2418
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:47,599
of an operator,

2419
01:25:47,599 --> 01:25:50,599
where you have IPv4, CGN,

2420
01:25:50,599 --> 01:25:53,599
and NAT on CPI,

2421
01:25:53,599 --> 01:25:56,599
let's put it all together.

2422
01:25:56,599 --> 01:25:59,599
You have NNAT, CGN,

2423
01:25:59,599 --> 01:26:02,599
and a translator on the content provider

2424
01:26:02,599 --> 01:26:05,599
before you get to the person.

2425
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Now let's put IPv6.

2426
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
If you implement IPv6,

2427
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
it goes directly,

2428
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
without any additional points,

2429
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
without any additional translations, etc.

2430
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Do you know what was the response of the operators?

2431
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Wow, we've never thought about it like that.

2432
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Of course, because they think about their own money.

2433
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
You know what else?

2434
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,400
With their dual-stack,

2435
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,400
all video traffic goes to IPv6.

2436
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,400
Do you know how much you save on CGN licenses?

2437
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,400
You only save on licenses.

2438
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,400
If you only have CGN,

2439
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,400
you don't have an exit strategy.

2440
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,400
More and more traffic will go to CGN.

2441
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,400
CGN is a carrier-grade NAT.

2442
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,400
If we say NAT is evil,

2443
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,799
it's a carrier-grade evil.

2444
01:27:03,799 --> 01:27:06,799
The operators built it,

2445
01:27:06,799 --> 01:27:09,799
because they didn't have enough IPv6 space.

2446
01:27:09,799 --> 01:27:12,799
They made an additional translation,

2447
01:27:12,799 --> 01:27:15,799
because they used internal IPs.

2448
01:27:15,799 --> 01:27:18,799
Internal IPs between their cores,

2449
01:27:18,799 --> 01:27:21,799
and between your CPUs,

2450
01:27:21,799 --> 01:27:24,799
when it changes to another internal IP,

2451
01:27:24,799 --> 01:27:27,799
or the same one.

2452
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:31,200
Then you have a problem.

2453
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,200
Like you said,

2454
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,200
the operator gives me one word,

2455
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,200
while I have 30 computers at home,

2456
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,200
and I'm fighting for that one word.

2457
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,200
But because the operator was too late,

2458
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,200
and doesn't have one word for me,

2459
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,200
there's one more layer of shit

2460
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,200
before we get to global internet.

2461
01:27:55,599 --> 01:27:58,599
Then you have people

2462
01:27:58,599 --> 01:28:01,599
who are network engineers,

2463
01:28:01,599 --> 01:28:04,599
or network architects.

2464
01:28:04,599 --> 01:28:07,599
The first idea is,

2465
01:28:07,599 --> 01:28:10,599
as long as it works,

2466
01:28:10,599 --> 01:28:13,599
as long as it doesn't extend anywhere.

2467
01:28:13,599 --> 01:28:16,599
No, I have a lot of other work.

2468
01:28:16,599 --> 01:28:19,599
Yes.

2469
01:28:19,599 --> 01:28:22,599
But the difficulty is,

2470
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
because the world is changing,

2471
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
and the other end, the operator,

2472
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
is one end of the communication.

2473
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
For every communication,

2474
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
you need two ends.

2475
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
And the other end changes,

2476
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
because it's cheaper to use IPv6.

2477
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
No, the other end changes,

2478
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
when most of the content is on IPv6.

2479
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And most of the content is on IPv6.

2480
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yes.

2481
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Then you have the long tail of everyone else.

2482
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
99.99% of the domains in the world

2483
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
are on IPv4,

2484
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
because no one cares that they're only on IPv4.

2485
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Unless you're on Cloudflare,

2486
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
then you're automatically on IPv6.

2487
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I think Amazon is already calculating IPv4,

2488
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
so it's IPv4 for service.

2489
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Yes, of course.

2490
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You know what the problem is?

2491
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Amazon will collect the next $2 billion,

2492
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I'll get $12 or $15 a year.

2493
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I'll get $12 or $15 a year.

2494
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to configure IPv6 for that.

2495
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Yes.

2496
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Where's the pain point?

2497
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to configure IPv6 for that.

2498
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
All I need is for you to sign up

2499
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
so that you can start signing up there.

2500
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
No, you know what?

2501
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Then I have to change it on Cloudflare,

2502
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
then I have to change the access list.

2503
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
We're a bit lazy.

2504
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
No, not for $15 a year.

2505
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
At some point, they'll tell you

2506
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
No, they're not going to tell you,

2507
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
they're calculating the pain.

2508
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But look, real experience,

2509
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I've talked to a lot of small operators,

2510
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
who implemented dual stack,

2511
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
today, at the moment,

2512
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
if you're not an IPv6 user,

2513
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
on dual stack,

2514
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
about 50-60% of IPv6 traffic goes like this.

2515
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
That's for fixed IPv6 traffic.

2516
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
For mobile IPv6 traffic,

2517
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
it's 80-90%,

2518
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
because there's only Google and Facebook.

2519
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I don't know if it's still the same for mobile IPv6 traffic.

2520
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
For dual stack, you need 2 SI.

2521
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Yes, PDPv6 and PDPv4.

2522
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
No, you also have dual stack PDP.

2523
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Yes, but you need newer software

2524
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
for the whole network,

2525
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
which almost no one has.

2526
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And you have to pay a license for one user,

2527
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
for two users, because you have 2 SI.

2528
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
That's why T-Mobile USA went to IPv6 only.

2529
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And that's why Lorenzo added Android.

2530
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And what else?

2531
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
464XLAT.

2532
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
The first representative of 464XLAT

2533
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
was in Paris,

2534
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
where I gave Lorenzo a Slovenian SIM card

2535
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
that had IPv6 only.

2536
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And I gave him 15 minutes of my slot,

2537
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
so that Lorenzo came to Oder

2538
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
and we showed 464XLAT on Android for the first time.

2539
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
IPv6 came from France to Slovenia

2540
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
and then to the rest of the world.

2541
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That was interesting.

2542
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
What does IPv6 mean in the end?

2543
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
If, for example,

2544
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
the ideal conditions in the apartment

2545
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
were to switch to IPv6 only,

2546
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
what would fail?

2547
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Where would our current use of the Internet fail?

2548
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
One of the best approaches

2549
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
to implementing IPv6,

2550
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
as I saw them, was Telekom Slovenija.

2551
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
They implemented IPv6 on all dual-stack devices,

2552
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
and instead of enabling it

2553
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
on all users at once,

2554
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
they went like this.

2555
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
No, first they had close users.

2556
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And when we fixed that,

2557
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
they went like this.

2558
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Today, if you enable all users

2559
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
and you get 60% traffic on IPv6,

2560
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
you have no experience with troubleshooting.

2561
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The learning curve is very slow.

2562
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
They went like this.

2563
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
From now on, every new user gets IPv6 by default.

2564
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Anyone who changes something

2565
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
in the self-care portal

2566
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and goes through the same procedure

2567
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
to install something,

2568
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
automatically gets IPv6.

2569
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Or if you go to the portal

2570
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and you want to have IPv6,

2571
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
the learning curve was somewhat positive.

2572
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
And above all,

2573
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
it was manageable.

2574
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
At the same time,

2575
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
we wrote the RIPE document

2576
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
called IPv6 Troubleshooting

2577
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
for Residential Help Desk.

2578
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
We did complete procedures

2579
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
on how help desks test IPv6,

2580
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
do a dual stack,

2581
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
what to do if the user calls

2582
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
and has problems with any of the protocols.

2583
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
My question was,

2584
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
what would be the biggest problem

2585
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
if we were to block IPv6 right now?

2586
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
If you're talking about blocking IPv4

2587
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
there are still a lot of problems

2588
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
with IPv4.

2589
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Either you won't get to those problems,

2590
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
or someone will have to do a translation.

2591
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
What about some applications?

2592
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
In the beginning, Skype 6 was a pain.

2593
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
It's still a pain.

2594
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I mean, it's still working.

2595
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Skype is still working.

2596
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
The hack is,

2597
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
that you have a fake IPv4 interface

2598
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
on every host.

2599
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
That's why Skype connects to it.

2600
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
But because it's a local TCP stack,

2601
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
you can change the TCP size

2602
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
to 6.

2603
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
On the other hand,

2604
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
you have a translator that changes it back to 4.

2605
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Why couldn't T-Mobile

2606
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
fit a 6-only network?

2607
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
It was exactly because of Skype.

2608
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Because everything else was working.

2609
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Until 4.6.4.x came out.

2610
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
After 4.6.4.x came out on Android,

2611
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
they were able to fit a 6-only network.

2612
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I think there were 26 million users

2613
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
on IPv6 only.

2614
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
They called me and said

2615
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
that they had more calls

2616
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
that people wanted to order pizza

2617
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
than IPv6 calls.

2618
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Things are still working.

2619
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Now it's great that Apple

2620
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
finally laid the groundwork

2621
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
and said,

2622
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
that you won't come to the App Store

2623
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
if you don't work on a 6-only network.

2624
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
That's awesome.

2625
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
And now,

2626
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
all the big content providers

2627
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
that have an IPv6-only network

2628
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
and data centers,

2629
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
have found that the happy eyeballs

2630
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
were the best during the week.

2631
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And to make it even better,

2632
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
they decided that more traffic

2633
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
would go through IPv6.

2634
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And they started adding jitters

2635
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
and delays to IPv4 translators

2636
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
on their Edge.

2637
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Now, if you're an IPv4-only user

2638
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and you have a 6-only ISP,

2639
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
your user experience will always be worse.

2640
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
But they don't care.

2641
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
They would rather have a network.

2642
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And those operators

2643
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
that don't think about IPv6 implementation,

2644
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
it would be easier to do it 10 years ago,

2645
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
when there was no content yet.

2646
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
At that time,

2647
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
the flow of everything would be

2648
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
somewhat balanced

2649
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
and all the difficulties would be solved.

2650
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
If you're not an IPv6-only user today,

2651
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
you can get into a disaster.

2652
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You need people who have already started it

2653
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
and have experience in doing it.

2654
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Then it's not a problem.

2655
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
In fact, we are on the right track.

2656
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Operators are covering it well enough.

2657
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Yes.

2658
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
According to global statistics,

2659
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
in certain countries,

2660
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
IPv6 traffic is more than half.

2661
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Google measures traffic

2662
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
on all their devices.

2663
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
And I think that we are now

2664
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
about 50% of traffic on Google

2665
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
comes through IPv6.

2666
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
So it's not a joke anymore.

2667
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Without practice and experience

2668
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
from the world of enterprise

2669
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
and security,

2670
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
IPv6 will disappear.

2671
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
If I'm honest and direct,

2672
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
a certain generation will be able

2673
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
to get a pension

2674
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
before we can implement IPv6.

2675
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It's the same.

2676
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
In theory, one step forward at a time.

2677
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Yes, exactly.

2678
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Let's wrap it up.

2679
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
We have the last 10 minutes.

2680
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
How much time do we have?

2681
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
We are already past 90 minutes.

2682
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I thought we had 20 minutes.

2683
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
You've lost 5 hours.

2684
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
They've limited us.

2685
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Let's try to understand

2686
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
what kind of future

2687
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
is waiting for us.

2688
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
What can we see?

2689
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
It's a very broad question.

2690
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Is it true that

2691
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
IoT, Smart City,

2692
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
will all get their IPs

2693
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
and we will be left with a clusterfuck?

2694
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
That's already a meme.

2695
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Next hype.

2696
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
The problem was that

2697
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
when they hyped 5G,

2698
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
they had to find a hype application

2699
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
to convince all operators

2700
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
why they need 5G.

2701
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
IoT!

2702
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Self-driving cars.

2703
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Wait, wasn't it the same for all four?

2704
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Same, of course it was.

2705
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
What did we say before?

2706
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Every crash will happen again.

2707
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
You need a new frequency,

2708
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
you have to pay for it.

2709
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
You need a new equipment,

2710
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
that's really it.

2711
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
The state chooses frequencies,

2712
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
that's fringe benefits.

2713
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
It's not interesting to vendors,

2714
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
vendors live on new equipment.

2715
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
If you look at it,

2716
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
until the augmented reality,

2717
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
or virtual reality,

2718
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
really comes to life.

2719
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Everything will always go faster,

2720
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
always more, always this,

2721
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
always that.

2722
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But I've had the same speed

2723
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
of an internet connection

2724
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
at home for 10 years.

2725
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
And I don't need anything more.

2726
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
And I don't need anything more.

2727
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I went to look at the statistics,

2728
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
how much I use,

2729
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
and it's sad altogether.

2730
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Yes, I have 100 megabytes,

2731
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
and I don't need more.

2732
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I mean, I wanted to sell 100 megabytes

2733
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
symmetrically, and I said,

2734
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I don't need more, thank you.

2735
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It's a traceable thing,

2736
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
you have a bluetooth toothbrush,

2737
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
that generates a lot of traffic.

2738
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
You were better, you were a liar.

2739
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Wait, I don't understand,

2740
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
why would I need 1 gigabit per second

2741
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
symmetrically on my phone?

2742
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
No, that would be a problem

2743
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
for the phone.

2744
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Another problem,

2745
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I don't want to say it,

2746
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
but we all know it,

2747
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
the phone works by air.

2748
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And air is a shared spectrum.

2749
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And you won't get

2750
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
1 gigabit on your phone

2751
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
until you stand alone

2752
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
under a tree,

2753
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
so that the zombies and everything else

2754
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
will eat you,

2755
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
and the operator is still alive

2756
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
because the internet is still working.

2757
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I remember, we were in Serbia

2758
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
a year ago, the IGF meeting,

2759
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
the Internet Governance Forum,

2760
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
and there were debates about the development

2761
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
of the internet, and there was

2762
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
a woman from the European Commission

2763
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
who came down and said

2764
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
wireless, wireless, wireless,

2765
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
R, R, R.

2766
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And I said,

2767
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
air has its own physical laws,

2768
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
it's a shared media.

2769
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
We won't be able to

2770
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
push it forward,

2771
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
and blow it up,

2772
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
and smoke it,

2773
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
and you know what I said?

2774
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Look, the solution is

2775
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
to take Bulgaria and start digging.

2776
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
And she looked at me in a strange way.

2777
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Yes, but the direction of the European Union

2778
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
is, as soon as

2779
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Bulgaria is in our hands,

2780
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Bulgaria,

2781
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
and if you are in the country,

2782
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
then optically.

2783
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Because in the current optics,

2784
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
sometimes you do it this way,

2785
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
with air, but sometimes you can't do it anymore,

2786
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
because you need a higher frequency,

2787
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
and a higher frequency doesn't go through the window,

2788
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
doesn't go around the wall.

2789
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
How much more will we want to blow up people?

2790
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Well, it's not a problem to blow it up,

2791
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
it's a matter of

2792
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
keeping the power relatively low.

2793
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Not at once.

2794
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
The problem is that it's a line of sight.

2795
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
The problem is that high frequencies

2796
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
can't go into the eye anymore.

2797
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Oh, run, run.

2798
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Look, they're giving it to you.

2799
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
We have a radio material.

2800
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
We will present this

2801
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
for a beer later.

2802
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Do you have any final thoughts?

2803
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Yes, I would say

2804
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
about the development of the Internet,

2805
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
as far as operators are concerned,

2806
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I would say

2807
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
that we should let them

2808
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
deal with new complexities

2809
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
that are intensified by

2810
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
suppliers of equipment and vendors,

2811
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
such as SRV6 and so on.

2812
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Don't curse them.

2813
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Yes, sorry.

2814
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I have to say it once.

2815
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
SRV6, okay.

2816
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Twice.

2817
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And to actively devote

2818
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
to the implementation

2819
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
of IPv6

2820
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
and the development

2821
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
of transport routes

2822
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
and capacity.

2823
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
So that they are connected.

2824
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Automation, right?

2825
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Yes.

2826
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Actually, what I wanted to mention

2827
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
on this topic before,

2828
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
when Deutsche Telekom launched

2829
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
its project called TerraStream.

2830
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
TerraStream, yes.

2831
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Actually, at all the local

2832
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
RIPE meetings,

2833
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
they did a business analysis

2834
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
and concluded that in a few years

2835
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
all their equipment will be lost.

2836
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Meaning, no more cows.

2837
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Have you heard about Peter Lodberg?

2838
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
No.

2839
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
No, another one.

2840
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Peter Lodberg was the father of the project.

2841
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
It was his grandson, I think.

2842
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Yes, and probably he was in Sweden.

2843
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
In English.

2844
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Anyway.

2845
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
The main point is that the margin is not more.

2846
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Focus on how you will

2847
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
reduce the cost of the equipment.

2848
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Because only then will you survive.

2849
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
If you don't reduce the cost of the equipment,

2850
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
there will be another one.

2851
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Cool.

2852
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
The second point for developers is

2853
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
that the laws of physics remain unchanged.

2854
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Latency is not a book.

2855
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Bandwidth is not infinite.

2856
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Even if it's a simple file,

2857
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
you think that's it.

2858
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
We referred to the RFC,

2859
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and we'll talk about it later.

2860
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
If not, we'll talk about physics.

2861
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
We'll talk about SD cards.

2862
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Laws of physics also work for us.

2863
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
If I add,

2864
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
as I said before,

2865
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
for developers,

2866
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
the beating will continue

2867
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
until the morale improves.

2868
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
So, you watched and listened

2869
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
to Ogrodje.

2870
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
With me, Jan Žorš,

2871
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Ivan Poplnjak.

2872
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Thank you very much.

2873
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Did I say anything smart?

2874
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
No.

2875
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Maybe we should repeat it more often.

2876
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I would also like to thank the team

2877
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
behind the camera,

2878
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Patreon,

2879
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
3FSA, Human Frog,

2880
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
and

2881
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
see you next time.
