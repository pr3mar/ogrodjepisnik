00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Welcome to Split Horses Maribor. Today we have a wonderful team of podcasters from Grodno.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Welcome to Split Horses Maribor. Welcome to the first… Today we have a lot of firsts.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today we have the first Split Horses in a wonderful KGB club, mostly in the underground square with microphones and lights in Maribor.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Today is also the first recording of a podcast about Grodno live.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For example. We have already tried it. Qualifying in such clothes and with such colors.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We didn't go that big.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, you didn't go that big.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's say the first recording of a podcast episode this summer.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Absolutely.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's right.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And the first recording of a podcast live on Split Horses. I already mentioned that.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I didn't.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, yes.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Quickly, for those of you who are the first in Split Horses, because I always say that as a moderator of Split Horses.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Split Horses are events about technology, the world and everything in between.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Once a month we get together in our favorite city of Maribor.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We used to get together more often, but look, now we've grown up and we all have an adult life.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We don't have to go somewhere for two weeks, because it already looks so strange.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But yes, I talk a lot, so maybe it would be cool if Andraža could join us.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, no. I mean, first of all, the fact that we are all in this new merch, and maybe even that.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I would like to thank Erne Gračner, who is also...

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Not only does he help us to make the city look as professional as it looks,

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
he is also one of those who are very deserving that Split Horses has been around for 13 years.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So, also for that, Erne, thank you for that.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you for working hard.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do I have to hold this?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, no. You know what, I'll just tell you about the technical briefing.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We have some more points.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
One is that it is satisfactory, it is not regrettable.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Great.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We will try to convey this live.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now, Kadar, we talk to each other.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sometimes I ask very stupid questions.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Not because we don't know, but because we are stupid.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He is simulating the audience.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am not stupid, so you don't have to ask.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
To bring the audience closer.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's what I heard.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We have such a high level of audience that...

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's how it is.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Audience in Grodno.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know. Do you have a structure?

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
At first, I wanted to start with some kind of a rant.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How everything went in Tri Krasne after Covid.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But I said no, we are not there yet.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You will continue.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, definitely.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't want to...

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, no.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Not from the start.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A little.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Slowly, but surely.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So they don't run away.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, no.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They don't.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Where to run?

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Up the hill.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, no, no.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It won't turn out like that.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For all the listeners, viewers, podcasters in Grodno,

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I would like to give you a little background

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
about the connected streets in Maribor.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All of you who live in Ljubljana,

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you are probably very happy,

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
because a lot is happening in Ljubljana,

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
when it comes to technological events.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There is not enough of them in Maribor.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But there are connected streets here.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We are here as a connected member

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
of the technological community in general.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
These are not just topics of pure software development,

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but also topics of design,

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
project, product management.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And yes, the players,

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
who are hiding in the back,

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
are already writing.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They are 13 years old,

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and they are already working.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
As if they don't see it.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But yes, a lot of volunteer work,

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and we are very enthusiastic about it.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I also like to make shoes,

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
so I am front-facing.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you would like to,

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you would move to Ljubljana,

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to the connected streets.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You survived.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We survived, yes.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And what about the connected streets?

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They started in Ljubljana, right?

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, yes.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And is the connected street brand still there?

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
As far as I know,

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
it is a connected side.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know if there are still events.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There was a revival a few years ago,

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
in 2014 or 2014,

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't remember.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I am interested in the community.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How does a community develop,

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
how does a community sustain itself?

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What is this thing?

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How did the garden develop?

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why did the garden sustain itself?

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How it sustains itself,

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we will talk about that later.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But how it develops,

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
we already talked about it.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then you grow up,

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
there are other priorities.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you succeed as a young person,

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
or as a connected member,

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
that will pull you forward?

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If not, everything ends at some point.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And then you conclude.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you conclude?

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
OK.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We are talking about the community as a whole,

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
or specifically?

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
In Grodje,

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will talk about Grodje,

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
but I think we are somewhat similar.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In Grodje,

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
we somehow agreed that

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if you want to do something in Sibinje,

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it is good to have your own audience,

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to know your target audience well,

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
to know who they are,

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to understand their ambitions,

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to understand their problems,

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
what they are facing,

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
what they are thinking about,

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
what works, what doesn't,

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
what language they speak,

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to get to know the people

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
for whom you are doing this.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We tried to make a pool

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
through which we can now

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
celebrate this audience,

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
so that we can gather as many people

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
as possible on one channel,

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
so that we can get this feedback

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
as soon as possible,

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
so that we know who we are working for,

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
so that people tell us

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
whether we did a good job or not,

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and so that they grow together with us.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This helps us a lot,

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
also in the selection in Sibinje,

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
in the promotion in Sibinje,

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and in everything else.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We are working on the pool

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
for two purposes.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
One is that we are doing it for ourselves,

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and the other is that we are doing it

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
for this audience,

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
which I hope we understand

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and which I hope will grow together with us.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can we go on?

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There is more.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This thing with this audience

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
is always interesting to me.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
In my relatively short career,

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have done a lot of different things,

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
but I always deal with people again,

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
although a little more in the technical sense,

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but also with people

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
who are not purely technical.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I always deal with how to translate

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
an idea into something else,

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
so that everyone can understand it.

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What we did very well,

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
in my opinion,

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
haters, you don't have to vote now,

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but what we did very well

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
in all these years,

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
is that we managed to bring together

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
complex or perhaps technically demanding

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
concepts in a much broader way.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is what we are doing now.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We are trying to bring together

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
some concepts in a much broader population,

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
even those who don't need

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
a technical background.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have said it many times,

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and I will probably say it again,

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
but I have been dealing with URIC

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
throughout my career.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If it were not for URIC

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and other events in Maribor,

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I would not know what Ruby on Rails is,

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and I would not have published

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
a book about URIC.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
On the other hand,

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
if it were not for URIC,

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I would not have been in a cage,

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and I would probably have been

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
in a more fancy place.

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can give you an answer to that.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We are moving to Odense.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We have learned that

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
doing too many accessible things

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
does not work.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We have learned that

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
everything we do in ourselves,

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
if you have a full-time employee,

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
for example, you are a full-time employee now,

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
coffee, is that a keyword?

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I am definitely a full-time employee.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I am not a coffeemaker.

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
OK, I got carried away.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If I ask you something serious

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
or if you are going to start for a long time,

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
it will be really hard to explain.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
On the other hand,

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
if people are interested in this,

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
they will find a lot of other content

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that is specifically made for this purpose.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They will find more faith,

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
it will be better explained,

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
it will be explained better,

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
especially for you,

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
maybe with someone else in front of you.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So far we have learned

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
that we are not that intelligent,

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
but simplification does not work

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
for our example.

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We then prepared,

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
maybe this can be a bit

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
for the younger ones,

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
we then prepared that,

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
for example,

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
we need a certain format

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
in the space for individuals,

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
for beginners.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We will make a series of individuals

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
under the banner of Zagon,

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
which is also created and run by our Sarah.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
These individuals are made for beginners

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and try to be individuals for beginners

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
who know how to find themselves

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
in this space,

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
but still with a local note,

246
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
how to prepare CVs,

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
how to pay,

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
how to connect and pay developers,

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
which is something we will investigate.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And this local note for beginners,

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
how to learn to program,

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
what does a programmer do,

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
these are topics that people are looking for

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and I also see that the response is very good

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and it works.

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is probably a bit different

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
for our use case.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Also community,

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
on this note,

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
on Discord we have

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
a channel called Zagon,

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
where more and more beginners

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
are being recruited

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
who experiment,

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
listen,

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and need feedback or help.

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Since so many people are already

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
helping each other,

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it is also very interesting.

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think this is the thing.

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you take,

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
let's say,

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the word community,

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I would say that

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
a large majority of people

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
are regular visitors,

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
or through the fact

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that they came or left,

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
maybe got drunk,

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
met new friends,

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
came to help,

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
as you said,

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
to careers,

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
or to some opportunities

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
that have opened up here.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That is what a community is.

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In fact, it is not only

288
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
that you share a personality

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
but also that a community

290
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
of individuals is growing

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
where everyone starts

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
to create and work together.

293
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So, I don't know,

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
in Grodno,

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
it is also important

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that there is Discord.

297
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It is probably

298
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
a physical space

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and presence,

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
not only that people listen

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
to a lecture and ask questions,

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but also that a debate

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
can develop there.

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That is what is needed,

305
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and that is probably

306
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
what Corona fucked up so well.

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What we forgot

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is the community.

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Online,

310
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't say that

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
in Grodno we notice

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that

313
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the younger generation

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is doing it easier.

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know,

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I am from the generation

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
of Šenoklet,

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and people

319
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
needed to come there.

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That was

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the added value.

322
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Not that a certain personality

323
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
was created there,

324
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
but that people

325
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
were actually

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
hanging out there.

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
One question here,

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because the microphone

329
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
is a bit higher.

330
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is it better now?

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes, it is a bit better,

332
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
isn't it?

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
One thing that interests me

334
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
at this point,

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
is that

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Grodno is a community

337
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
that is a hybrid community,

338
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
if I may say so.

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It is partly live,

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
through the conversations

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you have,

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
every so often.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
At the moment,

344
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Grodno is not organized

345
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
in the form of meetups

346
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
or events like that.

347
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Simply put,

348
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
at the end of the day,

349
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
we have other things,

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
but that is not our ambition.

351
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think that

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Grodno should be exactly that,

353
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Grodno.

354
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There should be a framework

355
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
on which we can build things,

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
there should be a foundation,

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
there should be media and community,

358
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and a channel of audience.

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then we have to

360
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
fully empower

361
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the event organizers,

362
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
who organize meetings,

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Open Blend,

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sektoke, B-sites,

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and everything else.

366
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Andras will tell you

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the story of all those events,

368
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
there is always someone

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
who says, fuck, I know it better.

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And he is right.

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And then Slovenia...

372
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Slovenian, I know it better.

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I did it myself.

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And then there are meetings,

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and then we come to the point

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
where they say, hey,

377
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Otto, what if you did a gift

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and collected all the dates

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
so that we wouldn't organize the event

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
on the same day,

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
because that is already happening

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in Ljubljana,

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that you have very big, powerful events

384
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
on the same day.

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think that in Slovenia,

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the space is for everything,

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and if you look at it,

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
those scales are still small.

389
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There is a gap

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
in how much these things can grow,

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and that gap is not very big.

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And I think

393
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
what we are aiming for

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and what we are doing this year

395
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
is that we have

396
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
a couple of events

397
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
where we are connected with the organizers,

398
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and they have events

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that we publish on our channels,

400
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and in this way we present it to our audience,

401
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and it is a win-win situation

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
for the organizers and for our audience,

403
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
because we know that they are interested

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in these things,

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and it is logical that people come.

406
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Also, for example,

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I have a sponsor here, 3FSE,

408
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
they organize a Kubernetes meetup,

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
we promoted it,

410
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and I think that tomorrow

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
about 18 people will come.

412
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think that is our role.

413
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Last year we also partnered

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
with Dragonhack,

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
ADA,

416
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and many other events.

417
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We want to create

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
a community

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and create a channel

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
for these events.

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We are also present

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
at these events,

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
we also broadcast,

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and we will come back,

425
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
because this is where

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
the offline happens,

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
as Andras said.

428
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Do you think

429
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
that maybe

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
there is an expansion

431
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and contraction of these events

432
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and meetups?

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
For example, in Maribor,

434
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I remember that a few years ago

435
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
we had a huge meetup.

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It was this meetup,

437
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and then at one point

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
people lost their way,

439
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and they didn't have time,

440
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and there were children,

441
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and other services,

442
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and then

443
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
people lost their way,

444
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
which is often the case

445
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
in our industry.

446
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What can we do

447
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
to make it

448
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
as sustainable as possible?

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think that

450
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the most you can do is

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to go and see

452
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
who organizes it.

453
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you are an expert

454
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
in a topic,

455
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
if you go as a teacher,

456
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it means a lot to people.

457
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
People organize,

458
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and the more events,

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the better.

460
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
People learn

461
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
how to organize.

462
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It looks very simple on the surface,

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
but when you have three guys

464
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
with three microphones,

465
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
how much communication

466
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
is needed to happen?

467
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I think we have to

468
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
move forward,

469
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but it's better

470
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
if they are powerful,

471
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
because if people come together...

472
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's what I wanted to say.

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's more about

474
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
lack of cooperation.

475
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If there was more

476
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
cooperation,

477
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and I will say

478
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
that because of the fence

479
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
there is more cooperation,

480
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but I see that

481
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
there is more cooperation.

482
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If there was more cooperation,

483
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
there would be

484
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
more meetups,

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and the community

486
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
would grow more.

487
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
There would be less burnout.

488
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
On the other hand,

489
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
when a meetup

490
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
starts,

491
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
maybe

492
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the ego goes away.

493
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I can do it,

494
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I believe I can,

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
but we have seen

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that if you do it once or twice,

497
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
you don't succeed.

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's more about

499
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
how to motivate

500
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
other people to help you.

501
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
How do you

502
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
motivate

503
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
someone

504
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to help you?

505
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It may not be perfect,

506
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
but it's

507
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
a learning process.

508
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Let's start with Asano.

509
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, Asano is not for me.

510
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I get a flashback

511
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
to Asano.

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm glad you mentioned it,

513
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
because it's one thing

514
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that we encounter

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
at meetups.

516
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Maribor is not

517
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
a huge city.

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Maribor has a tech community,

519
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
but it's not

520
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
as developed

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
as Ljubljana

522
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
or any other city.

523
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't think

524
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that's a problem.

525
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
If you think

526
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
that people will come to you

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and ask for sponsorship,

528
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
it's hard.

529
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There were times

530
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
when we had 4 sponsors

531
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and everyone was fighting

532
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
who will get pizza, cookies,

533
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
caps, everything.

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It was a way

535
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
to get

536
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
to that kind of people

537
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and to support them

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
with business interests.

539
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But now

540
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
everyone is fighting

541
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and it's a crisis.

542
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's hard

543
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
to find someone

544
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and a sponsor.

545
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can be disappointed.

546
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We don't have a sponsor,

547
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but we have supporters.

548
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If you want

549
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
some organizational freedom,

550
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and you want

551
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to choose a topic yourself,

552
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
or if you will invite

553
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
some partners,

554
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
you can be careful

555
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that they won't influence

556
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the choice of guests,

557
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so HR won't take

558
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
your event and

559
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
recruit you.

560
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We witnessed that

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
many times.

562
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There's no free money.

563
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
People who come

564
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to events

565
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
don't have to pay

566
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
for a beer.

567
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's hard

568
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
to get funding

569
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
in Slovenia.

570
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I think people are

571
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
more responsible than

572
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
in the past.

573
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I agree.

574
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's a cycle of ups and downs.

575
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There are times

576
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
when it's easier

577
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
to make a name for yourself,

578
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
or when it's already

579
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
done.

580
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Then it's easier.

581
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But then

582
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
you think you're

583
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
behind the wheel,

584
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and next year

585
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
you're not

586
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
a part of it anymore.

587
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The same people

588
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
don't give you money anymore.

589
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's interesting to me

590
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that many events

591
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
from the 80s

592
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
to the 90s

593
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
were based on two principles.

594
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Either it was purely

595
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
punk DIY,

596
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
where everyone gets

597
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
a beer every other Thursday

598
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and we talk about

599
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
some topics,

600
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
or we go to

601
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
a formal structure,

602
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
an organization, etc.

603
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Splitnavice is an example

604
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
of a punk DIY.

605
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You say that,

606
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
but I didn't say no.

607
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We are structured.

608
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes, we are structured.

609
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But that's punk.

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
We were very lucky

611
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to have

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
very good friends

613
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and supporters

614
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
in Kibla,

615
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
the National House.

616
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
They were always there

617
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
for us,

618
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
they promoted ZDV,

619
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and for two weeks

620
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
we organized events.

621
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It was insane.

622
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The Splitnavice team

623
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
is here right now.

624
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It was

625
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
machinery.

626
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
People went to Maribor

627
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
constantly,

628
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
everyone could see everything.

629
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
From specific events

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
like

631
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
coffee,

632
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
blockchain,

633
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
to some simple

634
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
topics,

635
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't have to use the word

636
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
simple, because nothing is simple,

637
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
to some general topics

638
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
like how to find

639
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
your first job in IT,

640
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
or design topics.

641
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Design topics are

642
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
very important.

643
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
for some reason, underrepresented

644
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
in general,

645
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
project, product management.

646
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
When we started

647
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
developing these tasks,

648
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and when we started developing this program,

649
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
the DIY mindset,

650
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the punk mindset,

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
got us to this point.

652
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
We had

653
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
low operating costs,

654
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
which were practically nothing,

655
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
a lot of people didn't get paid

656
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
or anything, so we hid

657
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and it went through

658
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
for a long time.

659
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Then came the corona,

660
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
then we all locked ourselves in our rooms.

661
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But you had some

662
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
kind of flow as well.

663
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It was very visible,

664
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
when Slovenia was closing down.

665
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
At the same time,

666
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
there were rare cases,

667
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
which were published daily,

668
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
you came, there was a channel, stream, talk,

669
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
very proper level.

670
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Where are you at the same time?

671
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
There is also an archive in Spetni Hurice,

672
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
at the same time.

673
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's very interesting.

674
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
There are a lot of things.

675
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But all of this takes a long time,

676
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
especially for people.

677
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We took a break one day,

678
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
then we called him back,

679
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and he was gone for a month.

680
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And that was it?

681
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That was it.

682
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No, poor genetics.

683
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Spetni Hurice.

684
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But yes,

685
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
events like ours,

686
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the basis is that

687
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
it's live,

688
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
with people in front of the audience.

689
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And live events have their own dimension,

690
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
their own challenges,

691
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and their own specifics.

692
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Correct me if I'm wrong,

693
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
or I'm interested in your opinion,

694
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
what do you see as an advantage

695
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
of live events?

696
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I see it like this.

697
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What I've noticed in those meetups,

698
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
is that 40%

699
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
is a person,

700
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
60% is the audience.

701
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And from the perspective of someone

702
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
who organizes the event,

703
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
you have to focus.

704
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I see the guests,

705
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
everything has to be perfect.

706
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then the other 60%,

707
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
when the lights go out,

708
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you have to find out who will

709
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
help organize the event,

710
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
who will speak,

711
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
who will delegate.

712
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You have to work very actively

713
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
so that the next event

714
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
will happen while you're there.

715
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He's laughing now.

716
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Andras, can you tell us about

717
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Sektok?

718
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I can tell you,

719
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't know how it is in CyberPipa,

720
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
but I have to

721
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
imagine

722
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
that CyberPipa

723
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
produced

724
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
only three events

725
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
a week.

726
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That's a lot.

727
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
These are three events a week.

728
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There were four,

729
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
so four days a week

730
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
were events.

731
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And in one month

732
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
you had to know exactly what will happen

733
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
because the flyers were printed.

734
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There was no internet.

735
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
How sick is that?

736
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You could have

737
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
a salesperson,

738
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you could have known

739
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
that you can print flyers

740
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
for the next month.

741
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Andras, what are flyers?

742
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I mean,

743
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
in an analog form,

744
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
a sheet of paper

745
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
on which the program

746
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
for the next month was written.

747
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
A flyer.

748
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I was

749
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
actively

750
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
leading

751
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
these events.

752
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
What did I do

753
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to make it possible?

754
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't know.

755
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm trying to put one meetup

756
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
a month in the hallway

757
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and it really needs to be

758
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
postponed.

759
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What is it?

760
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't know.

761
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The audience here

762
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
looks very simple.

763
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
They send e-mails.

764
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The meetup will be there.

765
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's not that simple.

766
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Even the copy

767
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that needs to be printed

768
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
with 3-4 flyers

769
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
will take

770
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
one hour.

771
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Then the image,

772
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and so on.

773
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You lose

774
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
some time.

775
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's not that simple.

776
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I agree with what

777
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the author said.

778
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You probably

779
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
haven't noticed

780
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
but the idea is

781
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
that people are there.

782
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
What do you do with these people?

783
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm from the generation

784
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that says

785
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
that the video stream

786
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
kills the event.

787
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
In CyberPipa,

788
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
we were in a phase

789
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
where the stream was fine.

790
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
If someone had an idea,

791
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
how to stream

792
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and the stream appeared,

793
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
but somehow

794
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
people got mad.

795
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
They were like,

796
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
how come there's no stream today?

797
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It happened once

798
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
that we stopped people

799
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
on the street

800
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and asked them

801
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
when the last stream will be.

802
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It wasn't in Kibla

803
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
or in Kamesov Pisarnik

804
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
where we have events now.

805
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I was working on something

806
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and I was like,

807
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
sorry.

808
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Streams are great

809
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but there's one more level of complexity.

810
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Especially that we set up

811
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
everything here.

812
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
At this point,

813
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
we wouldn't sell the audience

814
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
here.

815
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But with the garden

816
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and with the story

817
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that Andras is telling,

818
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
it's very simple

819
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
to add features

820
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and complexity

821
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
to the events

822
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and to increase

823
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the expectations

824
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
of the audience

825
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and the people

826
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
who attend the events.

827
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's easier

828
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
to add lights

829
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and cameras

830
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
when at some point

831
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
you say,

832
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
let's go back.

833
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Now we had streaming

834
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and we won't have it anymore.

835
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Don't you have to

836
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
force yourself to go back

837
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
or do you have a feeling

838
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that the audience won't

839
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
notice it?

840
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What can we do

841
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
to make it a new standard

842
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and to bring it back?

843
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Because then you start thinking

844
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
that

845
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
it's at this level.

846
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You have to realize

847
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
that we do this

848
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
to a large extent

849
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
because we like it.

850
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We like it so much

851
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that we do it freely.

852
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
In such a mindset,

853
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
people can be easily

854
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
exploited.

855
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The whole music industry

856
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
works on this concept.

857
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
People are passionate

858
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and are ready to commit

859
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to anything.

860
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
This leads to

861
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
excitement,

862
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
to expectations

863
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that you don't have to keep.

864
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
As you said,

865
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
we have a live event

866
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
in Grodno.

867
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It would be an additional

868
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
part of everything

869
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
we have to do.

870
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
If we find someone

871
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to delegate it,

872
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
we can't replace

873
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
or compensate for it.

874
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What do you mean?

875
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I mean,

876
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
it could be a shout-out.

877
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
If someone is interested

878
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
in experimenting

879
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and would like to

880
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
get involved

881
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and stream live,

882
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
we won't.

883
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Will you complain?

884
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What if there were...

885
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You see, that's where it starts.

886
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What if there were...

887
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You know what you could do?

888
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's pure Maribor.

889
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You know what you could do?

890
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You could switch to Turkish.

891
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Those who don't visit you

892
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and don't listen to you

893
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
always tell you that.

894
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
They didn't follow you,

895
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
but they suggest what to do.

896
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You could have headphones,

897
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
even better microphones,

898
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
you could stream,

899
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
you could...

900
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You know Patreon?

901
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh, you know,

902
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I have a low salary in Switzerland.

903
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Some of those initiatives,

904
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
like Grodno,

905
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Spletna Urica,

906
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
various meet-ups,

907
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
are only for those

908
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
who come from common enthusiasm

909
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and common interest.

910
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It grows.

911
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It grows a lot.

912
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I would say that everything

913
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
comes from one individual

914
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
who is crazy enough

915
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to do it.

916
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah, definitely.

917
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Andras Raga.

918
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Those social activities

919
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
are forming a lot

920
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and we are finding them now.

921
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You still need some space

922
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
to organize an event,

923
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
you need a way

924
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
to communicate with people.

925
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I would go back a bit.

926
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I often use

927
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
this Slovenian proverb

928
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and it goes like this.

929
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
A good farmer

930
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
finds a good heir.

931
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's a very deep

932
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
thought.

933
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
We are not good at that.

934
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We are not good at that.

935
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
We are still working on that.

936
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's a theory

937
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
about the Slovenian proverb.

938
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We are not good at that.

939
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
If we want

940
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Grodno to survive

941
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
5-10 years,

942
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
we need to

943
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
structure it in such a way

944
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that it will be resilient.

945
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
If I am sick today,

946
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
or Andras is sick,

947
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
we need to rotate

948
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and take care of him.

949
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
We need to think

950
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
about that.

951
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We are also working on

952
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
how to

953
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
mix different parts,

954
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
so the torch

955
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
will be

956
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
thrown forward.

957
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But it's not like

958
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
here are the keys.

959
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You need to somehow...

960
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I would say yes.

961
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That's a nice

962
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
proverb.

963
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I would add

964
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
that I allow

965
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
anyone to take

966
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
the torch

967
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and turn it

968
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
in a different direction.

969
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I mean,

970
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
whether it's a wedding

971
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
or a meet-up,

972
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
whether it's in Grodno,

973
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
those who

974
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
carry it forward,

975
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
they carry it with their vision.

976
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They keep the skeleton

977
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
and decide

978
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
whether to change

979
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
specific content

980
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
or just change the torch.

981
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That's something

982
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
that is a bit

983
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
purely Slovenian.

984
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I remembered it,

985
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
it's my project,

986
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and the successor would like

987
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
it a bit differently,

988
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
so I won't let it go.

989
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We need to leave the ego aside.

990
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Someone calmed down,

991
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
someone thought

992
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
to turn it in a different direction.

993
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It sounds much simpler,

994
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
but to build

995
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
a climate

996
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
where

997
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
you can screw up.

998
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
We'll do something

999
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
we'll screw up,

1000
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
it'll be a disaster,

1001
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
but we'll learn

1002
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and turn it in a different direction.

1003
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes, but here's the problem.

1004
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
If you screw up and learn...

1005
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Are you talking about me?

1006
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Maybe, maybe.

1007
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Then it becomes

1008
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
that no matter how much

1009
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
you learn,

1010
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
we've learned something.

1011
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
A person has to go through

1012
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
the same mistakes

1013
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and learn something new

1014
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
again.

1015
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes, that's why

1016
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
in Grodno we don't have

1017
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
a recording studio.

1018
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We've organized a recording

1019
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
in a cafe.

1020
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You learn from some things.

1021
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Maybe that's also

1022
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
important,

1023
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
if we've ever organized

1024
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
anything like that,

1025
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the reflection after the event

1026
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
is very important.

1027
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
When we record,

1028
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
we talk about what was good,

1029
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
what wasn't.

1030
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Maybe it's not like that,

1031
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
but we've learned

1032
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
what suits us.

1033
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That reflection,

1034
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
retro,

1035
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
is very important

1036
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
because you need a point

1037
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
to say,

1038
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
is this what we're fighting for?

1039
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
If you have those points,

1040
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
it's less likely

1041
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
that you'll lose

1042
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
what you're fighting for.

1043
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I like that, because

1044
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
it could be applied

1045
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
to everything.

1046
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
We do everything

1047
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
based on what we've already done.

1048
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
What did Loki do in CyberPip?

1049
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What did the players do in Design?

1050
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
What did we do?

1051
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And then we learn a lot.

1052
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Certain things can be re-recorded,

1053
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
certain things

1054
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
don't exist anymore

1055
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
in 2020,

1056
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
but you have to try different things.

1057
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's true.

1058
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I see that

1059
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
even when there are live events,

1060
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
we have to try

1061
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
to keep people on their toes

1062
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and to develop the debate.

1063
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
A few years ago,

1064
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
it was something normal.

1065
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I had this forum

1066
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
at Pipini Expert

1067
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
where we know

1068
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that the Slovenian audience

1069
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
didn't stop asking questions.

1070
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
There was a good flow of people

1071
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
who invested a lot of time

1072
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and in the end,

1073
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
zero questions.

1074
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Or there's always

1075
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
one person who asks

1076
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
the most fucking questions

1077
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and the most discussion in the world.

1078
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That's what I did.

1079
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I had a lot of questions

1080
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and I provoked

1081
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
the audience and someone

1082
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
so that in the end

1083
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I put a lot of questions

1084
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
in front of the audience

1085
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
because they said

1086
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
that they would ask me

1087
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
the same questions.

1088
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Just because I provoked

1089
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the audience to start asking

1090
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
questions.

1091
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
A little trick of a great master.

1092
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Are we going to include

1093
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
questions from the audience?

1094
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
We will.

1095
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You know what,

1096
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
we could tell our sponsors

1097
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and supporters.

1098
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Is that you?

1099
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
No, that's your part.

1100
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Here we have in Grodno

1101
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
we thank the 3FSE

1102
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and Human Frog

1103
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
who support us

1104
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
in this story.

1105
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We thank all the Patreons

1106
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
who support us.

1107
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Patreonite, besides

1108
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
getting a person before

1109
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
also got a merch

1110
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
which was also made by Mr. Gračan.

1111
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Thank you for your support.

1112
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
EPP.

1113
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Now we have

1114
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
a few more questions.

1115
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It would be cool to include them.

1116
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Are you ready?

1117
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Did he choose me?

1118
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Ok.

1119
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Did you choose the first question?

1120
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Why don't we have a 8K

1121
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
video podcast?

1122
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Jan,

1123
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
are you going to start

1124
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
We don't have a disk.

1125
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
We don't have a storage disk.

1126
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes, that's a problem.

1127
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yes, those SD cards.

1128
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We are fully limited,

1129
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
so it's better to have episodes

1130
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
after 20 minutes.

1131
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If we would do it in 8K,

1132
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
if I'm right,

1133
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Jan's answer is that

1134
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
there would be an episode

1135
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
of 100 GB.

1136
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I think that would be

1137
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
too much.

1138
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
A lot of people are using the internet,

1139
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
so they don't have a problem with 100 GB.

1140
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I already have

1141
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
a portable SSD disk

1142
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
M-tera for 90 euros.

1143
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You can put it in your pocket

1144
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and save it.

1145
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think there are

1146
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
some other technical issues.

1147
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Jan said that

1148
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
if you are interested in why we don't have a 8K

1149
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
in the back,

1150
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
the audience is waiting for you.

1151
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
We will discuss the details of that in a bit.

1152
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Video production

1153
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
costs $1 and $1.00 per hour.

1154
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
To make it look

1155
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and sound proper

1156
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
is absolutely one thing.

1157
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Thank you, Jan, for everything.

1158
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It also means that we can

1159
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
get along with everyone else.

1160
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Tomaš should also join us,

1161
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
because Lightning is also important.

1162
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes.

1163
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Tomaš Zaman is the bringer of light.

1164
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Tomaš Zaman is the bringer of light

1165
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
from Kobilje.

1166
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
We thank him a lot.

1167
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
He is the real YouTuber

1168
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
from all of us.

1169
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
A random interlude.

1170
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
If any of you

1171
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
are involved in event organization,

1172
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
you know that the person

1173
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
who forms the light

1174
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
usually sits behind the table and watches.

1175
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Those who are involved in event organization

1176
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
are like,

1177
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
oh no, there is a photo,

1178
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and physicists are jumping around.

1179
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Shall we move on?

1180
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Yes, let's move on.

1181
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Because people could go crazy.

1182
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
They can go.

1183
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
We still have some problems.

1184
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We have to deal with them.

1185
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You can go crazy,

1186
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
but technically speaking,

1187
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
they are recording everything.

1188
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
How long does it take you

1189
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
post-production or video editing?

1190
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
How do you publish a new video

1191
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
on all platforms? Do you have your app

1192
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
or do you use a third party app?

1193
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
This is a really interesting question.

1194
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
How long does it take us

1195
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
video editing?

1196
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
We will record this,

1197
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I have it all on a disk,

1198
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and I will bring it home,

1199
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and when I have time, I will edit it.

1200
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It usually takes 7 days.

1201
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It depends on how busy you are.

1202
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We don't press any buttons.

1203
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It is an artistic work.

1204
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It is an artistic work.

1205
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It is an artistic work.

1206
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It is an artistic work.

1207
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
We send it, and then we publish it.

1208
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You said that it is fully post-production.

1209
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Post-production is...

1210
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Post-production is

1211
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
just putting in

1212
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
this audio program, normalizing it

1213
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
to minus 3 decibels.

1214
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
No, no, no. Hired.

1215
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Hired?

1216
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We have already learned

1217
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that this doesn't work.

1218
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We have Jan, who knows this.

1219
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Once we had AI tools.

1220
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You put this in, and then AI tools.

1221
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Then you say, now it will be a perfect sound.

1222
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
No.

1223
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I would say, everything is fine.

1224
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
He said, no.

1225
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
A YouTube commenter once said,

1226
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
when you put it in AI tools,

1227
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
it doesn't work.

1228
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Jan looked at it and said,

1229
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
fans, before you put it in AI tools,

1230
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
you should worry about stereo recording,

1231
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
not mono.

1232
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Why do you publish it?

1233
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
OK, the publisher of the podcast

1234
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
is Fordhamis.

1235
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
There is a platform

1236
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
called Podcaster,

1237
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
which was bought by Spotify.

1238
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You put a file on top,

1239
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
and then it does an RSS feed.

1240
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Then we have it posted

1241
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
on all the other platforms,

1242
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
like Apple and Insta,

1243
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and from that RSS,

1244
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
YouTube chooses.

1245
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Then you publish it on top,

1246
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and that's it.

1247
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
On those two channels,

1248
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
we publish the audio recordings.

1249
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
We also have a developer, CMS,

1250
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
technical.

1251
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You can see that this is a technological podcast,

1252
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
because someone has always been developing

1253
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
their own CMS.

1254
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Integrate, integrate, integrate.

1255
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's how it started.

1256
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Maybe it sounds stupid,

1257
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
but that's how it is today.

1258
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
From CMS, we have a page generated,

1259
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and everything is stretched and structured,

1260
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and thumbnails can also be created.

1261
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So, stay tuned

1262
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
on our GitHub and open source.

1263
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
If anyone is interested in this technological aspect,

1264
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
we are on Skriberi.

1265
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
On the other hand,

1266
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
what we are most successful at

1267
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
is getting people to use it themselves.

1268
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
We were at that point

1269
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
where we needed a ticketing system.

1270
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And then,

1271
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Slovenia decided to write their own.

1272
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yes, yes.

1273
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And then I said,

1274
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
there are a lot of them,

1275
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
but not Jira, but something else.

1276
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I get PTSD every two seconds.

1277
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Only if it's integrated.

1278
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Only if it's integrated, right?

1279
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yes, that would interest them.

1280
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
On GitHub,

1281
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
we have everything written.

1282
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
If anyone is interested,

1283
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
if anyone wants to clone,

1284
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
they can make their own podcast.

1285
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yes, go for it.

1286
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
In the community,

1287
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
we touched on everything.

1288
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Questions for the older generation.

1289
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, my God.

1290
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
What are the current meetups,

1291
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
conferences and similar events

1292
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
starting better than the previous ones,

1293
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
for example, 10 years ago?

1294
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
What are we doing better today?

1295
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Definitely,

1296
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
more omnipresent

1297
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
on the Internet.

1298
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
On all possible channels,

1299
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
but also,

1300
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
as you said,

1301
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
there are all these different tools

1302
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
that are being generated,

1303
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
sent, etc.

1304
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
What is being done worse?

1305
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
That might be more interesting to me.

1306
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
There is less honest contact

1307
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
between people on events.

1308
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I don't know.

1309
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I mean,

1310
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
if I go to our side,

1311
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
we started collaborating

1312
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
with Laro Kozbek this year.

1313
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
If it wasn't in Portuguese,

1314
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
it would probably be with us.

1315
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And now we have

1316
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
a member in our team

1317
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
who manages to distribute

1318
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
the gifts on TikTok,

1319
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
YouTube, Reels

1320
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and Instagram.

1321
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We can see that there are

1322
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
a lot of audiences

1323
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
and we have to be present.

1324
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It's our format,

1325
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
so if you see the clips,

1326
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Laro does it all by himself

1327
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and spreads it.

1328
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
We make sure that people

1329
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
who don't know us see us.

1330
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Facebook is for old people

1331
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and LinkedIn is for business.

1332
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
What if I say I don't have a Facebook?

1333
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You have to do it,

1334
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
but if you really want

1335
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
to be present

1336
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
on LinkedIn and Facebook,

1337
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
you will be able to do it.

1338
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You will be able to buy ads

1339
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and then come back

1340
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
to it quickly.

1341
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You can do it today

1342
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
as an event organizer.

1343
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
In our case,

1344
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
we built

1345
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
all this presence

1346
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
for nothing.

1347
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
We never bought

1348
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
new ads or anything.

1349
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Everything through our own networks

1350
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and that was enough.

1351
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,280
How far can we go with this effect?

1352
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:20,240
You definitely get to know each other before 2-8 events and after that you have a chance to get an audience.

1353
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,799
You can try a little bit, but you have social networks, you have a lot of things,

1354
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:30,000
as I said before, airplanes, press of airplanes, there was nothing else.

1355
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,400
On the other hand, if there was RSS, it was already a step forward, there were very few aggregators,

1356
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:43,200
there were no Facebooks, Myspace existed, and that was it.

1357
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,160
In fact, this word is not a lie today.

1358
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,639
But it's not a lie either, is it?

1359
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,080
It's not a lie because you can work harder for the attention of those people.

1360
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:04,879
It's not enough to launch something, but in some smart way you will launch it so that you will target the right people.

1361
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:21,519
But I would say that this part of honest contact, or actually building a community with people who really come to the event,

1362
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:26,320
to shake hands a little bit, or to get to know each other, that's what it's all about.

1363
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:39,120
I see that everyone you meet at such an event and you get to onboard them by hand, stays there forever.

1364
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:48,080
One of the things in our Discord is that people who came in, if we onboarded them by hand,

1365
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:53,680
they are full of passion and they felt it today because they understand these issues.

1366
00:51:54,639 --> 00:52:05,360
So, this personal touch, communities are people, we can all have some titles, techniques, voices and everything,

1367
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,479
but that's the touch you build with people.

1368
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:11,520
And also, if you want to, I have a question here,

1369
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:17,679
bring some commercial business, because you will work with people.

1370
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:26,800
I think it's all the same, the level is higher or different, but you will probably be able to maintain the business,

1371
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,000
and it's not enough to do it once and then hope that you got it all.

1372
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,399
Ok, I have one here, who wrote this to me?

1373
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:47,279
How to motivate young people who will help maintain and continue the Smiley Face community in Switzerland?

1374
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:54,240
One of the debates we had last year with Blengorjev, where do you find young people?

1375
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:01,119
In cafés, at basketball courts, so random that we get together in Maribor for a few years.

1376
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:11,839
I prepare one thing, I work a lot with young people and I'm in some different initiatives,

1377
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:18,880
I'm not a stand-up comedian, I'm not an improviser, I'm not an economist,

1378
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
Ok, that's enough.

1379
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:35,199
I see that a lot of young people have a desire to be part of a story, something bigger,

1380
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:42,080
but they often have a problem because they don't know how to take the first step,

1381
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:48,639
how to join an initiative, a lot of times there is no onboarding,

1382
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:55,199
you come, you find someone, and if you are lucky, someone will take you under their wing and show you things,

1383
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:01,679
and then you start to learn, you meet new people,

1384
00:54:01,759 --> 00:54:08,240
but a lot of times it's a problem because people don't have a structured approach.

1385
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,759
For example, in Urec, we had a lot of students who came to help us,

1386
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:20,239
they helped with filming, photographing, organizing events,

1387
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:26,640
and it's not hard to start an event like that, you need a space where people will gather,

1388
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:33,040
you need a topic to talk about, you need someone who will say something about that topic,

1389
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:41,040
and you just need to make sure that the conditions for dissemination of information are as comfortable as possible.

1390
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,799
Yes, there is a light, maybe a microphone, or that everything is so quiet that you can hear it, and so on.

1391
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,440
Nobody sees all the other things that are happening.

1392
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:57,839
You need to prepare tables, you need to prepare cables on the left and right,

1393
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,359
and there is a lot of hidden work.

1394
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:07,279
A lot of young people are under the impression that this is ready-made,

1395
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:11,760
I come, I sit down, and suddenly things start to work on their own.

1396
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,519
Where do I find young people who have so many desires?

1397
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:23,920
It's very hard to find them, and when you do, you have to do everything in your power to keep them.

1398
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:31,119
Which is a big problem, because young people, or people who have some special characteristics,

1399
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,079
or predispositions, characteristics,

1400
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,279
they are very curious, and they do six different things at the same time.

1401
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:43,760
And you compete now for these six other interests in their lives.

1402
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,559
Sometimes you succeed, sometimes you don't, and then people move,

1403
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,760
then they have jobs, then they have children, and so on.

1404
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,440
I don't know if you like to have a structured approach to looking for these young people,

1405
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,920
great, but it takes a lot of resources.

1406
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,920
If you don't have cash, time and energy.

1407
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,799
If you don't have time and energy, you can supplement it with cash.

1408
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:12,559
It's not a simple answer, it's a very difficult topic.

1409
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,839
Who is this guy? I can talk to him for three hours, I don't know who he is.

1410
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,720
If I remember correctly, at the beginning of Cyberpipa,

1411
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,239
there was a period when the broadband wasn't very widespread.

1412
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:39,600
So if you had a good ISD at home, or the beginning of some kind of XDSL, great.

1413
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:48,239
But in reality, we had the most equipment available at the time.

1414
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,959
So there was a lot of interest, people had fast internet,

1415
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:56,399
and there was a lot of equipment that you don't have at home.

1416
00:56:56,399 --> 00:57:02,640
So you got a group of people who could hang out there.

1417
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,640
Now the question is, how did you...

1418
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,679
Yes, a lot of people became very motivated because of that,

1419
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,760
and they wanted to do something.

1420
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
Today we have this problem,

1421
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,760
when generations come and say,

1422
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
look, we have faster internet at home,

1423
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,760
I have a powerbook at home,

1424
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,760
which you don't have here.

1425
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,760
Why would I go to you?

1426
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,760
When there was a period,

1427
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,760
I don't know, 3D printers,

1428
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,760
we had a 3D printer, great.

1429
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,760
Today you have a 3D printer at home,

1430
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
why would you hang out with someone?

1431
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
But this hasn't changed from...

1432
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,760
I don't know,

1433
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,839
before 2008.

1434
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,839
In Ljubljana, for example,

1435
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,839
Ljubljana Tech Hub,

1436
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,839
events there...

1437
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,839
Ljubljana Tech Hub, what's that?

1438
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,839
You have old news.

1439
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,839
It's not Ljubljana Tech Hub anymore?

1440
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,839
I mean, that news hasn't come from Trojana yet.

1441
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,839
No, I didn't...

1442
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,839
You'll have more beer then.

1443
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,839
Ah, OK.

1444
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,839
The last time I was at an event there,

1445
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,839
it was more equipped than the Marsekater Hall

1446
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,839
in Prijeditven Prostor in Slovenia.

1447
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,920
That's what we were talking about earlier.

1448
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,920
It's very simple,

1449
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,920
it's hard to be consistent

1450
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,920
through time.

1451
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,920
If you start at a high level,

1452
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,920
you can't...

1453
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,920
It's not sustainable.

1454
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,920
In Grodno,

1455
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,920
it's a third or fourth attempt

1456
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,920
to have a technical podcast

1457
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
or a tech-deo podcast

1458
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,920
in Slovenia.

1459
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,920
People have

1460
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
even better microphones

1461
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
than we have.

1462
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
They're just microphones

1463
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
because

1464
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
you need a lot of other things

1465
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that are important

1466
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and you need continuity.

1467
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Exactly.

1468
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's easy

1469
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
to buy gear

1470
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
because of the equipment.

1471
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But

1472
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
if I just go forward,

1473
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
it's more likely

1474
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that if you create

1475
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,080
comfortable physical conditions

1476
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,080
for an initiative,

1477
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,080
you'll attract people's attention.

1478
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,080
But it's not necessary

1479
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,080
to attract people's attention.

1480
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,080
I won't go too deep

1481
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,080
into details,

1482
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,080
but the cyberpipa

1483
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,080
that lost its space

1484
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,080
somehow

1485
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,080
sank or disappeared.

1486
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,080
People started to say

1487
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,159
that they don't have space

1488
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:32,159
or a place to start.

1489
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:34,159
Then they realized

1490
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:36,159
that in order to have

1491
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,159
their own existence,

1492
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:40,159
they need space.

1493
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,159
Then they found

1494
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,159
an unoccupied space.

1495
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,159
But these people

1496
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,159
didn't have a place

1497
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:50,159
to start.

1498
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:52,159
Then they went there

1499
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,159
and nothing happened.

1500
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:56,159
The infrastructure

1501
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,239
was too small

1502
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:00,239
and people thought

1503
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:02,239
that's it.

1504
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:04,239
If there is

1505
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:06,239
motivation in people

1506
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:08,239
or passion that these people

1507
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,239
will find,

1508
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,239
they will do what they need.

1509
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:14,239
People said

1510
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,239
that they wanted space

1511
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:18,239
and then nothing happened.

1512
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,239
It means

1513
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:22,239
that space is not what you want.

1514
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:24,239
It sounds like a cliché

1515
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,320
but everything is important

1516
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,320
for the team.

1517
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,320
When you organize

1518
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,320
events,

1519
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
do you really need 350 people?

1520
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,320
Is it enough

1521
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,320
to have one, two, three?

1522
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
For example

1523
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,320
Ruby Meetup

1524
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,320
has seven people

1525
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
sometimes five.

1526
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
Now there are more,

1527
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
but these are people

1528
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
who have been doing Ruby for 15 years

1529
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,400
and they all know each other.

1530
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,400
People organize events

1531
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,400
for people,

1532
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
don't forget that.

1533
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
Now,

1534
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
if CyberPipa is mentioned again...

1535
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
CyberPipa is great.

1536
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
CyberPipa is important

1537
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
historically.

1538
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,400
You know what's fascinating?

1539
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,400
I will mention it again.

1540
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:22,479
When people come

1541
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:24,479
and say

1542
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:26,479
that it was great

1543
01:01:26,479 --> 01:01:28,479
but I have never been there

1544
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:30,479
because I was so confused.

1545
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:32,479
Everyone told me

1546
01:01:32,479 --> 01:01:34,479
that something really started there.

1547
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:38,479
It definitely made an impact.

1548
01:01:38,479 --> 01:01:40,479
Definitely.

1549
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,479
There are a lot of such things.

1550
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,479
People always talk about

1551
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:46,479
how it was in the past.

1552
01:01:46,479 --> 01:01:48,479
Now we are working

1553
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,559
and we don't know how long it will be.

1554
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,559
Let's make this episode

1555
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,559
in order.

1556
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,559
Let's make this episode

1557
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,559
now.

1558
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,559
Maybe we can discuss

1559
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,559
CyberPipa with Šanko.

1560
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,559
Are you afraid that it will be the last one?

1561
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,559
My attitude is always like that.

1562
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,559
When I look at it,

1563
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,559
it doesn't matter.

1564
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,559
Now we have to do it.

1565
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,559
Everything has to be done well.

1566
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,640
You always worry that it won't be.

1567
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,640
I always think about it.

1568
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,640
But now you talk

1569
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,640
as if it's a dream.

1570
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,640
Yes, it's a dream.

1571
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,640
We are here, in space, in time.

1572
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,640
I don't own the field.

1573
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,640
No.

1574
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,640
Let's talk about it.

1575
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,640
We have

1576
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,640
a strategy.

1577
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,640
It's a document.

1578
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,640
If you go to ogrodi.si

1579
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,640
you will get a new design.

1580
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,719
There is a tab called strategy.

1581
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:48,719
It's written there.

1582
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:50,719
We have one document.

1583
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,719
You can see it by the links in ogrodi.si.

1584
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:54,719
Yes, everything is in ogrodi.si.

1585
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,719
I don't know if people have changed it.

1586
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:58,719
It's the only document

1587
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:00,719
that exists in Grodno.

1588
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:02,719
We have written it.

1589
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,719
It's a manifesto.

1590
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:06,719
We are keeping it.

1591
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:08,719
We have updated it.

1592
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,719
But

1593
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:12,719
it's very important.

1594
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,799
Because

1595
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,799
it's a contract

1596
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,799
between us.

1597
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,799
Why do we do it?

1598
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,799
What are the values?

1599
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,799
Where are we together?

1600
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,799
For whom

1601
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,799
will we do it?

1602
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,799
Where does it go?

1603
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,799
Now we have to update it

1604
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,799
because the vest is getting older.

1605
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,799
But

1606
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,799
it's changing.

1607
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,799
It's growing.

1608
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,880
If you can say

1609
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
what you are proposing

1610
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
it's not related to

1611
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,880
values or strategies

1612
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
that we have established.

1613
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,880
Now we will evolve

1614
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
against those values

1615
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,880
or we will go somewhere else.

1616
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,880
Or we will change the strategy.

1617
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,880
But it's good

1618
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
that you have the same people.

1619
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
After this episode

1620
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
we will record something a bit different.

1621
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,880
A bit different?

1622
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,960
It's easy

1623
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,960
to do it.

1624
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,960
It looks like

1625
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,960
you are a Zen monster.

1626
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,960
But

1627
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,960
this is

1628
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
a strategy.

1629
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,960
This is a reward for doing a reward.

1630
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,960
So this is

1631
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,960
a Zen monster.

1632
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,960
Next question.

1633
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,960
Jan told me

1634
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,960
how much time we have left.

1635
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,960
Do we have SD cards again?

1636
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,039
I don't know.

1637
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,039
We have people locked in a cage.

1638
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,039
They can order

1639
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,039
or get married.

1640
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,039
Ok.

1641
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,039
Ok.

1642
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,039
This question is still in the chat

1643
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,039
and it says

1644
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,039
Do you think that

1645
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,039
a community funded way of support

1646
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,039
is possible in Slovenia?

1647
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,039
Yes.

1648
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,039
Are you a community funded?

1649
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,039
Are you?

1650
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,119
No.

1651
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,119
We are not a community funded.

1652
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,119
Did you think about it?

1653
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,119
We are.

1654
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,119
More than once.

1655
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,119
More than once

1656
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,119
we were locked in a cage.

1657
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,119
Maybe more time for pressure

1658
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,119
or that so many things happened in our lives

1659
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,119
that we didn't take a step forward

1660
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,119
and formalize it.

1661
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,119
You have Patreon.

1662
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,119
Community funded.

1663
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,119
We needed a lot of time

1664
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
for that.

1665
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,200
We had to talk about it.

1666
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,200
For a long time.

1667
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
Struggles.

1668
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,200
But if you are a community funded

1669
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,200
then you can be a community funded.

1670
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Exactly.

1671
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
It sounds trivial

1672
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,200
but

1673
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
then it means

1674
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
that from someone

1675
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
for the story you produce

1676
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
you get something.

1677
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,200
And before that

1678
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,280
it is

1679
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,280
very important

1680
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,280
because it validates

1681
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,280
that what we do today

1682
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,280
brings so much value

1683
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,280
that people are ready to pay for it.

1684
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
From a product perspective.

1685
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,280
You can see

1686
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,280
that it is not so much value

1687
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,280
but just for you to start

1688
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,280
people are ready to support you.

1689
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,280
Yes.

1690
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,280
I can imagine

1691
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,280
when people say

1692
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,359
that they are just starting

1693
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,359
but I will give them more.

1694
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,359
And they are not so unprepared

1695
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,359
but they do what they do

1696
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,359
and I think it is a good thing.

1697
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,359
That it brings so much value.

1698
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,359
You have a lot of disposable income

1699
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,359
so why not give it to them

1700
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,359
and ask for it.

1701
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,359
I always think

1702
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,359
that just before I publish an episode

1703
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,359
and before I press send, upload, publish

1704
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,359
it would be great

1705
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,359
if someone else did it

1706
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,440
just for 5 euros.

1707
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,440
If I was just

1708
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,440
a subscriber,

1709
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,439
someone else would do it

1710
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,439
and I would just subscribe.

1711
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:09,439
Then it would be great.

1712
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,439
Who wouldn't?

1713
01:07:11,439 --> 01:07:13,439
But

1714
01:07:15,439 --> 01:07:17,439
I think

1715
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:19,439
there are

1716
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:21,439
5 of us

1717
01:07:21,439 --> 01:07:23,439
in this story

1718
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,439
and if in the beginning we were minus

1719
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,520
we were working

1720
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,520
in our own way

1721
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,520
and then we came a bit closer

1722
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,520
to nothing

1723
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,520
we are not over nothing yet.

1724
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,520
A lot of the equipment

1725
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,520
is disposable

1726
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,520
we drive on our own gas

1727
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,520
we have our own electricity

1728
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,520
a lot of that.

1729
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,520
So

1730
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,520
if you want to have

1731
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,520
equipment production

1732
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,520
you will pay a lot

1733
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,599
so

1734
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,599
this production costs

1735
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,599
we don't work for free

1736
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,599
we don't pay for anything

1737
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,599
even if it looks like a top sheet

1738
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,599
that part is very expensive

1739
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,599
especially if you don't

1740
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,599
count the time we put in

1741
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,599
and the energy

1742
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,599
and the waste.

1743
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,599
That's an interesting factor

1744
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:19,599
because we know how to calculate

1745
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:21,599
the time and we didn't count our own

1746
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,680
because that's a lot of money.

1747
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,680
The streets

1748
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,680
work according to the same principle

1749
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,680
we have been volunteering for 14 years

1750
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,680
so

1751
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,680
once a street vendor

1752
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,680
didn't get a salary

1753
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,680
once one of us didn't pay the salary

1754
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,680
those burgers that you all eat at the end of the season

1755
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,680
we cover

1756
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,680
our own pockets

1757
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,680
we paid a lot

1758
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,680
for a few things

1759
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,680
we have very nice supporters

1760
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,760
friends

1761
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,760
that help us

1762
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,760
pay for the space

1763
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,760
we have our own equipment

1764
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,760
time and energy

1765
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,760
are the things that

1766
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,760
drive the initiative forward

1767
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,760
yes,

1768
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,760
there could be community funded

1769
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
options

1770
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,760
but it requires a lot

1771
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,760
of administrative and bureaucratic work

1772
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,760
especially

1773
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,760
the mental pressure

1774
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,839
the pressure to deliver

1775
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,839
I know

1776
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,839
you probably go back to

1777
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,839
the commitment

1778
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,839
if you eat yourself

1779
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,839
DIY

1780
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,839
concept

1781
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,839
help us

1782
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,839
what will you deliver

1783
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,839
we will try our best

1784
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,839
it can be a war

1785
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,839
and if that's the expectation

1786
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,839
that can happen

1787
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,839
you probably don't give a fuck

1788
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,839
we will constantly

1789
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,839
work on that level

1790
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,839
and if you realize

1791
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,839
that it's the bare minimum

1792
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,839
and you expect

1793
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,839
that it will be constant

1794
01:09:57,839 --> 01:09:59,839
then it's not a problem

1795
01:09:59,839 --> 01:10:01,839
we already had those difficulties

1796
01:10:01,839 --> 01:10:03,839
when we were filming

1797
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:05,839
during the pandemic

1798
01:10:05,839 --> 01:10:07,839
when we had Zoom calls

1799
01:10:07,839 --> 01:10:09,839
and then everyone

1800
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,839
was watching

1801
01:10:11,839 --> 01:10:13,839
a little before the pandemic

1802
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,839
if you remember

1803
01:10:15,839 --> 01:10:17,839
correct me if I'm wrong

1804
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,839
a couple of months

1805
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:21,839
5-6 months before the pandemic

1806
01:10:21,839 --> 01:10:23,839
we started with some

1807
01:10:23,839 --> 01:10:25,839
streams

1808
01:10:25,839 --> 01:10:27,839
and some

1809
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,839
uploads

1810
01:10:29,839 --> 01:10:31,839
but it was very simple

1811
01:10:31,839 --> 01:10:33,839
we had one old phone

1812
01:10:33,839 --> 01:10:35,839
that no one used

1813
01:10:35,839 --> 01:10:37,839
one cheap tripod

1814
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:39,839
we put it in the toilet

1815
01:10:39,839 --> 01:10:41,839
the toilet had

1816
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:43,839
no sound

1817
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,839
so we just

1818
01:10:45,839 --> 01:10:47,839
put a cable in the phone

1819
01:10:47,839 --> 01:10:49,839
and it was editing

1820
01:10:49,839 --> 01:10:51,839
and uploading

1821
01:10:51,839 --> 01:10:53,839
and then everyone

1822
01:10:53,839 --> 01:10:55,839
wanted to have

1823
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:57,839
a production

1824
01:10:57,839 --> 01:10:59,839
and we were thinking

1825
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,839
what if we make a company

1826
01:11:01,839 --> 01:11:03,839
and get some money

1827
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:05,839
then we can get a better phone

1828
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:07,839
or a camera

1829
01:11:07,839 --> 01:11:09,839
microphones

1830
01:11:09,839 --> 01:11:11,839
a mini setup

1831
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:13,839
so we can film

1832
01:11:13,839 --> 01:11:15,839
it's not because

1833
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,839
we are serving

1834
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:19,839
because we haven't been serving

1835
01:11:19,839 --> 01:11:21,839
for 13 years

1836
01:11:21,839 --> 01:11:23,839
it's because we want

1837
01:11:23,839 --> 01:11:25,839
people who come

1838
01:11:25,839 --> 01:11:27,839
and take time

1839
01:11:27,839 --> 01:11:29,839
we want to give them

1840
01:11:29,839 --> 01:11:31,839
something good

1841
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,839
a good product

1842
01:11:33,839 --> 01:11:35,839
to have some value

1843
01:11:35,839 --> 01:11:37,839
I think

1844
01:11:37,839 --> 01:11:39,839
it's very important

1845
01:11:39,839 --> 01:11:41,839
if one of those

1846
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,839
people

1847
01:11:43,839 --> 01:11:45,839
if it's a passion

1848
01:11:45,839 --> 01:11:47,839
that interests them

1849
01:11:47,839 --> 01:11:49,839
to stream

1850
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:51,839
for you it's 8k

1851
01:11:51,839 --> 01:11:53,839
if it's for you

1852
01:11:53,839 --> 01:11:55,839
then yes

1853
01:11:55,839 --> 01:11:57,839
it's not like

1854
01:11:57,839 --> 01:11:59,839
we'll do it

1855
01:11:59,839 --> 01:12:01,839
because the audience expects it

1856
01:12:01,839 --> 01:12:03,839
it kills

1857
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,839
the part

1858
01:12:05,839 --> 01:12:07,839
that you are working on

1859
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:09,839
if it's for you

1860
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:11,839
it's probably for you

1861
01:12:11,839 --> 01:12:13,839
because you saw the shape

1862
01:12:13,839 --> 01:12:15,839
of the people

1863
01:12:15,839 --> 01:12:17,839
to continue the story

1864
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,839
to be happy

1865
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:21,839
to get some topics

1866
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:23,839
and that's it

1867
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,839
if it's for you

1868
01:12:25,839 --> 01:12:27,839
to have a 8k live stream

1869
01:12:27,839 --> 01:12:29,839
then it would be

1870
01:12:29,839 --> 01:12:31,839
it would be our duty

1871
01:12:31,839 --> 01:12:33,839
to have a live stream

1872
01:12:33,839 --> 01:12:35,839
I can now

1873
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,839
for the last few questions

1874
01:12:37,839 --> 01:12:39,839
because we'll finish in a while

1875
01:12:39,839 --> 01:12:41,839
is it cool for you?

1876
01:12:41,839 --> 01:12:43,839
easy

1877
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:47,839
sometimes I have wet wishes

1878
01:12:47,839 --> 01:12:49,839
and sometimes wet dreams

1879
01:12:49,839 --> 01:12:51,839
wet dreams and questions

1880
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,839
for both

1881
01:12:53,839 --> 01:12:55,839
this question is for you

1882
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:57,839
no, I'll serve it to you

1883
01:12:57,839 --> 01:12:59,839
warm

1884
01:12:59,839 --> 01:13:01,839
wet dreams and questions for you

1885
01:13:01,839 --> 01:13:03,839
what would you like to see in Grodje in a few years?

1886
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,839
I don't know if it's written like that

1887
01:13:09,839 --> 01:13:11,839
wet dreams

1888
01:13:13,839 --> 01:13:15,839
here it's so clear

1889
01:13:15,839 --> 01:13:17,839
maybe more from myself

1890
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:19,839
not from the whole team

1891
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:21,839
in Grodje

1892
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:23,839
but I especially see

1893
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:25,839
from that

1894
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:27,839
manifest

1895
01:13:27,839 --> 01:13:29,839
that

1896
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:31,839
it's

1897
01:13:31,839 --> 01:13:33,839
a connection

1898
01:13:33,839 --> 01:13:35,839
that helps

1899
01:13:35,839 --> 01:13:37,839
the individuals

1900
01:13:37,839 --> 01:13:39,839
in Slovenia

1901
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,839
to do something good

1902
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,839
and write those stories

1903
01:13:43,839 --> 01:13:45,839
that

1904
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:47,839
we can be something else

1905
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:49,839
in some other year

1906
01:13:49,839 --> 01:13:51,839
or that year

1907
01:13:51,839 --> 01:13:53,839
or in some other beer

1908
01:13:53,839 --> 01:13:55,839
and say

1909
01:13:55,839 --> 01:13:57,839
10-15 years ago

1910
01:13:57,839 --> 01:13:59,839
it was good

1911
01:13:59,839 --> 01:14:01,839
I think that

1912
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:03,839
it's

1913
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,839
I never

1914
01:14:05,839 --> 01:14:07,839
never

1915
01:14:07,839 --> 01:14:09,839
in meetups and events

1916
01:14:09,839 --> 01:14:11,839
that I do now

1917
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,839
I value more

1918
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:15,839
quality of content

1919
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:17,839
than quantity

1920
01:14:17,839 --> 01:14:19,839
how many people watched

1921
01:14:19,839 --> 01:14:21,839
how many people came to watch

1922
01:14:21,839 --> 01:14:23,839
it doesn't matter to me

1923
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,839
and I think that

1924
01:14:25,839 --> 01:14:27,839
if it will

1925
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:29,839
leave a mark

1926
01:14:29,839 --> 01:14:31,839
that it was

1927
01:14:31,839 --> 01:14:33,839
a good event

1928
01:14:33,839 --> 01:14:35,839
we connected

1929
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:37,839
I don't know

1930
01:14:37,839 --> 01:14:39,839
if we connected

1931
01:14:39,839 --> 01:14:41,839
two people at the other end

1932
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:43,839
of Slovenia

1933
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,839
two different communities

1934
01:14:45,839 --> 01:14:47,839
to find

1935
01:14:47,839 --> 01:14:49,839
a new startup

1936
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:51,839
a new company

1937
01:14:51,839 --> 01:14:53,839
or a new community

1938
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:55,839
Thank you very much, Ilona

1939
01:14:57,839 --> 01:14:59,839
Yes

1940
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Same question for you, for Spletna Urica.

1941
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I thought you were going to say it for Grodje.

1942
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
No, for Grodje.

1943
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Let's try it one at a time.

1944
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,000
When I see Spletna Urica in a couple of years, 5, 10, 15, how old are we?

1945
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It says wet dreams.

1946
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Wet dreams.

1947
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
It's easy even today.

1948
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I see Spletna Urica not as a physical space, but a space that gives young people opportunities.

1949
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I always ask myself, if there was no Urica and no space for a young, ambitious,

1950
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:00,000
with a head full of hair, Blinder, I wouldn't have a career in IT, I wouldn't have met these people.

1951
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
A lot of stories have been born before and after Shank.

1952
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:16,000
To have a space, an independent space, where anyone interested in technology,

1953
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,000
and in the world of technology, can satisfy their curiosity.

1954
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That's what I see.

1955
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
In what form?

1956
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
We'll see.

1957
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It's a living organism, it's constantly changing.

1958
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So, that's it.

1959
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Great.

1960
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I hope...

1961
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Do you have a tip for wet dreams?

1962
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I told you, choose a strategy from what you wrote.

1963
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Ah, that's it.

1964
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Strategies for wet dreams.

1965
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Strategies for wet dreams.

1966
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
That's it.

1967
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Be this layer, this framework, so we can sustainably build these stories,

1968
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
so we can pass them on,

1969
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:14,000
so we can build a strong community of people with similar ambitions,

1970
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
who work in this space,

1971
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
and who can tell their stories,

1972
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
and who can tell their stories,

1973
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
so that someone from across the world,

1974
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
from some village,

1975
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
can come and work in Google,

1976
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
and in your phone,

1977
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
and in the whole world,

1978
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
so that we have good engineering in Slovenia,

1979
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
so that we know how to build products in Slovenia,

1980
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
so that we are as good as anywhere else,

1981
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
so that we can do this in any form,

1982
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
where media is not important,

1983
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
so that we can do this,

1984
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
because it will be fun,

1985
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
because we will be happy,

1986
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
because we will have some satisfaction from this,

1987
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
so that it will be good for us,

1988
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
and if it doesn't,

1989
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
then we will be OK.

1990
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
But, yeah...

1991
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I don't know why we do this,

1992
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
and why we choose ourselves,

1993
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
but I always have this in my head,

1994
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I don't know,

1995
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
you go to events,

1996
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and then a shy first-year student comes up to you,

1997
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
and says, hey, I listened to all your episodes,

1998
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
it's great, I didn't know it was growing,

1999
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and then you see,

2000
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
you show them,

2001
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
hey, we are the same people,

2002
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and then you see,

2003
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
it's a very reliable thing,

2004
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I hope we can do it,

2005
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
something like that.

2006
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I know, it's a lot of fun.

2007
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Will you have any last questions?

2008
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I don't know,

2009
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
what is the last question?

2010
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Pepperoni or chili?

2011
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
That came up right away.

2012
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And then there's the,

2013
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
let's stay away from the wet ones.

2014
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So,

2015
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
content creation

2016
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
was probably

2017
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
a little bit more for us,

2018
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
but it's all connected.

2019
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
How important is the creation

2020
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
of a person, blog, video,

2021
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
for an individual programmer,

2022
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
or for his career?

2023
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And then we can connect it somehow.

2024
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
How important is

2025
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
the creation of a person today?

2026
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And content, and video,

2027
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and tutorials, and everything.

2028
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I think that

2029
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
everything that

2030
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
relates to content,

2031
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
if you want to prosper

2032
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
somewhere,

2033
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
at the beginning of your career,

2034
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
you already gained some knowledge,

2035
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
probably because

2036
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
people call you,

2037
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
so you can sell yourself.

2038
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Try to sell as much as possible at conferences,

2039
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
show up as much as possible,

2040
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
try to transfer

2041
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
that knowledge forward,

2042
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
because in this way

2043
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
you increase your credibility,

2044
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
you learn more,

2045
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
even if they tell you

2046
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
that you're not good enough.

2047
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It's also a kind of learning.

2048
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Definitely,

2049
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
to participate in the teaching.

2050
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And if you're so good

2051
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
that you know what to write,

2052
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
and have your own personal blog,

2053
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
that's great.

2054
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But if you're an influencer,

2055
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and you need YouTube,

2056
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I'm afraid that young people

2057
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
are lying to me,

2058
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that they are used to

2059
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
being in front of the camera,

2060
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and talking to themselves.

2061
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I don't know.

2062
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Can I have a hot take on this topic?

2063
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Yes, go ahead.

2064
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I don't know,

2065
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
sometimes I say something

2066
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
and people look at me strangely.

2067
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I think that we collectively

2068
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
brainwashed people

2069
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
with the idea

2070
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
that everything has to become

2071
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
a content production machine.

2072
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Anyway,

2073
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
as anyone who works in IT,

2074
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
not just a developer,

2075
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
you spend a lot of time

2076
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and brain energy

2077
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
to break down complex problems

2078
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
into smaller ones,

2079
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
and then put them

2080
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
together in a mosaic.

2081
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And now,

2082
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I think it's not fair

2083
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
to expect that

2084
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
you'll have your own blog

2085
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and produce a certain amount of content.

2086
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Let's collectively

2087
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
not put

2088
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
any pressure

2089
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
on young people

2090
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
who are starting on this path.

2091
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Self-pace.

2092
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Do a good project,

2093
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
document it well,

2094
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and post it

2095
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
so that it becomes

2096
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
a constant

2097
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
production for the content.

2098
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You probably have to ask yourself

2099
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
what the endgame is.

2100
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
What would you achieve?

2101
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Or would you just

2102
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
restrain yourself?

2103
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I have the feeling

2104
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
that a lot happens

2105
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
when you look at bloggers,

2106
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
who are huge bloggers,

2107
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
until they reached

2108
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
the next level.

2109
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Was it because they got a job?

2110
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I remember

2111
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
a blogger

2112
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
who was very popular

2113
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
in Second Life.

2114
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
He got a shift

2115
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in Second Life

2116
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
because he wrote

2117
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
the experience of Second Life,

2118
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
his blog, and so on.

2119
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
At the moment,

2120
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
there was not much

2121
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
in that blog.

2122
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
His endgame was

2123
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
how to get there.

2124
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
If someone

2125
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
was a super engineer

2126
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and wanted to

2127
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
get to Google,

2128
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
maybe he would write

2129
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
a blog in algorithms

2130
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and try to build

2131
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
his credibility

2132
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
so that he could

2133
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
talk to Google for a job.

2134
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I don't know.

2135
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Even if you are

2136
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
a good,

2137
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
top-notch programmer,

2138
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
you don't need to know how to write articles.

2139
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Exactly! That's what I said earlier.

2140
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
You don't need to.

2141
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Maybe

2142
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
step one is to document

2143
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
all your side projects.

2144
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Document

2145
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
in the style

2146
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
of whatever I do

2147
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
on GitHub.

2148
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
You work as a repository

2149
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
of your projects.

2150
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That's a minimal step.

2151
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Whatever I play, whatever I experiment,

2152
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
just snippet codes,

2153
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
just a toy project,

2154
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
just to get used

2155
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
to the routine of publishing

2156
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and publishing.

2157
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Also,

2158
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
if you see that someone

2159
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
made a book,

2160
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
if you see that

2161
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you used someone's book

2162
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
and you found a bug,

2163
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
just tell them

2164
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that you found a bug,

2165
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
open it and report it.

2166
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That's also considered

2167
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
an active thing,

2168
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I'm interested in things,

2169
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'm ready to take the next step,

2170
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I know how to use these tools,

2171
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I'm aware of them,

2172
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
and you discover

2173
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
that there are other people

2174
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
on the other side

2175
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
of the online community.

2176
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Whatever you give,

2177
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
it's better than nothing.

2178
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Most people in this space

2179
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
consume,

2180
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
contribute,

2181
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
and if you write an article,

2182
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
if you write a blog post,

2183
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
if you come to a meeting,

2184
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
it's much more

2185
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
than anyone else did.

2186
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Then a few meetings,

2187
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
a few smaller meetups,

2188
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and then you have

2189
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
the experience

2190
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
of how to register

2191
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
for a conference,

2192
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
what are the other disadvantages.

2193
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
For example, people don't know

2194
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
that if you register

2195
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
for a bigger international conference,

2196
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
they usually have

2197
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
a speaker dinner,

2198
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and that means

2199
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
that you are at an international conference

2200
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
together with

2201
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
the biggest entrepreneurs

2202
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and you get

2203
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
access to a network

2204
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
of top people,

2205
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
and you can build

2206
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
your name

2207
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
over time.

2208
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
You start with smaller events

2209
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
to gain more experience.

2210
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
What you said is true,

2211
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
it can be overwhelming.

2212
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Let's start with Kodo,

2213
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
with a little correction.

2214
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
If I may,

2215
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Kodo is a platform

2216
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
where you can

2217
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
connect with people

2218
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and use it as an app.

2219
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Maribor is always open

2220
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
for new teachers,

2221
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
so if any of you

2222
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
want to come

2223
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
and say something,

2224
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
just call us.

2225
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
We are here.

2226
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Sometimes we are downstairs,

2227
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
sometimes we are on the floor.

2228
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Don't panic.

2229
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
We are big.

2230
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
But we already got people

2231
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
to come and say something.

2232
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Yes, yes.

2233
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Like, hey,

2234
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
from the marketing department,

2235
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
our boss came to say something.

2236
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's full.

2237
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I don't know

2238
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
if it will work.

2239
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I can explain why,

2240
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
because we are ready

2241
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
that it won't work.

2242
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It's better to have

2243
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
an engineer in their team

2244
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
to say something.

2245
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
We are more interested in that.

2246
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
But yes.

2247
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
What did you do?

2248
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I don't know.

2249
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I married,

2250
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
and we got closer.

2251
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Blender.

2252
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
That was it.

2253
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
You listened

2254
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and watched

2255
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Spletna Urica with Ogrodje

2256
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
live.

2257
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
3rd season,

2258
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
4th episode.

2259
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That's it.

2260
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Where can they find you?

2261
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
On all podcasting platforms.

2262
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And on YouTube.

2263
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
That's when they can say

2264
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
write it down

2265
