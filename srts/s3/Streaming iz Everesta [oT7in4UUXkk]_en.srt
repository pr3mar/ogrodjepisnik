1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Part 2

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Part 3

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Part 4

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Part 5

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Part 6

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Part 7

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And now we have the intro again.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, the beginning is cut.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I will edit it a bit,

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
maybe for this part

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
when I will edit the last part.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So that the light changes.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So that you are more enlightened

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in the dark phase

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then you can edit the intro.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In the last part I will just add

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
some background sounds of the Himalayas

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and the wind

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
blowing in the mountains

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so that people feel

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
like they are...

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
like they are falling down.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The Himalayas are not mountains,

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
they are mountains.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, Jan,

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in the meantime,

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
turn on the background noise.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I managed to change a bit today

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because we have a different atmosphere.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I managed to change it

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
into an intro passage.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It is from the book

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
by Reinhold Messner,

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
an uber-alpinist

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
world-famous

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
from his book called Death.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is a quote

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
at the beginning of the book

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
from a Swiss healer

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
who also dealt a lot with alpinism.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It is actually

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
a death pass. What is it?

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It goes like this.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A person can still acclimatize

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
at an altitude of 6,000 meters,

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but not more than 7,000 meters.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can get used to it

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in a short time.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why I am losing my eyes

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
can not be fully compensated

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
at the beginning.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Maybe the acclimatization limit

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
could be removed a few more,

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but we do not know.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
At an altitude of 7,000 meters

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
real damage occurs.

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The pain in the neck

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is converted from normal

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to chronic pain.

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Colds are dangerous

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
because the body

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
lacks oxygen.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The heart, which is difficult

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to adapt, expands,

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
so-called dilatation.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Insecurity is no longer

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
able to recover due to

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
lack of vital vitamins

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and to protect it

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from loss of flow.

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The body maintains

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
a superior physiological level.

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I wanted you to hear

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
what we are going to talk about

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
today,

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
what is the mission

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
of today's episode,

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
how we communicated

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
with the people

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
who went through

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
all those levels,

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
who went through those levels

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
where people do not exist,

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
where the environment

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is very hostile,

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
because

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the achievements

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
we talked about

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
should also be looked at

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
through this prism.

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The achievements in alpinism

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and in the technical sense

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
of what was needed

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to make this story work.

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I hope that

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
this definition of the problem

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
puts it in context.

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But now,

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
let's get back

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
to Grodno.

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We are in the heart

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
of the Computer Museum.

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
With us is

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jan Žorš,

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the second in this season.

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why did we meet

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
today among others?

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When we had that conversation,

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we got a hint

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
of a topic we would talk about,

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but it did not really

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
get to the point.

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But when we thought about it,

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
when we talked about it,

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we realized

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that it is a big topic.

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We are not only

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
passionate

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and successful alpinists

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in Slovenia.

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We also described ourselves

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
as the first streamers

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
on the Internet

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
from the Himalayas.

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Jan,

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you are part of this story,

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
two of these stories,

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and the fourth guest

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
on the show,

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
who

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
covered

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the technical part.

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, we will talk

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
about the two

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
trips you participated

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in.

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How did this

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
happen?

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We talked about

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
whether

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
it is something

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that is nice to have,

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that we now have

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
this stream there,

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
or is it something we can

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
survive,

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
we can forget about it,

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and move on.

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How did you

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
start with this?

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Did you find in this story,

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
which we will talk about later,

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
in Slovenian media,

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
that it was also

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
a victory

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
for Dusežek?

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So, Jan,

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
how?

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you very much

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
for the invitation,

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
both of you,

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and the whole team.

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was 25 years ago.

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We have already

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
made a few other things

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
at MES,

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
but yes,

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
as we were talking,

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I remembered that I still have

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
this laptop at home.

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, I pulled it out

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
of the closet

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and brought it with me.

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How did this story

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
start?

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It started

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
about a year ago,

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
when

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
this

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Andrej Kmet

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
came to me and said,

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Jan, Tomáš Humar

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is going to dance

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in America,

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
El Capitan,

186
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and it would be nice

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
if we make

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
a cover

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
of his dance,

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
El Capitan solo.

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think

192
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
he was the first to do it,

193
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
practically

194
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and so on.

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But at that time,

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
we did not succeed,

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
because we were

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
so amateurish,

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
as you will see later,

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
as a PGC society.

201
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Tomáš, Andrej and I,

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
when we tried to

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
put together some equipment,

204
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Xenia helped us

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
with various satellite phones,

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and so on.

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
For El Capitan,

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
we did not succeed,

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
because we did not have enough time.

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Later, Tomáš

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
heard

212
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the call from above,

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
when he called him in the camp.

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
At that time,

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Andrej and I were flying

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
for nine people.

217
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This IBM was

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
my office laptop.

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
At that time,

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was at CIOLO,

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
one of the pioneers of CIOLO.

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It was my office laptop.

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We said, let's see

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
what we can do with it.

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I was not yet in the Himalayas,

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was always on the other side.

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Andrej is a climber,

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and a computer scientist.

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We put together

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the most experienced

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
people from each area,

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and we created a system

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that would survive

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
in the Himalayas.

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The equipment was

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
in the base camp,

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
which is 5-6 thousand meters high.

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Up there,

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it is from very warm

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
to minus, I do not know how much.

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The equipment had to withstand it.

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We were preparing

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
if we could

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
make a stream

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
through a satellite.

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
At that time,

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
a company called

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Real Audio

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
made a server

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
called Real Audio.

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I do not know if it was already

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
visible at that time,

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but it was there.

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Actually,

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we brought it

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
together with Andrej.

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Xenia gave us

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
a satellite phone,

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
for which we

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
signed a contract.

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think it could

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
be connected to 9600.

263
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Serial communication.

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We said,

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
aha, we have it.

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We thought

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
what would be

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the most effective way

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
for two-way

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
communication.

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then we did it

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
so that there were

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Windows, I do not know,

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
XP, 590, I do not know what it was.

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You probably have

276
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
an adapter here.

277
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If they have it,

278
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
put it in the computer.

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We'll see if it still works.

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
About a year ago,

281
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I put it back together

282
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and turned it off.

283
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It is just

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a historical example.

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We somehow

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
connected it together.

287
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The satellite phone

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
went to the laptop's com port.

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then I thought

290
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
how can I get

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
information from

292
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the laptop as easily as possible.

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What did I put?

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
BBS.

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I put BBS software

296
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
on the laptop,

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
which was

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
driven by Stipe Božić.

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He was making pictures

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
with the laptop.

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Tomaž was climbing up

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and the day before he was in a cold sweat.

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
All these pictures

304
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
were assigned to one director.

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then I

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
from the

307
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
SIOLA space

308
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
connected to the modem

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
via the satellite

310
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
on the laptop.

311
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It turned out to be Jan.

312
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He was waiting for me

313
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
in the director's office.

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was waiting for the pictures.

315
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll explain BBS for a moment.

316
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can imagine it as

317
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
an FTP predecessor.

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, it's more of an Internet predecessor.

319
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Give us a crash course

320
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
on what BBS is.

321
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Give me a seat.

322
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
These

323
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
notes

324
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
were

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
about the Internet

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
that connects to each other.

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
BBS was

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
a bulletin board system

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
where you had a monitor

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
with two lines

331
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
to which people were called.

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You didn't call your provider

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and then connect to the Internet,

334
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but you called the BBS server

335
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
with a call dial-up access.

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Usually,

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you had to wait

338
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
in a very textual way.

339
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You had to wait

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
until the next day.

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You had to wait

342
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
until the next day.

343
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Maybe

344
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
we should

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
step back

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
so that people

347
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
have an idea

348
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
of what the Internet is.

349
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It started in 1999.

350
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Maybe we should step back

351
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
so that people

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
have an idea

353
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
of what the Internet is.

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There were call-ups.

355
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
ASDN was already present.

356
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
ASDN was already present.

357
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't remember.

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think it was 2001

359
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
when XDSL was first

360
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
brought to us.

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It was the turn of the millennium

362
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
when there was

363
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Y2K

364
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and Scare.

365
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
People were afraid

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that old Russian launchers

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
would drop rockets

368
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and systems would crash.

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There was no awareness

370
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
about technology yet.

371
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It was a completely different time.

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was a completely different time.

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Did people at home

374
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
already have a dial-up?

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Did people at home already have a dial-up?

376
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes.

377
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It was like

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
a two-channel

379
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I7N

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
with 128 megabits.

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It was like a two-channel I7N

382
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
with 128 megabits.

383
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It was like a two-channel I7N

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
with 128 megabits.

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We were talking

386
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
about this

387
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
earlier.

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We were talking about this

389
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
earlier.

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The problem today

391
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
is that you already

392
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
have a signal at the back

393
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and a trigger.

394
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not a challenge anymore.

395
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's not a challenge anymore.

396
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
At that time,

397
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
not only

398
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
in terms of technology,

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
but also in terms of good software

400
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that would support

401
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
this technology.

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can bring you back

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to the base camp in the Himalayas.

404
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,000

405
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I can bring you back to the base camp in the Himalayas.

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This means that this laptop

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is not fully charged.

408
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No, no, no.

409
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The problem is the battery.

410
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The problem is the battery.

411
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You don't have an electric

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
power source

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to charge it.

414
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We had solar panels

415
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and batteries that were charged

416
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
during the day.

417
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
In the Himalayas,

418
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
sometimes there is sun, sometimes there is not.

419
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Power management was very important.

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Power management was very important.

421
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Did you foresee

422
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the use of

423
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
cables?

424
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Did you foresee the use of cables?

425
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Everything.

426
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
All cables were

427
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
reserved.

428
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If a climber comes down

429
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
from a tree and steps on a cable,

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you have 10 days to get

431
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
to the first station.

432
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You don't have a complete system

433
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
of cables.

434
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Everything was double.

435
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There was only one laptop.

436
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I didn't have any service.

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We did it like this.

438
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
A group of citizens.

439
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You were in Ljubljana.

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was in Ljubljana.

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You were in Ljubljana, in Siolo.

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
On the other side.

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It was like this.

444
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We had some problems

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
with access to the base camp.

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We could not fly with a helicopter.

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Tomas said

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that it was a group of

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
private citizens.

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The mobile phone supported

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
us in the beginning.

452
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
They went down

453
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
for their day.

454
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Everything was

455
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
very limited.

456
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think that Andrej

457
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
couldn't get to the base camp.

458
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Stipe Božič was there.

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He was a photographer.

460
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He filmed everything.

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Andrej went

462
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to the base camp the day before.

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In a few days he taught him

464
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
how to do it.

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
From power management

466
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to how to install a laptop,

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
how to connect a satellite phone

468
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and so on.

469
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It was interesting.

470
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Then I realized

471
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
that when they were going

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and we were doing tests,

473
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I realized that

474
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
calling a satellite phone

475
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
was very expensive.

476
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Then I went

477
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
to Siolo in Pisarno.

478
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Rudi Skobe was there.

479
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He was the marketing director.

480
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We were doing a project.

481
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We were trying

482
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
to cover Tomas Humer.

483
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I would like Siolo

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
to support us.

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
He asked me what I needed.

486
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I told him that I needed

487
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
a phone in Pisarno

488
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
so that I could call

489
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and download

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the files.

491
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He said that he didn't have

492
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
any problem.

493
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's how Siolo

494
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
became one of the sponsors

495
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and supporters of the project.

496
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
By the way,

497
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
when I was passing by

498
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
his office.

499
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Was the stream

500
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
recorded and

501
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
uploaded?

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No.

503
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's talk about the pictures.

504
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I was from Ljubljana.

505
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I connected with a modem

506
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to this laptop via satellite.

507
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It was sent from BBS.

508
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Then I learned a few things

509
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
because this line was very unremarkable.

510
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When it fell down,

511
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the zip file fell down

512
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and I used Xmodem

513
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
or Zmodem, one of the protocols

514
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that enables continuity.

515
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I learned this very quickly.

516
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I used this

517
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
for the transfer

518
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
because Stipe

519
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
connected all the pictures.

520
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
On the other hand,

521
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
there was

522
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
an inbox file,

523
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
where all the

524
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
emails from that day

525
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
to that moment

526
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
were sent to

527
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Tomasathumor.com.

528
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We learned this from Stipe

529
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
how he put the inbox file

530
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
in the client's email

531
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and

532
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
how he practically

533
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
when Tomas was

534
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
up in the wall

535
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
with the whole Calvary.

536
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When you are up there

537
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and you are alone

538
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and you are down there

539
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and your tooth hurts

540
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and you are sad.

541
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
When he was talking

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
with someone

543
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
he said

544
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
when he came back

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
how much it meant to him

546
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
that Stipe

547
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
every time he got

548
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
the same file from him

549
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
started to pick up

550
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
all the emails

551
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that people sent to Tomas

552
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
through radio stations

553
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
in the wall.

554
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He said it meant a lot to him.

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He said he also answered

556
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
a couple of emails

557
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
from the middle of the wall

558
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
through radio stations.

559
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Stipe wrote them back

560
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and then he packed

561
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the inbox file

562
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and then I pulled it all down

563
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and executed

564
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
what I sent from the email server.

565
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The pictures were sent

566
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and the third member

567
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
of the team

568
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
was Matej Ropred

569
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
who was in charge

570
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
of the web.

571
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He was in charge of

572
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the old Apache servers

573
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and so on.

574
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He designed

575
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
all the pictures

576
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that I got down there

577
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and looked at them

578
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and so on.

579
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
These pictures

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
were sent to the website

581
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and in fact

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
primarily

583
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
why we wanted to do this.

584
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Tomas wanted to

585
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
expose

586
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
what happened to another climber

587
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
that he came to the top

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and nobody believed him

589
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
because he didn't have pictures

590
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
from the top

591
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
or anyone else.

592
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
He had all the pictures

593
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
up to the top, but not from the top.

594
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He said let's do this

595
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
so it can be broadcast

596
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
on the internet

597
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
so people can see

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
day by day where I am.

599
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It was intended for the public.

600
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It was intended for climbers.

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Maybe I interrupt you.

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
For that time

603
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
when you forgot

604
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
how you had

605
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the pictures

606
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and when it was

607
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
ordered on the web servers

608
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
do you have any idea

609
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
how many people were there?

610
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Was it a peak?

611
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you remember anything?

612
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I think we had

613
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
1,700,000 climbers

614
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
over 1,000,000 a day.

615
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I could put

616
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
additional servers

617
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
especially after the media

618
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
stole it.

619
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I am interested in that.

620
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Do you know

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
what this means

622
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
for Siol?

623
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
At the same time

624
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Siol was taken from the internet.

625
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It was a boom.

626
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
1,000,000 hits per day.

627
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I had big dreams.

628
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It was like an egg

629
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It was crazy.

630
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Can I ask you

631
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
who came

632
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
let's put it this way

633
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
when climbers go to Everest

634
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
they have base camps.

635
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Base camps are at different heights.

636
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You go up the steps

637
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
to one base camp

638
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and back to another

639
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
to go up and down

640
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to acclimatize.

641
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
When that laptop

642
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
came to the Himalayas

643
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
it was probably

644
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
with some other equipment

645
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that prepared it.

646
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
When you opened that case

647
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
what else was there besides the laptop?

648
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You mentioned

649
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
cables.

650
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There were a lot of different

651
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
power supplies.

652
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Tell us what was in the box.

653
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Very important were

654
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
solar panels

655
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
batteries. They were heavy.

656
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You couldn't carry

657
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
heavy batteries in a base camp.

658
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Then there was

659
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
a satellite phone.

660
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Everything you needed

661
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
like here

662
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
for 9 people

663
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
most of the things were 2.

664
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Did you have a satellite phone

665
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
there or on the other side?

666
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
No.

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I had a normal phone line.

668
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Did you call an operator?

669
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No, just a phone number.

670
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
A satellite phone.

671
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Fortunately,

672
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
the satellite phone was also a modem.

673
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
How stable

674
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
was that line?

675
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Terrible.

676
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Was it on the clock?

677
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Was there a specific moment

678
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
when you could call?

679
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, it was like that.

680
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
There was a voicemail.

681
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I called Stipe.

682
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I said, long live Jan!

683
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Long live Jan!

684
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What do you have today?

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He told me what was going on.

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Then he said

687
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I will prepare

688
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
a computer for you.

689
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I put everything on top.

690
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
He put everything together

691
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
because

692
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
every atom of energy

693
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
is very important there.

694
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Then he put it together.

695
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Then I called the modem

696
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and the modem answered.

697
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then I called so many times

698
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and continued the download

699
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
that the whole file

700
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
fell down.

701
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Then we distributed it here.

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Then,

703
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I called back

704
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
by voice.

705
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The telephone

706
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
that I had on the table

707
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I converted it so

708
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
that I got the sound

709
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
from the telephone out

710
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and connected it to my dream.

711
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
There was a real audio encoder.

712
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
When I called her

713
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it was a specific moment.

714
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,440
A few hours ago we announced on the internet when there will be a live audio stream.

715
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:17,000
And then Stipe told me that he had a connection to the radio station from his satellite phone.

716
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I talked to Tomaž directly when he was in Hrib.

717
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
In short, this conversation was streamed live on the internet.

718
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So people could hear live what I was talking to Tomaž about,

719
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
what problems he had in Hrib, what was happening to him in real time.

720
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It was just wow, unprecedented.

721
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So you were talking about the radio station and then from the radio station through the setup.

722
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
In fact, it was done in such a way that the satellite was connected to the radio station with audio.

723
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And in fact, every time I asked something, Stipe pressed the transmit button.

724
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And then when he released it, I could hear Tomaž answering back,

725
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and it went through the satellite to me.

726
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So on that side, both me and Tomaž could hear what he was saying.

727
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And then I heard a terrible rumbling.

728
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So I asked Tomaž what was that, and he said that a hand had hit 2 cm away from me.

729
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And it flew down.

730
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But ok, I'm alive.

731
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You are working from above.

732
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
In that setup, what was going on?

733
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Where are all the scenarios, what did you solve?

734
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Most of the time, the problem was the humidity.

735
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Because if you don't know how to work with equipment at such heights and at such temperature changes,

736
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
the humidity condenses very quickly.

737
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Especially in the equipment.

738
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And then if you bring the laptop out of the warm tent to minus so and so,

739
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
or vice versa, things will start to condense.

740
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Because of that, they were very, very, very predictable.

741
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
As far as that is concerned, very, very predictable.

742
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Otherwise, there were no bad entanglements.

743
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Probably also because there were not many people in that base camp.

744
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Only a small part of the crew went to the base camp,

745
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and not many people were working with that equipment.

746
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because in the previous base camps, which were lower,

747
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
everyone wanted to switch to electricity,

748
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and to take their e-mails to the computer.

749
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Here, it was practically without that.

750
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It was also interesting how the media got that over time.

751
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
They found out, oh, look, look,

752
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
there on www.humar.com there are daily pictures of Tomas when he is dancing.

753
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It was one media base, and then everyone else.

754
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And they started to simply download pictures from the website,

755
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and then send them.

756
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Because there was a blog post every day,

757
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
saying what was happening there.

758
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Without them knowing the truth.

759
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And we said, wait a minute.

760
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This is not going to work.

761
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And we warned them a few times,

762
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and we said, children, please do not believe.

763
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And they did not believe.

764
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then we said, all right,

765
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
let's wait for the pictures until 6 o'clock in the afternoon,

766
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
when the editorial office concludes with the message,

767
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
or with whatever they had.

768
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And then they started calling us in a panic,

769
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
where are the pictures?

770
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That they need the pictures.

771
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And I said, yes, the pictures are not until you tell them the truth.

772
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And then the scout team fell in love with telling the truth.

773
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And then we gave them those pictures.

774
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And then they started to reveal the truth from below.

775
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That's when I could start installing new servers.

776
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
That's when everything started to work out.

777
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
How long did you have the dry training at home?

778
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
How did you test the setup at home?

779
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
How long did you prepare?

780
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
One week.

781
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
One week?

782
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes.

783
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Andrej and I were in a big team,

784
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and we simply made those things a bit different.

785
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We played a bit with the software.

786
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We did things together.

787
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
He was a computer scientist,

788
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so everything was clear to him.

789
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That's how you work with professionals.

790
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
How long did Andrej need for dry training?

791
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's a different question.

792
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't know.

793
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But here it was still,

794
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
on this side is your interaction,

795
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and on the other side is the interaction of people.

796
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It wasn't as sad as it is today,

797
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
when a person opens a YouTube channel

798
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and they simply split up.

799
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You have to take into account

800
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
that there was no other streaming software

801
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
than Real Audio.

802
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
If it wasn't for Real Audio Video,

803
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I think they released the first beta with video.

804
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There wasn't anything else.

805
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There was Quick Time,

806
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and other things came later.

807
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Real Audio was practically the main one.

808
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes, there was nothing else at that time.

809
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The idea of having video or audio on the Internet

810
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
was a revolution.

811
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Can you tell us more about the bandwidth,

812
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
the resolution of the images,

813
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
how did people feel about the content?

814
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Do you mean video or audio?

815
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Both, tell us.

816
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The images we talked about

817
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
probably weren't 5,000 pixels at a time.

818
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
No, no, no.

819
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
If they were 1,080 times,

820
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't know how good it would be.

821
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Or 1,200 times.

822
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I told Stipe to reduce it a bit.

823
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Because if he would upload pictures

824
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
from a camera,

825
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I would need more than one day.

826
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It was 9,600 communications per satellite

827
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
from another part of the Earth.

828
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We were able to optimize everything.

829
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The sound I streamed,

830
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
those conversations live,

831
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I think it was the default.

832
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I think you had a multi-rate.

833
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You had 32K, then 16K, then 9K.

834
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Depending on your connection speed,

835
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
you were able to change the client and server.

836
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It was a revolution.

837
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It was a whole thing.

838
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Then you had another release.

839
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Later, right?

840
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yes, yes.

841
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It was the revolution of video,

842
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
if I understood correctly.

843
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes, video came first.

844
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But that was a year later.

845
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No, that was...

846
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That was 2,000, right?

847
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes.

848
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That was a test.

849
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
2,000 was in Lodz.

850
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It was a release.

851
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Fans went to Lodz,

852
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and Andrej went with them.

853
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We set up a system.

854
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
We were testing there

855
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
live video streaming.

856
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
If I remember correctly,

857
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
the satellite phone was Nera.

858
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It had 64K connection.

859
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It was a huge upgrade.

860
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes, a huge upgrade.

861
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But that release was more sponsored.

862
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
We were able to hire Nera satellites.

863
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
We were testing there.

864
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
There was a Sony Vaio laptop.

865
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We set up a real audio video encoder on it.

866
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
At that time,

867
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
nothing was public.

868
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Andrej and I were testing

869
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
how things work.

870
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
What came to us later,

871
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
it was 1921 or 1922,

872
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I don't remember exactly,

873
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
when Davo Karničar

874
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
took over Hammond Everest.

875
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's when we used

876
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
this newly acquired knowledge.

877
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Of course, again,

878
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
a complete setup,

879
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
batteries,

880
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
solar panels,

881
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
the whole system.

882
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Did you upgrade it?

883
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yes, we upgraded it a bit.

884
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
We got a lighter battery,

885
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
so the gods of Sherpa

886
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
didn't open it up.

887
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That's when this happened.

888
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We had a small camera from Canon.

889
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I think Andrej put some duct tape

890
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
on the big lens.

891
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
This huge lens.

892
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Somehow we managed to get a picture.

893
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
On a webcam?

894
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
No, a handheld camera.

895
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
DV.

896
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Digital video.

897
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yes, digital video.

898
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It records analog,

899
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
but writes in digital.

900
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
From this camera,

901
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
the analog form of the cable

902
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
went to the card

903
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
that took the audio and video

904
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
from the laptop.

905
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
There was an audio-video encoder.

906
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We connected the laptop

907
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
through a neural satellite,

908
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
which was capable of

909
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
connecting 64 kilos of data.

910
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This was then streamed from there.

911
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Andrej went to Kalapatar,

912
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
which is 6,000 meters high.

913
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
On the opposite side,

914
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
we have Everest.

915
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
He waited there.

916
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
He had a stand with him

917
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and a base camp.

918
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I think all this was included

919
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
in the communication through the camera.

920
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
When he started to run,

921
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
unfortunately, the sun was shining

922
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
from the back.

923
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But this is not something

924
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
you can influence.

925
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
At that moment.

926
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
He set it all up

927
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
at 6,000 meters.

928
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
When he started to run,

929
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
here in Slovenia,

930
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
you could practically

931
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
sit down in an armchair,

932
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
turn on the computer,

933
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
connect to the Internet

934
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and watch the sunrise

935
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
from the top of Mount Everest

936
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
as if you were watching

937
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
a sunrise in the Kranj mountains.

938
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It was incomprehensible.

939
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The camera was on the other side

940
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and with the body lens

941
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
you could catch the sunrise.

942
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Then he took it to the top,

943
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
then down through Hilare,

944
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
then down to Pren.

945
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
On that side,

946
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I had...

947
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I think it was

948
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the Sun Ultra 250,

949
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
which was a real audio video server,

950
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
but it was only for split stream.

951
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Then I had a whole horde of Suns,

952
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
which I splitted into streams.

953
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
If I could watch a stream,

954
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I could switch to a split server,

955
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
so I could watch a stream.

956
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
All the others,

957
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
no matter how much we added them,

958
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
were full at the moment.

959
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It was full capacity at the moment.

960
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Because the media took it,

961
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
the thing got bigger.

962
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The thing got worse,

963
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
because DarwinAwards.com

964
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
put a link to the first thing.

965
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
They said, look at that Norwegian

966
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
who will be a live fan.

967
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
At that time,

968
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
you could bake eggs on those servers.

969
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I had a few colleagues from Siola.

970
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Let's leave that for later.

971
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Who paid for all those servers?

972
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Was it Siola?

973
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes, Siola.

974
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
But it was through Tomas Humer.com?

975
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
No, it was Davo Karnicar.

976
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm sorry, Davo Karnicar.

977
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Was the host on your site?

978
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
No, no.

979
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Siola was a technological partner.

980
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Simo had it,

981
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and one agency was running

982
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
the whole project,

983
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
from the beginning.

984
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We had full support.

985
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But all those servers,

986
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I practically pulled them out.

987
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
They were spare servers on Siola,

988
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
in case other servers crashed.

989
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I had a few colleagues from Siola

990
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
installing and configuring new servers.

991
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Just for that project?

992
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
No, it was live.

993
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
He was the one who crashed it.

994
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We were pulling the servers out,

995
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and I was configuring the split stream.

996
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Then they were added to the frontend

997
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
so that people could access the servers.

998
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
How many servers?

999
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
6-7 servers.

1000
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
All of them were full.

1001
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Until the end.

1002
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Did it affect the accuracy?

1003
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
No, you just didn't come to the right place.

1004
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The server was full, and that was it.

1005
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
If I had 10 more servers,

1006
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I would have added 10 more.

1007
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
At that time, it was D-technology

1008
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
that existed.

1009
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Or do you think that it existed

1010
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
to make sound and images

1011
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and distribute them to users?

1012
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That was practically the only way.

1013
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Later, there were other servers

1014
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and systems,

1015
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
such as Reel,

1016
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and Puzzaboo.

1017
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
At that time,

1018
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
we received a lot of money.

1019
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Americans and Japanese

1020
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
had the same idea

1021
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
to send videos from the Himalayas

1022
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
live.

1023
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But as Andrej told me,

1024
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
they didn't have luck with the weather.

1025
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
They were calculators,

1026
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Nepal alpinists,

1027
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
in the base camp.

1028
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Everything worked at home,

1029
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
but when I came,

1030
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
it didn't work.

1031
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You know, the magic white smoke

1032
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
when it escapes you,

1033
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it's hard to send it back.

1034
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So...

1035
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Davor Korničar had a camera

1036
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
on his cell phone.

1037
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But this wasn't a live stream.

1038
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It was recorded and distributed.

1039
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
We tried to convince him

1040
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
to have a video add-on.

1041
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But he said,

1042
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that he had to move it up

1043
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
to the top of the hill.

1044
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It wouldn't work.

1045
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Actually,

1046
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
it was the first live video stream

1047
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
from the Himalayas in history.

1048
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Andrej and I did it.

1049
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
CNN came to interview us.

1050
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We had a 5-minute interview

1051
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
on CNN about how we did it.

1052
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The Americans said

1053
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
they needed a few million dollars

1054
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
to make the first live video stream.

1055
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
They were not surprised

1056
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that two Slovenians

1057
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
with the same equipment

1058
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
as it was,

1059
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
managed to do it.

1060
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That's how it was.

1061
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I think they were just worried

1062
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
about the impact of the humidity.

1063
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But it's not enough.

1064
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's not enough,

1065
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
but we have to overcomplicate it.

1066
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The more elements you have,

1067
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
the more things can go wrong.

1068
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I think they had two problems.

1069
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Power management.

1070
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
They had too little

1071
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
generation of energy,

1072
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and too much use.

1073
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That's why there was no humidity in the city.

1074
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think we need to add

1075
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
a very important factor.

1076
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's very simple to be smart.

1077
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
At an altitude of 5,000-5,300 meters,

1078
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
if you go higher,

1079
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
the air is like breathing through a straw.

1080
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You do all these things.

1081
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Frost, humidity,

1082
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
you didn't even try to test it,

1083
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
but it comes through experience.

1084
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
On the other hand,

1085
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
you have a technical partner

1086
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
who understands not only technology,

1087
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
but also alpinism.

1088
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
At that altitude,

1089
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
as far as I understand,

1090
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
the capacity of thinking

1091
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
would easily lead to some smart moves.

1092
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Always.

1093
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's like a playbook.

1094
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You work on a playbook,

1095
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and now you have to figure out

1096
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
what is the best and unique task.

1097
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You are a younger generation

1098
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
on the war.

1099
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
At that time, it was pioneering.

1100
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
We were researching sports,

1101
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
we were developing sports,

1102
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
we were putting together sports.

1103
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
There was no playbook.

1104
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Playbook was like,

1105
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Andrej, go set it up and stream it.

1106
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That was the playbook.

1107
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Everything else was improvisation.

1108
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Improvisation.

1109
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Improvisation is to that extent.

1110
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If it doesn't work for you,

1111
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
try this or that.

1112
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Of course, it can change.

1113
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
On Saturdays,

1114
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
if something doesn't work,

1115
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
you can double it.

1116
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We had double cards for laptops,

1117
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
so we could double or triple it.

1118
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
On the other hand,

1119
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Andrej could jump

1120
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
to 6,000 meters

1121
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
on his own,

1122
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
with a tent and everything he needed.

1123
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
He set it all up

1124
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and started streaming.

1125
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It was a superhuman effort.

1126
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
When he set it up,

1127
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
he was on his own.

1128
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes, he was on his own.

1129
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
He was a free spirit.

1130
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
He dressed up,

1131
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
put on his backpack,

1132
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
set up the tent,

1133
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
had a drink,

1134
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and went to 6,000 meters.

1135
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
That's how it all started.

1136
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It wasn't that simple.

1137
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Even today,

1138
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
with today's technology,

1139
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't know how many people

1140
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
would be able to do it.

1141
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That's true,

1142
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
but today we have

1143
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
better technology,

1144
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and we can reach a wider audience.

1145
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm not saying that you can fly

1146
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
certain drones,

1147
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and solve the problem that way.

1148
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Where are the drones?

1149
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I don't think the army has them yet.

1150
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I would like to tell you

1151
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
to take a breath,

1152
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
drink a glass of water,

1153
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and stay in that space.

1154
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
We can't bring in any liquids.

1155
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We also turned off the air conditioner.

1156
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
We're halfway through,

1157
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
and I would like to thank

1158
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
the Research Museum

1159
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
for their support.

1160
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
They will help us expand

1161
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
this space.

1162
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I would also like to thank Caldeo,

1163
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
3FSL, Human Frogs,

1164
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
and everyone else who supports us

1165
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
through Patreon.

1166
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Thank you all.

1167
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Join us on Patreon,

1168
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and you'll see some of the people.

1169
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
That's it.

1170
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We don't have a live stream yet.

1171
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What you're watching now

1172
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
is recorded, uploaded,

1173
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
and you can download it.

1174
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
When Elon Musk

1175
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
installed Starlink,

1176
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and when he installed

1177
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
the Starlink modem,

1178
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
which is practically everywhere in the world,

1179
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
you can find it on the Internet,

1180
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
there's a link to it.

1181
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,320
You can see the evolution of how you experienced the communication with different parts of the world.

1182
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:20,799
Did the lessons you got here with those two or three experiences, did they influence your career?

1183
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:27,520
Did you see that people upgraded those parts? Because it seems to me that from what we have now, I don't know,

1184
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:35,840
Starlink in the Amazon rainforests, some time has passed. How do you see this evolution? Maybe a little more about that.

1185
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:42,880
Yes, the development of these parts is going forward, but nothing can replace optics.

1186
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:58,240
The satellite can have a wide range, but you will not be able to force physics how much time your package takes to the satellite and back.

1187
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:09,440
There is a lot of latency here. I greet the satellite technology for those parts where there is no optics at the moment,

1188
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:17,199
where there is no network and so on. To include those billions of people in the world who are not yet included.

1189
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:29,360
But I don't know if this is a permanent solution. At a meeting we had a few years ago, a lady from the European Commission came,

1190
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:36,720
because there was a lot of hype about wireless, wireless, wireless, everything must be wireless and so on, mobile, mobile.

1191
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:53,519
I told her, the air has its own physical laws, it is a shared media, and we can all develop wireless to some extent,

1192
00:51:53,519 --> 00:52:05,839
but it has its own physical laws. She asked me what is the solution. I said, take a bugger and start digging.

1193
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:17,679
Now you have optics, so you can rely on them. This is the only way we will reach the right capacity for internet transport around the world.

1194
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:28,559
In fact, we can solve those really difficult areas where there is no such thing yet, but my advice is, take a bugger and start digging.

1195
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,520
It will be difficult in the Himalayas, but OK.

1196
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,520
You go 6,000 meters and then you wait for the optical cable and then you plug it in.

1197
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:45,839
No, they already have it up there. In the base camp you already have wireless providers, I don't know, you pay $10, I don't know how much you pay for a whole week.

1198
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,839
It's up there now, as simple as that. It wasn't even 20 years ago.

1199
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,839
Of course.

1200
00:52:52,160 --> 00:53:02,960
Up there, they also promoted connectivity with energy. I don't know how they solved it.

1201
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,000
I mean, it's true that there are lower bases than on the mountains.

1202
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yes, yes.

1203
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:21,360
Solar panels are a technology. Solar panels are being promoted, used, when you need energy, for example, with some new laptops.

1204
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:28,960
Today, you can do almost anything from a phone, and all of a sudden you switch to a smaller power supply.

1205
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:40,399
So, from that perspective, if you said it before, the problem is that today there are more technical solutions, or more possibilities to solve the problem.

1206
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:42,399
Yes.

1207
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:44,399
No, it's not possible.

1208
00:53:44,399 --> 00:53:46,399
Definitely.

1209
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:55,440
I mean, just the fact that today you can put a lot of things in your pocket, and no longer in a backpack, so you're not up there.

1210
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,440
Yes.

1211
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:04,880
Can you tell us more about that wedge you brought up there?

1212
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,320
Yes, that's a wedge that Tomas had. Tomas went up there, he didn't go solo.

1213
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:16,720
He didn't have any crazy conversations, maybe he sang somewhere while he was resting.

1214
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:25,839
Or maybe he was in a bit of a difficult situation, but he didn't go up there.

1215
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:37,200
And he had, as far as I understood him, one of those wedges, for example, that he would have to abseil back down.

1216
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:46,799
That is, if he had to stop the mission and go back down, he had one of those wedges and a rope.

1217
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:58,959
But we calculated that it was about 400 meters, or 300 meters, how much he could go back down with those wedges.

1218
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:10,959
That means that when he came across that wall, it was pointless to abseil down, because he simply didn't come to where he could go forward without warning.

1219
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:19,519
And when he came back home, he gave me one of those wedges, I don't know if it was gold or what, it looked like gold up there.

1220
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,519
It wasn't like that originally.

1221
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,519
And he wrote up there, what did he write?

1222
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:34,160
Here he gave me a engraving, Tomas Humar, Southwall of the Laguerre, 1999, and his signature.

1223
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:48,880
And he gave it to me, he brought it to me, we were friends through all those projects, he said, Jan, here you will be able to remember this wedge that went over the Southwall of the Laguerre.

1224
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:59,440
He said, fortunately, I needed it, I don't know if I needed it in the wall, because it looks like something new, and then he rubbed it.

1225
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,440
I think it's polished, yes.

1226
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:08,399
But it was one of the wedges that was in the wall up there.

1227
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:10,399
I think it's nice.

1228
00:56:10,399 --> 00:56:22,399
He also brought me a book at the time, and he signed his book inside, and he wrote, dedicated, and I said, what do you have to wait for a book, he destroyed the book.

1229
00:56:22,399 --> 00:56:28,399
Now I'm happy, now I'm happy that he wrote to me.

1230
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:49,359
And he wrote exactly what was the essence of this project in the Laguerre, as he wrote, even if we are short of wedges, the PGC society is made up of people, it remains as it is.

1231
00:56:50,320 --> 00:57:06,320
And that's exactly what we did at the time, from the fallen hardware and practically into the trash.

1232
00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:19,279
I mean, we had better hardware in Karničar, but that was practically when the three of us would look at what we had at home, on the walls, and put something together.

1233
00:57:19,279 --> 00:57:29,279
But I didn't look at it at home, probably not even at the hardware market.

1234
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,239
And you had, at the time, on Siolu, for that time, Latest Greatest.

1235
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:36,239
Yes.

1236
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,239
Maybe there was an encyclopedic category, maybe even better hardware, but it was about the same, bigger and heavier.

1237
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,239
Yes, that was for the server part.

1238
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:54,239
I mean, that was my official laptop, which I said I had already lived without for a month, when we got it there at Siolu at the time.

1239
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,200
But that was how it was.

1240
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,200
Until then, the shipment didn't go there.

1241
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,200
Until then, we didn't do the first tests, which Andrej set up, we all went to Kathmandu.

1242
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Then I realized that we had a problem with the price per minute.

1243
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,200
I said, I'll call you at home.

1244
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:24,160
Don't make fun of him, he has to explain this to his wife.

1245
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:36,159
When the phone bill came, I think it was the military bill of a smaller African country.

1246
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,119
At that time, at Siolu, I made sure that Siolu supported it.

1247
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:49,119
And then it turned out that those minutes were covered, plus the complete use of servers and my time.

1248
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:59,119
Because then Siolu saw that when the Siolu badge appeared on humor.com, and when the media grabbed it, it was a whole thing.

1249
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:06,080
Then the whole PR department joined the action and did a whole thing out of it.

1250
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,080
That's how stories are written.

1251
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:14,080
Yes, but it all started with a group of citizens, as the locals say.

1252
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Now we are in the cellar of the Computer Museum.

1253
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,080
You decided to sell this laptop to the Computer Museum.

1254
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,039
I think, looking at the exhibits that we saw today,

1255
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:33,039
everything that fits into this atmosphere,

1256
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:37,039
I think they will take good care of it.

1257
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,039
I mean, I know they will take good care of it.

1258
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:49,039
I'm really curious, what message do you want to convey with this laptop?

1259
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I think it's part of the Slovenian Internet history.

1260
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I haven't heard about it for a long time.

1261
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
In fact, my wife Tatjana told me about it some time ago.

1262
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
She said, what are you going to do with this laptop?

1263
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I said, I have no idea.

1264
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,960
She said, it's not for the Computer Museum.

1265
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,960
I said, maybe it's not a bad idea.

1266
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,960
Then I called Tomaž Humare Mlajšević, Tomaž's son.

1267
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:42,960
I said, listen, let's see if they are interested in the museum.

1268
01:00:43,919 --> 01:00:45,919
He said, let's go one day,

1269
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:47,919
I'll take it to them,

1270
01:00:47,919 --> 01:00:49,919
we'll take some selfies,

1271
01:00:49,919 --> 01:00:51,919
and then we'll go.

1272
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:53,919
A message for me, of course.

1273
01:00:57,919 --> 01:01:01,919
I think I will take it to Tomaž.

1274
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:03,919
I brought it a bit.

1275
01:01:04,919 --> 01:01:07,919
Are you going to add anything to that?

1276
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,880
I'm a bit in a hurry.

1277
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,880
In the sphere of the creation of the Slovenian Internet,

1278
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,880
you deserve a lot of praise for your work.

1279
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,880
If not, you deserve to be supported,

1280
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,840
to be provided with a link,

1281
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,840
or a server,

1282
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,840
to be able to share your work.

1283
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Thank you very much.

1284
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,840
Maybe some people don't even know

1285
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,840
about your pioneering work,

1286
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,840
how things worked in the past,

1287
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,840
and that they worked not only artificially.

1288
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,799
Yes, in fact,

1289
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,799
it was very pioneering,

1290
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,799
and without any political connotations,

1291
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,799
it was done in a very partisan way.

1292
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,799
We simply said,

1293
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,799
let's try to do it.

1294
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,799
We were young,

1295
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,799
we had a lot of energy,

1296
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,799
and we wanted to do it.

1297
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,760
We went into action.

1298
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,760
With this project,

1299
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
the live streaming project,

1300
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,760
when did you realize

1301
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,760
who is the international leader

1302
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,760
in some of the tasks

1303
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,760
you are doing?

1304
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,760
I think it's a very important question.

1305
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,760
I think it's a very important question.

1306
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,719
Did you prepare for some other project

1307
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:00,719
that brought such a revolution

1308
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:02,719
on the Internet,

1309
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,719
or a continuation of it?

1310
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:06,719
In fact, no.

1311
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,719
This humorous project

1312
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:12,719
led to the decision

1313
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:14,719
to go to Lodz

1314
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:16,719
in order to cover myself

1315
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:18,719
with pictures

1316
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:20,719
so that I could test

1317
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:22,719
live video streaming

1318
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:25,679
which then led

1319
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:27,679
to Davo Karničarja,

1320
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,679
who was really

1321
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:31,679
the first person

1322
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:33,679
in the world.

1323
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:35,679
Then,

1324
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,679
after a while,

1325
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:39,679
it happened

1326
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:41,679
that we decided

1327
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,679
to cancel

1328
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:45,679
this

1329
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:47,679
Trans-Australia Foot Race.

1330
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:49,679
Dušan Mravlje

1331
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:51,679
was running

1332
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,640
in this race

1333
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,640
across Australia.

1334
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,640
Andrej was no longer healthy,

1335
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,640
but he went to PeeBee.

1336
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,640
PeeBee,

1337
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,640
the legend of Siola.

1338
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,640
PeeBee and I went down

1339
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,640
to Australia.

1340
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,640
I set up

1341
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,640
a complete system down there,

1342
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,640
we went there,

1343
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,640
we tested everything.

1344
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,599
I was PeeBee's translator.

1345
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,599
After a while,

1346
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,599
I was down there with them

1347
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,599
when the race started

1348
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,599
and everything was being prepared

1349
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,599
across Australia,

1350
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,599
via satellite and everything.

1351
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,599
Then I flew back

1352
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,599
and set up the server

1353
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
and everything else

1354
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,599
that was needed

1355
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,599
to make it work.

1356
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,599
Then we wanted

1357
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,559
to do streaming

1358
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,559
from an underwater cave.

1359
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,559
It didn't work out

1360
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,559
because

1361
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,559
the gear on Siola changed a bit.

1362
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,559
They were prepared

1363
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,559
that it would be too dangerous

1364
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,559
because underwater

1365
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,559
cave diving

1366
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,559
is not among

1367
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,559
the most dangerous sports

1368
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,559
on this planet.

1369
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,559
It's a coincidence

1370
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
that I came here.

1371
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,520
Yes, but the problem was different.

1372
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,520
Tomas jumped in the cave.

1373
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,520
Davo jumped in the Everest.

1374
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,520
Jan would go in the cave

1375
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,520
to dive.

1376
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Jan would go in the cave.

1377
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,520
So Jan took care

1378
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,520
of his life.

1379
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,520
No, Siola took care of my life.

1380
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:50,479
Jan was crazy enough to say that.

1381
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,479
I'm a technical diver,

1382
01:05:52,479 --> 01:05:54,479
certified.

1383
01:05:58,479 --> 01:06:00,479
I was not crazy enough,

1384
01:06:00,479 --> 01:06:02,479
but self-assured

1385
01:06:02,479 --> 01:06:04,479
that I would put

1386
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:06,479
all the technical equipment

1387
01:06:06,479 --> 01:06:08,479
on a double bottle

1388
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:10,479
and additional aluminum

1389
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:12,479
for decompression

1390
01:06:12,479 --> 01:06:14,479
and camera in my hand

1391
01:06:14,479 --> 01:06:16,479
and go to the cave

1392
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,440
but then

1393
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,440
Siola decided

1394
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,440
that it's not necessary.

1395
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,440
I wanted to say

1396
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,440
that I didn't recognize it

1397
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,440
and I wanted to say

1398
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,440
that the equipment was cheap

1399
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
and available.

1400
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,440
Then our paths

1401
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,440
with Siola changed.

1402
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,440
At the same time

1403
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,440
I went to

1404
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,440
Select Technology

1405
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,400
to transfer my knowledge

1406
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,400
from Reel Audio Video

1407
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,400
to making the first

1408
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
video portal for RTV.

1409
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,400
It was a complete system

1410
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,400
that digitized

1411
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,400
Reel Audio Video files

1412
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,400
in real time

1413
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,400
and then streamed

1414
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,400
from the server outside

1415
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
and then there was a base

1416
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
where you could search

1417
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400
for recordings and so on.

1418
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:15,359
We did it for RTV

1419
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,359
and then RTV used it

1420
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,359
for a while

1421
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,359
and then

1422
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,359
flash media came out

1423
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,359
and so on.

1424
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,359
Then it was split in two.

1425
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,359
You pulled out

1426
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,359
some archaic technology.

1427
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,359
I don't know

1428
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,359
but what we were talking about

1429
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,359
and what you mentioned

1430
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,359
was before YouTube.

1431
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,359
Before YouTube started

1432
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,319
Where was YouTube?

1433
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,319
Maybe that too.

1434
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,319
Flash.

1435
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,319
When we were talking

1436
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,319
about Humor

1437
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,319
2000 and so on.

1438
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,319
When you went to Page

1439
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,319
there was no

1440
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,319
Flash player.

1441
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,319
There was

1442
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,319
a media player

1443
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,319
with a computer

1444
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,319
and a program

1445
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,319
not in a browser

1446
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,280
I don't know if it was possible

1447
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280
to embed it

1448
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,280
in Humor.

1449
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,280
There was a plugin

1450
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,280
for a browser

1451
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,280
and I was not for all browsers.

1452
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,280
Internet Explorer 4

1453
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,280
had some value.

1454
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Netscape communicator.

1455
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,280
The most important thing

1456
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,280
was to click on the link

1457
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,280
and then the real player opened

1458
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,280
and then the player was inside

1459
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,280
and it broadcasted everything

1460
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,239
If you were to fly

1461
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:44,239
in a submarine

1462
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:46,239
from Prague

1463
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:48,239
how different

1464
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:50,239
would the setup be?

1465
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,239
You don't need satellites

1466
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,239
but what would you stream?

1467
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:56,239
How would you fly?

1468
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,239
I would fly

1469
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,239
in a cable

1470
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,239
that I would pull.

1471
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,239
You could pull a cable for yourself.

1472
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,239
Because you are connected

1473
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:08,239
when you swim in a hole.

1474
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,239
You are not connected.

1475
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:12,239
You are pulling a cable.

1476
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:14,239
In this case, I could have a setup

1477
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:16,239
in front of me where I would

1478
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,239
set up a hole

1479
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:20,239
with a rope

1480
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,239
that is a security rope.

1481
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:24,239
I mean a safety rope

1482
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:26,239
in a hole

1483
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,239
with additional flashes

1484
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:30,239
on the ground

1485
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,239
so that I don't touch the ground

1486
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,239
with my foot.

1487
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:36,239
And yes,

1488
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,239
I could somehow

1489
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:40,239
pull this camera

1490
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:42,239
underwater

1491
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:44,239
and I could probably have

1492
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:46,239
a whole team of people

1493
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,239
behind me

1494
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:50,239
to pull the cable

1495
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:52,239
underwater

1496
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,239
but wirelessly

1497
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:56,239
because it doesn't work.

1498
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,239
No.

1499
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,239
Now,

1500
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,239
if someone would pull the cable

1501
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,239
forward

1502
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,239
and then

1503
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,239
it wouldn't work anymore

1504
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,239
because you have a cable in the hole.

1505
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,239
I see that you have already

1506
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,239
thought a lot about it.

1507
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,239
You probably thought about a hole,

1508
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,239
an underwater hole.

1509
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,239
Yes, yes.

1510
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:22,239
You know I don't remember anything.

1511
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,239
I don't remember anything.

1512
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,239
But I think there was one

1513
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,239
Slovenian interesting hole.

1514
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,239
I don't know if it was Suhadolc

1515
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,239
or I don't know where.

1516
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,239
Underwater or live video stream.

1517
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,239
You would like to watch that.

1518
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,239
Yes, I don't know.

1519
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,239
Yes, I mean...

1520
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,239
That time?

1521
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,239
That time definitely.

1522
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,239
I mean, you didn't have YouTube

1523
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,239
that time.

1524
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,239
You didn't have Instagram,

1525
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,239
you didn't have TikTok, Facebook.

1526
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,239
Nothing.

1527
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,239
Nothing.

1528
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,239
Yes, you had

1529
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,239
TV.

1530
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,239
With teletext.

1531
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,239
Yes, somehow.

1532
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,239
I mean,

1533
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,239
it's interesting because we talk about it

1534
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,239
all the time,

1535
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,239
in front of GoPro cameras,

1536
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,239
in front of mobile phones,

1537
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,239
in front of many networks.

1538
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,239
No, there were mobile phones.

1539
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,239
Nokia 61.

1540
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,239
Yes, yes.

1541
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,239
But phones were

1542
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,239
bigger bricks.

1543
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,239
They had the ability

1544
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,239
to last for a year.

1545
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,239
One week.

1546
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,239
One week.

1547
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,239
You will see

1548
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,239
how in the first album.

1549
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,239
And in mobile phones.

1550
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,239
In the history

1551
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,239
of Slovenian streaming.

1552
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,239
No, I wanted

1553
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,239
more that.

1554
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,239
Because you

1555
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,239
from

1556
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,239
Internet Society and so on.

1557
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,239
If you prepared

1558
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,239
like that,

1559
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,239
if the

1560
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:06,239
streaming service

1561
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,239
or streaming

1562
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,239
at the level of the protocol,

1563
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,239
how much

1564
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,239
did it develop?

1565
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,239
Or did you accidentally join

1566
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,239
some working group

1567
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,239
that drew something

1568
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,239
from the protocol?

1569
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,239
I don't know.

1570
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,239
Multicasting and so on.

1571
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,239
I was in some small group

1572
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,239
on IETF.

1573
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,239
We talked about it.

1574
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,239
But then,

1575
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,239
when I left IOL,

1576
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,239
when I was on Select,

1577
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,239
I went more

1578
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,239
in the direction of my friend,

1579
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,239
I would say,

1580
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,239
IPv6.

1581
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,239
So,

1582
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,239
when you were streaming IPv6,

1583
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,239
it didn't go through IPv6?

1584
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,239
No, it didn't.

1585
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,239
I counted.

1586
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,239
That's provocative.

1587
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,239
Actually,

1588
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,239
my first

1589
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:08,239
IPv6 stick

1590
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,239
was there in 1997.

1591
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,239
I downloaded

1592
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,239
a patch

1593
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,239
from Sun Playground

1594
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,239
on IOL.

1595
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:20,239
It was a tunnel to Sixbone,

1596
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,239
which was an experimental network.

1597
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,239
I could ping over sixes

1598
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,239
and stuff in Sixbone.

1599
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,239
Of course,

1600
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,239
no DNS, no servers,

1601
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,239
no Apache.

1602
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,239
But I could ping

1603
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,239
and some names answered.

1604
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,239
My first stick was there

1605
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,239
in 2000.

1606
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,239
It was nice

1607
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,239
to have ErzBouncer,

1608
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,239
who introduced himself as IPv6.

1609
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,239
IPv6!

1610
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,239
He was that jack,

1611
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,239
who had a slightly different IP

1612
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,239
when he was on the channel.

1613
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,239
Or if you had

1614
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,239
reverse DNS installed.

1615
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,239
Yes, I had my own reverse DNS.

1616
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,239
If we're talking about IPv6,

1617
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,239
it was something different.

1618
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,239
So,

1619
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,239
after I left

1620
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,239
Select,

1621
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,239
I started working with Dumenco.

1622
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,239
I went

1623
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,239
back a little

1624
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,239
in that direction.

1625
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,239
Then we did Go6,

1626
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,239
a competition for IPv6 promotion

1627
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,239
and implementation.

1628
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,239
We pushed forward

1629
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,239
all together.

1630
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,239
Then we

1631
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,239
somehow transformed

1632
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,239
the community

1633
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,239
we built

1634
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,239
from 2.8 onwards

1635
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,239
into Synog,

1636
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,239
which is today

1637
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,239
also a

1638
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,239
morph.

1639
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,239
At one point,

1640
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,239
I realized that

1641
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,239
anyone who has a phone

1642
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,239
can stream

1643
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,239
from anywhere.

1644
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,239
It didn't

1645
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,239
take long

1646
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,239
for me

1647
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,239
to realize

1648
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,239
that this

1649
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,239
was a

1650
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Let's talk about things that are interesting, that need some kind of help,

1651
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,000
some kind of drive, some kind of awareness.

1652
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Here you have the example of technology, the technological challenge.

1653
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
The main thing in this challenge is the content.

1654
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Did you have a content that was interesting for you?

1655
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Today, there is a network, everyone is talking to each other,

1656
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
or a ping is sent. Boring.

1657
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
If you have content that needs to be sent out,

1658
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
and it needs to be served to a mass,

1659
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
all these challenges are also technologically interesting.

1660
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yes, but it can be special.

1661
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:02,000
If we were to bring some plants from the base camp,

1662
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
maybe everyone would look at it, because there was so little of it.

1663
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But I don't think it would be as interesting as Davo Karničar,

1664
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
who flies from the top of Mount Everest.

1665
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
What are your interesting challenges that you see now?

1666
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
What are you excited about now?

1667
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I'm still working on IPv6 in the world.

1668
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
It's always more operational.

1669
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Everything is happening day-to-day.

1670
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And now, for example, Google is making measurements

1671
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
of all traffic to all its services.

1672
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I think that around 50% of the world's traffic

1673
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
comes through IPv6.

1674
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So it's not some obscure experiment

1675
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
with some scientists.

1676
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,000
It's an operational protocol that lives in the real Internet.

1677
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Now we have more and more of this curve.

1678
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
So it's a big problem for me as an operator

1679
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
who hasn't implemented it yet.

1680
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
What else is a challenge?

1681
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Are we talking about the implementation itself,

1682
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
integrating it?

1683
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Or is it a challenge from the point of view of the protocol

1684
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and the application?

1685
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
You can understand that IPv6 is a protocol

1686
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
that was founded in 1996 or 1995.

1687
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's not ideal.

1688
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
It's still being improved a bit.

1689
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But it's good enough that it can follow

1690
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
any moment of IPv4.

1691
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And it's already following it.

1692
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I don't know how to say it.

1693
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Until now, it was a challenge in CPE equipment.

1694
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
People call it a modem.

1695
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
But it's getting better.

1696
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
But there's still an elephant in the room.

1697
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And it's people's disappointment

1698
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,000
or the thought that if something is not broken,

1699
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
don't touch it.

1700
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And we still need it.

1701
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
We have enough of it.

1702
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It means blind spots.

1703
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I may have said too much.

1704
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But I think that some generation of networkers

1705
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
will have to retire.

1706
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And the younger generation will have to come

1707
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
to show some difference.

1708
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
That's what I've been trying to do from the beginning.

1709
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But do you really think that today's young people

1710
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
will need this strip?

1711
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Because I see it from the other end.

1712
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
When we have a deal with some young systems

1713
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
that mostly screw cloud services

1714
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
or develop some software or SaaS products.

1715
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Very rarely I hear that I've turned on IPv6.

1716
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Or that I've touched IPv6.

1717
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I don't see it that often.

1718
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
It depends on the teacher and the mentor.

1719
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
For example, for the last 20 years,

1720
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I've been designing all the networks

1721
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and the architecture.

1722
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
They were made for IPv6 architecture.

1723
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And then you add IPv4 at the end.

1724
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And I'm still learning.

1725
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I want to say that today all the big cloud providers

1726
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
allow dual-stack or the possibility

1727
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
to have IPv6 as a healthy network.

1728
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
But it's up to the user to click on it.

1729
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Now certain providers will go in that direction

1730
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
that IPv6 will be paid by default and IPv4 will be paid.

1731
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
But it seems to me that even among young people

1732
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I haven't noticed that it's now.

1733
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Let's go to the last one.

1734
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
We've talked about it.

1735
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
In the final phase,

1736
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I don't mean the engineers,

1737
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
but the end users,

1738
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
everything is working.

1739
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
The technology is hidden.

1740
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
The Internet has become like electricity or water.

1741
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
When you buy a fan in a store,

1742
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
you come home, turn it on and it works.

1743
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
When you turn on the water, it has to flow out of the pipe.

1744
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
The Internet is similar.

1745
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
IPv6 is not a thing of the end user.

1746
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
The end user needs to be able to open Facebook, Google,

1747
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
whatever he clicks on.

1748
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It's a thing of the operators.

1749
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I want to say that.

1750
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
We've talked about services,

1751
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
and if I'm not mistaken,

1752
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
it's a live show,

1753
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
because the end user will be interested in the content.

1754
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
If there's a dual laptop with cables,

1755
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
the end user doesn't care about that.

1756
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That's the difference between

1757
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
developers, engineers,

1758
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
and the general public,

1759
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
who are interested in the personality.

1760
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
You also have to know

1761
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
if you're fully excited to watch a TV show.

1762
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
If you watch a TV show...

1763
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
There was a time

1764
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
when you could watch a TV show

1765
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
if you knew exactly what was going on.

1766
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
You could quickly go to the data.

1767
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
You could watch a TV show on your phone

1768
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
and not have to open it in 15 days,

1769
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
because maybe you didn't have that much time.

1770
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I agree with that.

1771
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
But for Loki,

1772
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
who graduated from high school in 2000,

1773
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
or was on his way to college,

1774
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
internet technology was probably new at the time.

1775
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
You were more excited,

1776
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
it was more interesting.

1777
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
You probably didn't care about teletext,

1778
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
you cared about the internet.

1779
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Our generation probably has a lot of protocols,

1780
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and they are given.

1781
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Water flows, electricity comes.

1782
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Even when they took out the phone,

1783
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
everyone was excited to be able to connect it.

1784
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
That's the thing.

1785
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Everyone who was stimulated

1786
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
when we started to talk about technology,

1787
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
was like,

1788
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I need to go back to the side.

1789
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
We wanted to release some content.

1790
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Let's say it was a technological challenge.

1791
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
To frame them inside.

1792
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
The idea was to release some content.

1793
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
You can show that to your elders,

1794
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
to your friends.

1795
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
You can't just configure a Linux server

1796
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
and send it up.

1797
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I used to do that.

1798
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's a rabbit hole.

1799
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Shoutout to our audience.

1800
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
People are listening to us

1801
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
and watching us.

1802
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
We have a bigger community on our Discord.

1803
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
It's very active,

1804
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
it's very fun.

1805
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I think there are people

1806
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
who are genuinely interested in technology.

1807
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
There are people

1808
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
who see it as an interesting universe

1809
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
of some things,

1810
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and are looking for networking,

1811
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
mobile, Linux.

1812
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I see young people are still

1813
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
using it all over the place.

1814
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I think there are more offers

1815
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
and choices.

1816
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
We talked about Windows XP,

1817
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
or maybe Linux.

1818
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Today, if I had a laptop,

1819
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I could do anything.

1820
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
There are more offers and choices.

1821
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
On the other hand,

1822
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
we have a bigger audience.

1823
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
We used to have millions of people

1824
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
watching our streams.

1825
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Today, if we had good content,

1826
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
there would be millions of people.

1827
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
The world has become more connected

1828
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and more decisive.

1829
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Today, if you do a live stream

1830
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
from a concert,

1831
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
you get a special reward.

1832
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
This always fascinates me.

1833
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It doesn't matter

1834
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
how high-quality phones are.

1835
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Why do people record concerts?

1836
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It's their best piece,

1837
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
and they record it.

1838
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Do you send it to them?

1839
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Yes, I do.

1840
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Do you post it on Instagram?

1841
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Or is it a personal choice?

1842
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I do it from time to time.

1843
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I do it to support a friend

1844
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
who wants to go to a concert,

1845
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
but doesn't want to.

1846
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Another reason why I do it

1847
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
is if it's a band

1848
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and I'm trying to play the guitar,

1849
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
and I don't know how it goes,

1850
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
so I record it to see how he plays it.

1851
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Then I enlarge it at home.

1852
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
That's what he likes.

1853
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I dream that in the hall

1854
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
of 10,000 people,

1855
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
all those 7,000 people

1856
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
who record it,

1857
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I dream about it.

1858
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Can I ask you one last question?

1859
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
We're talking about young people

1860
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
and their successors.

1861
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I wanted to ask you

1862
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
how you deal with young people.

1863
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I think you have a son

1864
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
who is very popular in this world.

1865
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Yes, the youngest son, Max Jakob.

1866
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Last time you gave me his github,

1867
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I looked at it.

1868
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
When he was 13,

1869
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
he wrote his own programming language.

1870
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
The others didn't like it.

1871
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
They weren't fast enough.

1872
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It's all very Slovenian.

1873
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Yes.

1874
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
He decided that he didn't like

1875
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
that Python is too slow.

1876
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
He didn't like that C++

1877
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
is a bit clumsy with coding.

1878
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
He was ready to write

1879
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
his own programming language.

1880
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I told him to look at the source code

1881
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
of C++, how it's done.

1882
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
He said he would like to start from scratch.

1883
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
He got into it.

1884
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
First he wrote the syntax.

1885
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Then he prepared it.

1886
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Of course, he learned how to assemble.

1887
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Before that, he wrote a bootloader

1888
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
for his operating system,

1889
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
which he's writing now,

1890
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
because the others aren't good enough.

1891
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I told him that he has too much hardware

1892
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
in the world to support it.

1893
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I told him that I would transform

1894
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
my code and syntax into assemblies.

1895
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
He started to reverse-engineer

1896
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
from his own needs.

1897
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Then he wrote Lexar and Parsar.

1898
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
You wouldn't know what Lexar and Parsar are.

1899
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Then he implemented

1900
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
different if-inputs.

1901
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
He gave me a package

1902
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
so that I could install everything together.

1903
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Install package, documentation, everything.

1904
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I think he was about 15 years old

1905
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
when he started to work with it.

1906
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Then he started to write other things.

1907
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Then he worked with graphics cards

1908
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
and some drivers.

1909
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Then he graduated.

1910
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
He worked in a high school in Škofa Loka.

1911
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
When he decided where to go next,

1912
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
he decided to go into mathematics.

1913
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Pure mathematics.

1914
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I asked him why,

1915
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
because he was a programmer.

1916
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
He told me that he was already used to it

1917
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
and that he lacked mathematics.

1918
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
He told me that if I wanted to be a programmer,

1919
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
a coder,

1920
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
an encryption engineer,

1921
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
you need mathematics.

1922
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
He told me that I don't have any relatives here.

1923
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Now he is happily working

1924
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
as a first-year mathematician

1925
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
and he enjoys it to the fullest.

1926
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
He enjoys it to the fullest.

1927
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
He was very proud.

1928
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Yes, he was at some world olympiads.

1929
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
He brought medals home.

1930
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
He was a leader of a Slovenian team

1931
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
that represented Slovenia

1932
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
at the international...

1933
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I don't know what it's called.

1934
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
The international world olympics.

1935
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
He got a silver medal

1936
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
which was his goal.

1937
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I think that's enough.

1938
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
He left high school

1939
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and now he will surely find another competition.

1940
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I think that if we see him today,

1941
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
luck will be on our side.

1942
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Fortes fortuna jovat!

1943
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
At this moment,

1944
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I would like to thank the EPP

1945
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
for supporting us before our mission.

1946
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I would like to thank Caldi,

1947
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
3FS and Human Frog

1948
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
for supporting us on Patreon.

1949
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
In conclusion,

1950
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I wish that people will find

1951
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
a positive thought

1952
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
in this story.

1953
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That this work will be an inspiration

1954
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
for all of us.

1955
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I would like to thank you

1956
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
for this difficult path

1957
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
that you went through.

1958
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
That's my story.

1959
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I would like to add

1960
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
that for this story

1961
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and all the other stories

1962
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
you need content

1963
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
and technique.

1964
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
But in the end,

1965
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
it's the people who create the content

1966
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and give the technical knowledge

1967
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
and make a good story.

1968
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I mostly see the people

1969
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
who produce the content.

1970
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
That's why it was so interesting

1971
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
for the organization

1972
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
to present this story

1973
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
from a different perspective.

1974
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
The technical aspect

1975
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
and the people.

1976
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
It's not so trivial

1977
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
that someone connected

1978
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
to a satellite in a base camp

1979
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
and a miracle happened.

1980
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You can make a series

1981
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
out of this story.

1982
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
When this story will be released,

1983
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
we have already released

1984
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
three other episodes.

1985
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
They are called

1986
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Extreme Security Monsters.

1987
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
You can check them out.

1988
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
They are also great.

1989
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Thank you, Jan.

1990
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Thank you, Andrash.

1991
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Thank you, Nami.

1992
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Thank you.

1993
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Thank you.
