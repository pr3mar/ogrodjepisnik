00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello Belgrade, it's a little different, we don't know each other yet because I'm on the other side of the lens.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm one dollar, so here I'm filming and watching OTA sitting in my place.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today with me are two other members of the team who are more in the back.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If I'm not mistaken, Tomas is a little more visible, our bringer of light.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello Tomas.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
On my right is a player who is a little more visible because of our branding, stickers, logos.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not my image, is that it?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's true.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
An idea for a successor?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Too little of your image.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, so for 2025...

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Special edition.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
More image.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
More image.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Trend for 2025.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Cool.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today we talked a little.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He gave me the car for his replacement.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know exactly why, but I see that they are preparing in the back if the cameras are recording.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I hope they have something to mount.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, I thought that maybe we should first introduce ourselves as a team from the back,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so that we are a little more noticed, if that was the idea.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So maybe Tomas would start.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I would introduce you...

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think I would thank you a lot.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Seeing that you are everything from a YouTuber to a product developer,

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
now you are competing with me in photography and video and everything.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How would you...

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you have a word for what you are?

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you a creator?

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You know what?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
With women, sometimes in this topic, it is said that they don't know...

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
For example, my wife, when she goes to a friend's party,

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
or to a prayer meeting, she asks me,

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
how does your husband actually start?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And there is always this dilemma.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It is very difficult to put into a box my beginnings or all those interests.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why am I like this?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have no idea.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The man decides at some point that he wants to know something,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and then I go back to it for a month, a year, or just three minutes,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and I make sure it doesn't take and I go on with my life.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So where do I start?

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I mean, in the context of Ogrodje...

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We will come back to Ogrodje.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
For the listeners, I would say that they know me the best,

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I will say publicly, probably on my YouTube channel.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Although it is not a big one, and also not that old,

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but somehow in September, October I decided to share my knowledge,

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
because I always wanted...

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For example, a fun fact about me,

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
in high school I wanted to be a professor of English.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That is an interesting fun fact.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know, for me it is.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
For me too.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then I wanted to be a professor of physics and technology,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
but somehow I didn't keep up with the homework,

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and all those experiments, so I failed,

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
so yes, I always liked the aspect of sharing knowledge.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will also say that when I was with my partner Per,

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
when we established the company,

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
we went to Open Source,

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
because the community aspect was always very close to me.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Although, yes, YouTube, on the one hand,

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you talk a lot, there is no back debate,

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
although I try to respond to as many comments as possible,

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but if a video is good,

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
thousands of comments are made very quickly.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you still follow those comments?

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, yes, yes.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Still?

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, yes, yes, I still try.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I mean, one is like that,

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but when you start, I will say,

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
look, when you start, you create a filter

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
with which you pay to engage completely,

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
because not every comment is worth engagement.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you filter trolls?

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or you don't have them yet?

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Trolls, I will say,

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
sometimes it's okay,

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
they find everything,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you know, I talked to a colleague recently,

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
it's interesting that you always get angry

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
at those comments,

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the most toxic, for some reason.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If he pokes you in the right place.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, yes, yes.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You get, I don't know, 100 comments,

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
out of which 99 are so madly positive,

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and then he pokes you somewhere,

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and then he pulls you out,

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and then you go to sleep,

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and you think about the same thing,

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
which is absolutely not worth your attention.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can't do without it,

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
because you invest so much time,

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and energy, and your creativity,

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and you want it to be well received,

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and it could be really clean,

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to know how to deal with it,

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
but in my opinion it's hard.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, it's hard, I mean,

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can understand, because you're in public,

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and everyone sees you,

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and I'm a very open person,

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
it's hard for me to talk about

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
good and bad things,

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
about my own, I would say,

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
good and bad qualities,

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
but yes, I have some feelings,

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and I have them,

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and they quickly accept them.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Now, when you said,

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
something else about yourself,

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
yes, what did you say,

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
for example, photographer,

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
audio, well, not audio,

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I mean, I enjoy those things,

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
those are topics I'm really interested in,

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and I could go on.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I would have two hitters

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
who would debate about that,

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
about equipment, audio, video, production.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I would go to a coffee shop,

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and you would come with me to the end,

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and I would come back.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I would like to do something like that,

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
because we will still,

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I mean, I hope we will come

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to this field a bit more,

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
if we can get a bit closer to Tomas,

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
if he stands by that.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Tell us a bit more about you,

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
what do you do?

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I won't say that you are a graphic designer,

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
a disc golfer,

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but we know that you are.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes, we can say that,

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we don't know that.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Everything is almost professional.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I mean, it says on the card

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Professional Amateur, so.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, that's it, you have the card.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have the card, yes.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But yes, when it comes to work,

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am a designer-illustrator,

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
or a mix of

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
bigger things.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We already mentioned that,

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
a pastor of some brands.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It means that you work

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
from logos

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to marketing material,

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
to video editing,

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm exaggerating a bit, sorry.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I know, I know.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Everything that comes,

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
which I really like

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
in this freelance field,

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and what's nice is that

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have a lot of fixed pages,

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that I don't have everything

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
new, and that there's not

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
a lot of debating

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
what to do, but the page

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
comes if I need it,

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I know what to do,

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and it's produced.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You do everything.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, everything.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have a question on that point.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
How creatively

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
do you work

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
or do you challenge yourself?

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And maybe this question is

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
correct in this way.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why do I ask you this?

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sometimes you have an idea,

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
or sometimes you have a problem.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If I look at it from a more

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
engineering point of view,

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
it's easy to assess problems

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and solutions.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
By the book, as I said.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But when it seems to me that creative work

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
can be like that,

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and you know,

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it's easy to say

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that you're making a logo

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
for someone,

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and they say,

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
it's too simple,

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know,

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and you'll say,

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you're not going to

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
rush me for that.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I mean,

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I know it doesn't work like that,

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
but a lot of people don't know

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
how much you value

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
your work.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I mean, from a financial point of view.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ah, from a financial point of view.

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We're almost there.

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, no, no.

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How do you approach such things?

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
For example, if I told you,

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
look, I need a logo for my brand,

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
how would you value it?

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And above all,

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
what price would you change

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
so that it wouldn't be known?

216
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because now that it's known,

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I know you'd be like,

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
wing it.

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, I think

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
a lot of people

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
over the years,

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
when you hire them,

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you almost know how much

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
they value you,

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
so that you can value

226
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
internally,

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
how much time it takes,

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
how many resources you need,

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and then on the basis of that,

230
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have some packages,

231
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
where the prices start.

232
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know if anyone noticed,

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but in the beginning,

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
there was a lot of...

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's be honest,

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I worked a lot with start-ups,

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and there was always a problem with them.

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Not financially,

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and then you try to compensate.

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Maybe you start lower,

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but if you can,

242
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
you change for longer.

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But, as you said,

244
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
a standard of quality,

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you probably keep it,

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
regardless of the budget.

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All in?

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Anyway,

249
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
if you want to do the best you can.

250
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So, it doesn't look like

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
if you get less money,

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
maybe

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
in the end it turns out

254
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
that if you have less time,

255
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you change the topic,

256
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
or maybe you give them less iterations,

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
it can lead to something unclean

258
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
in the final phase.

259
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But if you try to do

260
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the best you can

261
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and then

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I personally think

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that brands live through it,

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and when you do something,

265
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you can't say that it's fixed,

266
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
but it still grows

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
through the years,

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
or months, or whatever,

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and other things develop,

270
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
because you don't just have a logo,

271
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you also have other assets,

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
or materials.

273
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If we're talking about that,

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I was thinking a bit later

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
about the topic of the garden

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and our collaboration with the garden,

277
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
but let's go a bit

278
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
to our

279
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
new brand,

280
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
our new logo type, the garden.

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How did you

282
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
get to that?

283
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So, let's say

284
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
it's a no-budget option,

285
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
like most

286
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
other productions, and so on.

287
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's crazy,

288
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
yeah.

289
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It all started when I saw

290
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
what Otto chose as the original logo

291
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
for the garden, and

292
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think I was the number one

293
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
hater of

294
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
that logo

295
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
from the very beginning, especially

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
when he told me he had 300 of them,

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and that he chose

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
exactly that, and I bet

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
there were 10

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
better ones, one of all those 300.

301
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Is that the same original one?

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, that one,

303
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the orange one.

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But that one really touched my heart,

305
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
that new logo type.

306
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's the problem

307
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
with those brands,

308
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
you look at the brand and you think,

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
beep,

310
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
if I screw up something,

311
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
how am I going to fix it,

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
because people are used to it.

313
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We found that through our jingle.

314
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I mean, we all wanted

315
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
to change the jingle, so we both

316
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
worked on it, we gave it to the whole team,

317
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you were absolutely

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
in favor of changing the jingle,

319
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
but somehow we didn't find

320
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
a better one.

321
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's always the same with the jingle,

322
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
with the music, I think we're all on the same page,

323
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
when you have to choose a music for a video,

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
it's not just a rabbit hole.

325
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's a special project.

326
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, it's a special project.

327
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because everyone wants to have

328
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
their own character in the music,

329
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and if you don't, then...

330
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I mean, there are so many sites

331
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
that already have it, and you've heard it a dozen times.

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Someone can comment,

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
do we have a good jingle or not?

334
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't know.

335
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Maybe we'll change it someday.

336
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This one says no.

337
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The one in the back.

338
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We're open to suggestions,

339
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
listeners.

340
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, maybe I'll try the logo.

341
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, the logo.

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The guy in the back asked a question,

343
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
if you didn't hear it,

344
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
because he has to say more about the logo.

345
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Basically, yeah, I had quite simple hands

346
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
when it comes to

347
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
doing something

348
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
that was better.

349
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Then, when you have simple hands,

350
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
on the one hand,

351
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
it can be a big problem

352
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
when you don't have any skills,

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
what and how to do it.

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And then I experimented a bit

355
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
with different typographies,

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and I wanted to

357
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
take the nature of the geeks

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
into the logo,

359
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and then, through some iterations,

360
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
various elements

361
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
appeared.

362
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And then, as I imagined,

363
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
specific

364
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
product information

365
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
were determined,

366
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
which were in place,

367
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and we tried to

368
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
work through some cycles

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
My idea was that

370
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
even though it's a podcast,

371
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and you need some merch,

372
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
some stickers,

373
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
that the logo

374
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is placed so well,

375
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
or the whole brand,

376
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
that you can develop some graphics,

377
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
some banners,

378
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and that when you look at something,

379
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
you know, aha, this is it.

380
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because it has some element

381
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
from the outside.

382
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think you did quite well.

383
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't know what to say.

384
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I really liked it.

385
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And also our merch,

386
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and everything that you can see

387
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
behind all those cables.

388
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I think it's nice to wear

389
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
such merch.

390
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not just

391
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
a logo

392
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
from some company.

393
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's more like a home.

394
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's the thing about

395
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
these logos.

396
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You have an open illustrator,

397
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and you have a bunch of vectors,

398
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and you play around with them,

399
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and you create a gradient,

400
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and it spreads out nicely,

401
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and you're like, wait,

402
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
this will be a bit lonely,

403
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and when you have it,

404
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
it looks cool,

405
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you put it on a mock-up,

406
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and you're like, ok,

407
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
it's something.

408
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And when you print it,

409
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
you see that it looks so good.

410
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I wanted to ask you

411
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
if you work with an illustrator.

412
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
With Adobe.

413
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

414
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I know it is,

415
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
but is it enough?

416
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I started boycotting

417
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Adobe

418
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
in particular.

419
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I started...

420
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't think...

421
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think it's a bit of a dream

422
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
to have thousands of subscribers.

423
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't know.

424
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
At some point,

425
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in my previous company,

426
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
we did...

427
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm not saying this just for Adobe,

428
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
but in general,

429
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you make a subscription,

430
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't know,

431
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
once in January,

432
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I did all the subscription calculations

433
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
for the whole company.

434
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean,

435
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we agreed with a partner

436
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
that at the end of the year

437
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we would save

438
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
30,000 euros.

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So I started

440
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
being more careful

441
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
with all the subscriptions.

442
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I haven't cancelled one yet,

443
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
because I was...

444
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have to say this,

445
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
it's a bit off topic,

446
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but Manscaped.

447
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I got it as a gift,

448
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
but the woman who gave it to me

449
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
could register

450
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
my e-mail there.

451
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And now they sell me

452
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
12, 15 or whatever euros

453
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
for sending me

454
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
a deodorant for

455
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
the Nether region.

456
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I thought you were going to say

457
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
it was sponsored for your YouTube channel.

458
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But that's why

459
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I haven't cancelled it yet.

460
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If there's more software,

461
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
how do you get the license

462
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
for the same version

463
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
to arrive and be finished?

464
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm just joining in here,

465
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
because I've been

466
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
on the Adobe suite

467
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
for about 10 years.

468
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't know if

469
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
it was a one-week transition

470
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
to alternatives.

471
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't mean that the functionality

472
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
is exactly the same.

473
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
When it comes to video equipment,

474
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'd say they're a bit better,

475
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but maybe it's just a matter

476
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
of graphics.

477
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think Adobe is still adding

478
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
AI tools.

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There's a lot of support

480
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
for Photoshop, 3D,

481
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
for example.

482
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you're not working

483
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
in a fixed software,

484
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
it connects to

485
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Illustrator and Vector.

486
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If you want to do it in Photoshop,

487
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Raster or After Effects

488
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
to animate,

489
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I think it's much more connected

490
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to Hit Trigger and its workflow.

491
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
As far as that's concerned.

492
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know.

493
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You'll tell me later.

494
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
For me,

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
it's OK.

496
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Everyone is trying to learn

497
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
not just Adobe or Figma,

498
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but all the smaller apps

499
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
for video editing

500
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
or anything else.

501
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And when you do it,

502
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
you draw a line.

503
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I hope our listeners

504
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
know what we're talking about.

505
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I feel like an outsider

506
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
when it comes to

507
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
the tech sector.

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But I'm short-sighted

509
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
when it comes to

510
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
all these projects.

511
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't know.

512
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
For example,

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
you come to

514
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
these programs,

515
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
more graphically oriented

516
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
to your various projects

517
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
with hardware.

518
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You go to Illustrator

519
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
or to use

520
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Illustrator or Photoshop

521
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
or something like that.

522
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I started my career

523
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
with web design.

524
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm not a designer.

525
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't have...

526
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But in my 20 years,

527
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
it was like that.

528
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If you wanted a website,

529
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
you had to be a web designer.

530
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I learned Photoshop pretty well.

531
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I still know it pretty well today.

532
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But I'm talking about Photoshop

533
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
not as a form of photography,

534
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
but as a form of interface design.

535
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So you cut it out.

536
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes.

537
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And then I wrote CSS.

538
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Those were my beginnings.

539
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
HTML and CSS.

540
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But it first appeared

541
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
in Dreamweaver.

542
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Do you still remember,

543
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
comrades?

544
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I remember.

545
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But now,

546
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I went back to

547
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the back-end scene

548
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and I was a programmer

549
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and a system architect,

550
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
if I may say so.

551
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Now,

552
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
when I took photography more seriously,

553
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
it's still my hobby,

554
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so I won't bother you,

555
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
but I'm really working on it.

556
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I looked for

557
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the most effective way

558
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
to get a picture

559
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
from a camera

560
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
to a place

561
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
where someone will see it.

562
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Social media,

563
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Sprint, whatever.

564
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What's the fastest path?

565
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
For me,

566
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
personally,

567
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I really like the iPad.

568
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I have a mini studio

569
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and I'm ready for

570
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
a direct shooting.

571
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The iPad is directly

572
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
embedded in the camera

573
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and I can take a picture

574
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
through the iPad,

575
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and it goes directly

576
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
into a software called Capture One.

577
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm ready for a full...

578
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Again, I'm not a professional photographer,

579
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
so I don't know.

580
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
A professional would say

581
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
that I'm just playing.

582
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
In the beginning,

583
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
you can hear the standard workflow.

584
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't know how professionals

585
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
deal with this,

586
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
but I like to record

587
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in Capture One,

588
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
then I do initial culling,

589
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and you get 500 pictures

590
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
in 30 minutes.

591
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, it's a basic filter.

592
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes, but I do all of this

593
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
on the iPad until the evening,

594
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
on the couch,

595
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and I like it because

596
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
it's soft,

597
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and you're on the computer all day.

598
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If possible, I also try

599
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
to put a chair in the desk.

600
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And I'm ready

601
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
to come back

602
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to this.

603
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I put filters,

604
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
basic colors,

605
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
light corrections,

606
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
everything on the iPad.

607
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
If I really need to edit the picture,

608
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I put it on the iPad,

609
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and I like this Affinity Photo

610
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
which I also have on the computer,

611
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and I also have Capture One,

612
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the Mac version,

613
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
if I need to.

614
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But for me,

615
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I've already edited a picture

616
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and I put it to print the next day.

617
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I also put it on Dropbox

618
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and I sent it to a retoucher

619
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
online.

620
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You get the same pictures for 5 euros.

621
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's really tasty,

622
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
it's not overdone,

623
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and the pictures are

624
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
very satisfactory.

625
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If we're talking about mobile

626
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
tasks,

627
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I know that

628
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
illustrating on the iPad

629
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
is probably the right thing

630
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
to do,

631
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
but

632
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I mean,

633
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
the workflow,

634
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the iPad?

635
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes, I think

636
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
buying an iPad was one of the better

637
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
things I could do.

638
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Even before,

639
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
when I was a designer

640
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
on the Windows system,

641
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
now when I switched

642
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
to the full

643
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Mac OS,

644
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
the connectivity is even better,

645
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
but the iPad is great

646
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
for making some ideas

647
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
on paper,

648
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
for daily work, illustrations,

649
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
when you're writing, for example,

650
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
before the iPad I had a tablet,

651
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
especially when you have to write down,

652
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and you look up,

653
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and you need some time

654
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
to get used to it,

655
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to write,

656
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
just a little bit.

657
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So, yes,

658
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I think the iPad is great.

659
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Procreate is an app

660
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
that you can use,

661
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
for example,

662
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
this app is great,

663
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
because once you buy it,

664
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and you have a license,

665
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
for example,

666
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
with others,

667
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
it's great,

668
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and it works great.

669
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Now that I have it, I connect it

670
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
to Photoshop.

671
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I can make an iPad as a tablet and I can solve it without any problems.

672
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So I think it's a very good investment.

673
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I also see a lot of such solutions for video,

674
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
with the iPad,

675
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
our cameras would also be able to do it,

676
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
but somehow I got into this workflow where the files,

677
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
this raw video,

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
is a bit heavy for the iPad to be able to do it,

679
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
if not because of the price,

680
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
because we have,

681
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
we've already talked about it,

682
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
about 600 to 800 GB per episode,

683
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
from two cameras.

684
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I don't know what storage the iPad has.

685
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You need a disk for all these tasks,

686
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you need an additional disk.

687
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
As far as that is concerned,

688
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
my new iPad would also know.

689
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I think it could,

690
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
but for me it's spatial,

691
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't have a tablet.

692
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
A little less real estate,

693
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
a little editing, I think.

694
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I mean, you still have DaVinci Resolve for the iPad,

695
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but the timeline you see on,

696
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't know,

697
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
on such a small format,

698
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the question is how productive you can be on it.

699
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I really don't think so.

700
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You don't?

701
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
No.

702
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If anything, you have,

703
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I mean,

704
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
in addition to DaVinci,

705
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
as you mentioned,

706
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
it's just great for smaller screens.

707
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The difference between an iPad 12-inch

708
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and a 25-plus-inch monitor.

709
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I would just say,

710
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
while only standard editing is being done,

711
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
while only cuts are being made,

712
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
nothing special.

713
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now you would have a similar workflow

714
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
when you have to edit it,

715
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
but if it's your first edit,

716
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you can just click on the timeline

717
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and that's it.

718
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I think,

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't know,

720
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
it would be possible to edit on an iPad in December as well.

721
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I can't imagine YouTube,

722
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
because you have to focus a little more.

723
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
No,

724
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I can't,

725
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
but the retention,

726
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
editing,

727
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
no.

728
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But you probably work with more layers,

729
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
so you can do more interesting things.

730
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes.

731
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's not a lot of cross-cutting.

732
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's right.

733
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And when you edit,

734
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
for example,

735
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
lines are inserted,

736
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
you know,

737
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
things like that,

738
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
because on YouTube,

739
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
people have a lot of attention,

740
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
a lot of gold bars,

741
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and,

742
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
look,

743
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
if you don't do something,

744
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and now,

745
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
if you make a talking head video,

746
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
then the camera that shoots you

747
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
is finished.

748
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And now,

749
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
you have to do that,

750
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
in addition to performing in front of the camera,

751
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
to be a little more lively,

752
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
you can also edit.

753
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And I,

754
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
for example,

755
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't know,

756
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I have 32 ultrawide monitors,

757
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and I have another special 4K monitor above it,

758
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
for tools and assets,

759
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and I have a timeline on that big monitor,

760
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and a preview,

761
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and those two,

762
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
you know,

763
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
what you're doing,

764
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
video,

765
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and that preview of those assets,

766
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and above I have those assets,

767
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
power bins,

768
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and all that.

769
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OK, yes.

770
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I think for all those who don't know,

771
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
he was talking about power,

772
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
about DaVinci Resolve,

773
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
for video editing software.

774
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yes,

775
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
very powerful software.

776
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
For Stone,

777
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
for some reason.

778
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
For Stone,

779
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
or then,

780
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
yes,

781
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
the license,

782
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
or the hardware,

783
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
if we compare it to the time,

784
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
it's one time.

785
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I can only cry when I start, right?

786
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes,

787
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
actually.

788
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I think I came to terms with,

789
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't know,

790
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I think DaVinci was 16,

791
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
now it will be 19,

792
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
during beta.

793
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
At that time,

794
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
all the updates are for Stone.

795
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes.

796
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Fully professional,

797
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
it accepts,

798
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
absolutely,

799
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think,

800
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the flow,

801
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
as you said,

802
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the integration from one program to another.

803
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's all in one program.

804
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You don't have,

805
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I mean,

806
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
you don't have a vector,

807
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm not talking about DaVinci,

808
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
it's a combination of Adobe Premiere

809
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and After Effects, right?

810
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
After Effects and Audition.

811
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And Audition,

812
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
of course.

813
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And maybe a little more.

814
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I was talking about graphic programs.

815
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yes,

816
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I know,

817
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
graphics,

818
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
if I'm not mistaken.

819
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But,

820
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
for me,

821
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
DaVinci convinced me the most,

822
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
because I don't have to,

823
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
for everything,

824
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
open a program on my own.

825
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I also remember,

826
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
at that time,

827
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
it had all the Adobe Premiere,

828
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
it had full,

829
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
basic,

830
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
when it comes to color correction.

831
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I know you needed some plugins,

832
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
to make it work better.

833
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
DaVinci was already all over the place.

834
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
In addition,

835
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
it had a full license on the camera.

836
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes,

837
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
that's great.

838
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean,

839
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
if you buy it,

840
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't know,

841
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
it's 300 euros,

842
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
300 dollars,

843
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
something like that.

844
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you buy anything from them,

845
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
then the price comes down.

846
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes.

847
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Now,

848
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
there are a few minor additions,

849
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
but still,

850
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
you can buy

851
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
a little more expensive stuff.

852
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes,

853
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
but also,

854
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I mean,

855
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
if you buy it,

856
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
you will.

857
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yes,

858
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
anyway.

859
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I mean,

860
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I haven't bought a license yet,

861
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
because,

862
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
simply,

863
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
in the paid version,

864
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
there is absolutely nothing,

865
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
that would,

866
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
ruin the movie.

867
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You know,

868
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm not a filmmaker,

869
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
so,

870
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't care about those tools.

871
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
For a YouTuber,

872
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
it's just good enough.

873
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You know.

874
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I don't care.

875
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I came to this,

876
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
not just because of,

877
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
some noise reduction,

878
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
or something like that,

879
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
but,

880
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
the first project,

881
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that was,

882
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
you had to delete something,

883
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
from a phone,

884
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
or something like that.

885
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yes.

886
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And,

887
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
it doesn't allow for that.

888
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And,

889
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
it's just a tool,

890
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that I needed,

891
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and I was like,

892
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
ok,

893
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
at this point,

894
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
it's already the first thing,

895
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
right?

896
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yes.

897
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But, yes,

898
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
definitely,

899
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
everything can be done,

900
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
for free.

901
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're filming,

902
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and you're recording,

903
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
on camera,

904
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
B-RAW.

905
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yes,

906
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
so,

907
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Blackmagic's RAW codec,

908
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
although,

909
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
for those long recordings,

910
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
in,

911
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
let's say,

912
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
the lowest quality,

913
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
because,

914
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
it has some,

915
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
possibility of compression,

916
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
also RAW,

917
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
format,

918
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
because,

919
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
if it's not,

920
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
really RAW,

921
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
in the video,

922
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
then,

923
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
yes,

924
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
actually,

925
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
this is being recorded,

926
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
in RAW.

927
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm recording RAW,

928
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
mostly,

929
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
because,

930
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
because the workflow,

931
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
is completely,

932
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
already,

933
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
working with Davinci,

934
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
right?

935
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Because Davinci,

936
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
for those who don't know,

937
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
is the same company,

938
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Blackmagic Design,

939
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
they work in hardware,

940
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and software,

941
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and,

942
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
this,

943
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
this works together,

944
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
clean,

945
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
clean and smooth.

946
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
A lot of my work,

947
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I have,

948
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
with post-production,

949
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
from which,

950
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I made friends,

951
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
mostly,

952
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
with filesize,

953
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and,

954
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I work in RAW.

955
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Because,

956
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm recording,

957
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm recording a program,

958
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
the program,

959
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
is already set up,

960
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
to work with,

961
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Blackmagic RAW footage,

962
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and,

963
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't need,

964
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
those,

965
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
how to say,

966
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
from flat profile,

967
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I hope you know,

968
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
what I'm talking about,

969
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
from flat profile,

970
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
to,

971
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to non-flat,

972
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
or,

973
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
how to say,

974
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
not,

975
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
not only,

976
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
conversion,

977
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
because,

978
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it's,

979
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
practically,

980
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
everything works,

981
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
one,

982
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
two,

983
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
three.

984
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yes,

985
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
because,

986
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I have to,

987
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
have fun here,

988
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and,

989
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm recording,

990
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
at home,

991
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
my video,

992
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
on Sony,

993
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
this,

994
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
S-Log3,

995
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
logarithmic,

996
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
format,

997
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
so to speak,

998
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and,

999
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
it's,

1000
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
so,

1001
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
so you have,

1002
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
full hitter,

1003
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
overexposed,

1004
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and underexposed,

1005
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
you can,

1006
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
even RAW,

1007
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
because it's,

1008
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
RAW,

1009
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
which is,

1010
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
H264,

1011
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
to be precise,

1012
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and it's,

1013
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
so,

1014
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
overexposed,

1015
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and if it's overexposed,

1016
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
you can't,

1017
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
pull it back,

1018
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
because you lose,

1019
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't know,

1020
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
you know,

1021
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
if you have a light,

1022
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
on your forehead,

1023
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and your forehead,

1024
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
shines a little there,

1025
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and you lose,

1026
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
the data,

1027
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
you know,

1028
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and it's,

1029
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
so,

1030
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
too,

1031
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
too.

1032
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Let's,

1033
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
let's know,

1034
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
what is,

1035
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
overexposed,

1036
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
or underexposed.

1037
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So,

1038
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
if you,

1039
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
when you,

1040
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
set,

1041
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the frame,

1042
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
on your camera,

1043
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it's,

1044
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you can,

1045
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
overexposed means,

1046
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that the light points,

1047
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
are brighter,

1048
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
than those sensors,

1049
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
can,

1050
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't know,

1051
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
tolerate,

1052
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
somehow,

1053
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I would say,

1054
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
it's,

1055
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
overexposed,

1056
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and there,

1057
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
after that,

1058
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
the sensor sees only white.

1059
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But,

1060
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
that means,

1061
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
that,

1062
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
that white is,

1063
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
pure white,

1064
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I mean,

1065
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
pure,

1066
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
real white,

1067
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
there is no important,

1068
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
decorations,

1069
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
inside,

1070
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
what else,

1071
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
can be,

1072
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
but it's,

1073
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
white.

1074
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Finished,

1075
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
right?

1076
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And,

1077
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
under expose,

1078
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
is on the other side,

1079
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I mean,

1080
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
if we have black light,

1081
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and you have the sensor,

1082
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
that is not too sensitive,

1083
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and there is a shadow,

1084
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and then there is black light,

1085
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and sensor doesn't know,

1086
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
what is there,

1087
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and it's not possible,

1088
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to move,

1089
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
then lower.

1090
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And now,

1091
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
when we are photographing,

1092
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
in photos,

1093
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
that data,

1094
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't know,

1095
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
it's huge,

1096
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I can almost see,

1097
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
with black light,

1098
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm photographing,

1099
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and I will always,

1100
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
put it in software,

1101
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and because,

1102
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
16 bit,

1103
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
so much data,

1104
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
can be,

1105
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
on pixel,

1106
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that there will always be,

1107
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
a lot of difference,

1108
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and from that,

1109
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
enough information,

1110
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
to get,

1111
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
details,

1112
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
in post-production.

1113
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
While,

1114
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
when recording,

1115
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
there are those files,

1116
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I mean,

1117
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
when photographing,

1118
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
for example,

1119
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't know,

1120
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
you are photographing JPEG,

1121
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
if we go back,

1122
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
if we stay on photographing,

1123
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
you have JPEG,

1124
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
it's a picture,

1125
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't know,

1126
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
4K, whatever,

1127
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
it doesn't matter,

1128
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
it's 2 megabytes,

1129
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
while RAW,

1130
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
has so much data,

1131
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that it's 100 megabytes,

1132
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
so,

1133
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
it's 50 times bigger picture,

1134
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and video is identical,

1135
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and now,

1136
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
if you are on camera,

1137
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
which is intended primarily,

1138
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I mean,

1139
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
photographic camera,

1140
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
but hybrid,

1141
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
so to speak,

1142
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that's what I mean,

1143
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
if you are photographing,

1144
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I mean,

1145
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
if you are recording,

1146
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
or,

1147
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I want to say,

1148
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
those cameras,

1149
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
are not so intended,

1150
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
in video production,

1151
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
which means,

1152
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
that they don't have,

1153
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
the possibility of RAW,

1154
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
at all,

1155
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean,

1156
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the bit,

1157
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
or as we would say,

1158
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I mean,

1159
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
on frame,

1160
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
or,

1161
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the amount of data,

1162
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
on pixel,

1163
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
is 10 bits,

1164
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
max,

1165
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and you are fully limited,

1166
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
then it's like,

1167
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
it would be JPEG video,

1168
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I mean,

1169
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
again,

1170
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
you don't have some,

1171
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
more detailed details,

1172
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
while RAW,

1173
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
for example,

1174
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
you can,

1175
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
because you have so much,

1176
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
but the files,

1177
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
are so much bigger,

1178
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
because of that,

1179
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
right?

1180
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yes,

1181
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I mean,

1182
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't know,

1183
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
did you understand,

1184
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
what I was talking about?

1185
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes,

1186
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
yes,

1187
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I understand,

1188
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I understand.

1189
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I know,

1190
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that you are recording,

1191
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
slowly,

1192
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
as needed,

1193
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
or,

1194
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I get,

1195
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
those videos,

1196
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
which I can edit,

1197
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I get,

1198
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
from iPhone,

1199
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
recorded,

1200
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and,

1201
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
it's fun,

1202
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
it's a lot of fun.

1203
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Plus,

1204
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it's not RAW.

1205
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
No,

1206
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
it's not RAW.

1207
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We have already tried,

1208
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
recording in those,

1209
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Apple's,

1210
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
let's say,

1211
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you know,

1212
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
who wrote,

1213
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
application,

1214
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
which everyone uses,

1215
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
for recording,

1216
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Apple's app,

1217
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Blackmagic.

1218
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Aha,

1219
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
OK.

1220
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You have a camera,

1221
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Blackmagic camera,

1222
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I think,

1223
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that's how it's called.

1224
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yes,

1225
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
yes,

1226
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
they are the only ones,

1227
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
who use it.

1228
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And that's,

1229
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Apple,

1230
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
in that event,

1231
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
recorded on,

1232
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
iPhone 15,

1233
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
with Blackmagic camera app,

1234
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
in Apple's app.

1235
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I hope,

1236
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
that Tomas and I,

1237
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
won't go too far,

1238
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
in Da Vinci,

1239
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and Blackmagic,

1240
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
so,

1241
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
let's go a little,

1242
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
let's go a little,

1243
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to our,

1244
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
some,

1245
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
some planned projects,

1246
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
because I think,

1247
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
that,

1248
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
we could talk,

1249
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
in Grodno,

1250
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
we could talk,

1251
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
in software,

1252
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
in photography,

1253
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
in everything,

1254
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and,

1255
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
now Tomas,

1256
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Tomas is already,

1257
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the second day here,

1258
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
or are you the third?

1259
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Second.

1260
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Second,

1261
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
right?

1262
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yes,

1263
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm the first guest.

1264
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So maybe,

1265
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
what projects,

1266
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
are,

1267
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
in your field,

1268
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
if you just said,

1269
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that your field,

1270
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
is really,

1271
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
very wide,

1272
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
or more like,

1273
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
without names,

1274
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
so,

1275
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
you make graphics,

1276
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
you make pages,

1277
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
you make,

1278
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
let's say,

1279
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
a plug,

1280
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
a plug,

1281
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
a plug,

1282
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
for a project.

1283
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Projects are,

1284
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
what to start with,

1285
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
some,

1286
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I mean,

1287
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
most of the projects,

1288
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
are those,

1289
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
because,

1290
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
let's say,

1291
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
what I wanted to do before,

1292
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
video,

1293
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
illustration,

1294
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that is inside of that,

1295
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
then,

1296
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
fixed,

1297
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
then,

1298
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the tasks are done.

1299
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Okay.

1300
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The main project,

1301
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
in which I am,

1302
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
outside of,

1303
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
tech,

1304
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I mean,

1305
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
outside of that,

1306
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
is more about,

1307
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
creativity,

1308
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
from a human point of view,

1309
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and,

1310
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and,

1311
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
some growth,

1312
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and that creativity,

1313
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
in young people,

1314
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
in old people,

1315
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and,

1316
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and there,

1317
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
then we work,

1318
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and,

1319
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
materials for,

1320
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
for,

1321
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
for,

1322
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
networking,

1323
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
video,

1324
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
editing,

1325
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
making shorts for,

1326
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Pinterest,

1327
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
YouTube,

1328
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Instagram,

1329
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
then another,

1330
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
another project.

1331
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But you don't have,

1332
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
you don't have for,

1333
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
video,

1334
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
things.

1335
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Look,

1336
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I mean,

1337
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
those videos are,

1338
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I shoot them,

1339
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and then I try,

1340
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
somehow,

1341
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
from those,

1342
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
when they are,

1343
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
very,

1344
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
improvised,

1345
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but,

1346
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
co-founder,

1347
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
he has,

1348
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
in that area,

1349
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
he is very powerful,

1350
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and,

1351
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
when he starts to explain,

1352
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
he can,

1353
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
talk about anything,

1354
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
for a long time,

1355
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and then,

1356
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the problem of that,

1357
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
retention,

1358
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
editing,

1359
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
that you can,

1360
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
try to cut it as much as possible,

1361
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and maybe cut a lot of things.

1362
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So,

1363
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
that's one project.

1364
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
With the other,

1365
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I then,

1366
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
actually,

1367
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
in,

1368
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
in one start-up,

1369
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I greeted,

1370
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
there it's the same,

1371
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
first,

1372
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
you need,

1373
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
then,

1374
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
on the logo,

1375
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
split page,

1376
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
illustrations,

1377
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and then,

1378
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
those illustrations,

1379
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
are great,

1380
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and you can send them,

1381
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
then,

1382
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to all slides,

1383
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
to all other materials,

1384
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and then,

1385
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
in the end,

1386
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
we decided,

1387
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that,

1388
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
actually,

1389
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I also work,

1390
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
only product,

1391
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
which is called,

1392
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
back-end,

1393
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
dashboard,

1394
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
for,

1395
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
for what they do.

1396
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Ok.

1397
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It started,

1398
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
purely,

1399
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
yeah,

1400
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
we make logo,

1401
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
that's it.

1402
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Was it also,

1403
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
like,

1404
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I have similar experience,

1405
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
so,

1406
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
sometimes,

1407
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
we had that,

1408
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you know,

1409
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
someone from,

1410
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
some business school,

1411
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
or business school,

1412
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
or whatever,

1413
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
they came to you,

1414
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and then,

1415
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
like,

1416
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
hey,

1417
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I have a great business idea,

1418
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
but,

1419
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
actually,

1420
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't have to pay you,

1421
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
to be,

1422
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
you know,

1423
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
co-founder,

1424
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
or something like that.

1425
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Did it come from that,

1426
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
or?

1427
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
No,

1428
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
it was purely,

1429
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
paid,

1430
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
paid for work.

1431
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Ah,

1432
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
yeah,

1433
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
yeah,

1434
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
but,

1435
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
it's a,

1436
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
between these,

1437
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
projects.

1438
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And,

1439
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I also have one more project,

1440
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
that is,

1441
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
is actually,

1442
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
it's quite,

1443
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
which connects,

1444
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We'll know each other,

1445
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the business,

1446
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the design,

1447
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and the business.

1448
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They called it,

1449
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
D&B,

1450
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
which is,

1451
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
local,

1452
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Slovenia,

1453
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and it tries,

1454
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to connect,

1455
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
designer,

1456
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
with business world.

1457
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
There,

1458
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
more than not,

1459
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
like I said earlier,

1460
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
a Pasteur brand,

1461
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you know,

1462
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
all materials are,

1463
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
on-brand,

1464
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
whatever needs to be prepared,

1465
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
goes through me,

1466
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
either I prepare it,

1467
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
or someone else,

1468
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
prepares it quickly,

1469
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and I'm like,

1470
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
OK,

1471
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll burn it,

1472
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
so that it's done,

1473
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and it always,

1474
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
has to be like that.

1475
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Now,

1476
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
maybe,

1477
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
in response,

1478
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
considering that,

1479
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
there was a previous episode,

1480
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
actually,

1481
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
for Gon,

1482
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
where they talked a little more,

1483
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
in tears,

1484
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and about business.

1485
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That's all,

1486
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
actually,

1487
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
freelance,

1488
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
so,

1489
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
you don't have,

1490
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
or,

1491
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
do you have,

1492
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
part-time jobs,

1493
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
like,

1494
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
some jobs,

1495
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
or?

1496
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
No,

1497
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
those are all freelance,

1498
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
freelance projects,

1499
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
yes.

1500
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
OK.

1501
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Now,

1502
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'll tell you about a project,

1503
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
that you saw,

1504
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
that fascinated me so much,

1505
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and you mentioned it before,

1506
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and,

1507
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
so,

1508
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Jan comes,

1509
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
or,

1510
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
he sends a message,

1511
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Hey Tomas,

1512
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
we're across the sea,

1513
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
come on,

1514
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
let's go for a coffee,

1515
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
or a drink,

1516
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
or whatever,

1517
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and I'm like,

1518
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
yeah,

1519
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
cool,

1520
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
where are you?

1521
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And he's like,

1522
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
what?

1523
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yeah,

1524
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Disc Golf,

1525
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
what?

1526
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But now tell,

1527
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
now tell,

1528
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
please,

1529
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to the listeners,

1530
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
because,

1531
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
because,

1532
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm not the only one,

1533
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
who saw it for the first time,

1534
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
so,

1535
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
tell us,

1536
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
what is Disc Golf,

1537
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
please.

1538
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's something you have to do,

1539
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
yes,

1540
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
for Disc Golf,

1541
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but you're doing it again.

1542
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yeah,

1543
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
again,

1544
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
so,

1545
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
to get into the subject of this episode,

1546
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
now,

1547
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm relatively

1548
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
on a full break,

1549
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
or,

1550
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I wouldn't like to be on a break,

1551
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
but,

1552
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
sometimes,

1553
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Disc Golf,

1554
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
tournaments,

1555
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and everything,

1556
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
during my work,

1557
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
so,

1558
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
give me,

1559
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
give me one,

1560
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
very,

1561
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
very short,

1562
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
what is,

1563
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
what is Disc Golf?

1564
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's a sport,

1565
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
very similar to golf,

1566
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
where,

1567
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
instead of,

1568
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
fingers and thumbs,

1569
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
you use discs,

1570
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and you aim,

1571
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
or frisbees,

1572
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
or frisbees,

1573
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
yes,

1574
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and you try to catch them,

1575
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and shoot them,

1576
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to the basket,

1577
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
in which,

1578
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
you can score,

1579
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and that's it.

1580
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It sounds,

1581
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
very simple,

1582
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
but,

1583
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
when you try,

1584
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
you see,

1585
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
it's not.

1586
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Now,

1587
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
very,

1588
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I mean,

1589
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm sorry,

1590
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
but we both fell,

1591
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
now,

1592
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
into Disc Golf,

1593
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but,

1594
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
what is,

1595
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
what is,

1596
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
what is,

1597
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
what is,

1598
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
what is,

1599
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
what is,

1600
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
what is,

1601
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
what is,

1602
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
what is,

1603
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
what is,

1604
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
what is,

1605
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
what is,

1606
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
what is,

1607
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
what is,

1608
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
what is,

1609
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
what is,

1610
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
what is,

1611
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
what is,

1612
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
what is,

1613
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
what is,

1614
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
what is,

1615
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
what is,

1616
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
what is,

1617
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
what is,

1618
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
what is,

1619
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
what is,

1620
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
what is,

1621
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
what is,

1622
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
what is,

1623
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
what is,

1624
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
what is guess worth?

1625
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
No,

1626
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it's certainly not game,

1627
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
what is,

1628
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
what is,

1629
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
what is,

1630
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
what is,

1631
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
what is,

1632
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
what is,

1633
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
what is,

1634
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
what is,

1635
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
what is,

1636
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
what is,

1637
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
what is,

1638
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
what is,

1639
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
what is,

1640
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
what is,

1641
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
what is,

1642
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
what is,

1643
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
what is,

1644
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
what is,

1645
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
what is,

1646
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
what is,

1647
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
what is,

1648
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
what is,

1649
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
what is,

1650
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
what is,

1651
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
what is,

1652
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
what is,

1653
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
what is,

1654
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
what is,

1655
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
what is,

1656
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
what is,

1657
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
what is,

1658
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
what is,

1659
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
what is,

1660
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
what is.

1661
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What can one do?

1662
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Well,

1663
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I would say that

1664
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
there are many

1665
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
technical problems

1666
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
that you can fall into

1667
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and you get lost

1668
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
because each

1669
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
disk can be

1670
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
in four different

1671
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
layers

1672
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
that relate

1673
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
differently.

1674
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The wind is ideal,

1675
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the altitude

1676
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
is ideal,

1677
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and the shape

1678
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
of the disk

1679
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
is ideal,

1680
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
how you drive,

1681
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
how your

1682
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
engine is

1683
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
ideal,

1684
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and then

1685
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
at the end

1686
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
there is

1687
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
such a problem

1688
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
that is

1689
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
different,

1690
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
but not

1691
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
different.

1692
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And this

1693
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
9 skillset

1694
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
disgolfing

1695
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
is very

1696
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
far from

1697
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
tech skills

1698
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and everything

1699
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
related,

1700
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
for example.

1701
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So,

1702
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
maybe

1703
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
a little

1704
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
explanation

1705
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
of this

1706
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
is that

1707
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
when I listen

1708
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
to how

1709
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
my field

1710
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
sees

1711
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
this rule,

1712
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I am

1713
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
sometimes

1714
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
in this

1715
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
field

1716
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
totally

1717
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
unknown

1718
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and unskilled.

1719
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The most

1720
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I know

1721
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
how to

1722
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
put it,

1723
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
this is

1724
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
the highlight

1725
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
of my

1726
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
tech skill.

1727
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So,

1728
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
maybe

1729
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
somehow

1730
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
in reverse,

1731
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
so,

1732
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I

1733
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
for myself

1734
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
think that

1735
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
everything I

1736
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
start,

1737
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that I don't

1738
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
lack

1739
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
some

1740
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
programming

1741
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
knowledge.

1742
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't

1743
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
mean that

1744
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't see

1745
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
options and

1746
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
possibilities

1747
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
that would

1748
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
suit me,

1749
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
but I

1750
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
do see

1751
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
that

1752
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
so,

1753
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
that

1754
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
it's

1755
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
right

1756
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
if you have

1757
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
both tech

1758
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
knowledge and

1759
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
maybe creative

1760
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
knowledge.

1761
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
How much

1762
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
is this

1763
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
width

1764
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
useful

1765
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
if we

1766
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
compare?

1767
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yes.

1768
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
For me,

1769
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
personally,

1770
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
at the beginning,

1771
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I am,

1772
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
for example,

1773
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
a little

1774
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
against what

1775
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Tomas said,

1776
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
he started

1777
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
in web design

1778
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and then

1779
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
at the beginning

1780
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
he wanted to

1781
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
be a programmer,

1782
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
so,

1783
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
of course,

1784
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
my brain wanted

1785
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
to work a little

1786
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
differently,

1787
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and I went

1788
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
into design,

1789
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
but I also

1790
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
worked a lot

1791
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
in web design,

1792
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
HTML,

1793
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
CSS,

1794
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and at the

1795
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
same time

1796
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
when CSS

1797
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
appeared,

1798
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I fell

1799
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
in and

1800
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
it was

1801
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
funny.

1802
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And there

1803
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
was Internet

1804
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Explorer 6.

1805
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Internet Explorer

1806
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
6,

1807
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
yes,

1808
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and I

1809
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
gradually

1810
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
went out

1811
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
of it,

1812
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
that I also

1813
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
worked in

1814
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
the front-end

1815
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
part of the

1816
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
design,

1817
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think

1818
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
it helped

1819
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
me a lot

1820
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
in the design

1821
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
itself.

1822
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I think

1823
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
we always

1824
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
changed

1825
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
a lot easier

1826
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
for developers,

1827
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and maybe

1828
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I prepared

1829
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
some tasks

1830
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
beforehand

1831
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
when I

1832
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
knew that

1833
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
they could

1834
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
be done,

1835
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that I

1836
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
wasn't

1837
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
afraid

1838
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
of

1839
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
doing

1840
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
them.

1841
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So,

1842
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I think

1843
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
it helped

1844
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
me a lot

1845
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
in the design

1846
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
part.

1847
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And

1848
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
especially

1849
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
in the

1850
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
communication

1851
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
part.

1852
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yes,

1853
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
if you know

1854
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
what's

1855
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
waiting for

1856
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
you,

1857
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I understand

1858
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
that.

1859
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Now,

1860
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I don't

1861
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
know,

1862
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
you went

1863
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
a little

1864
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
more into

1865
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
hardware

1866
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
design,

1867
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
but

1868
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm

1869
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
curious

1870
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
about

1871
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
how

1872
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
you,

1873
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't

1874
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
know,

1875
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
your printer

1876
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
and router,

1877
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and everything

1878
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
in general,

1879
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
where do

1880
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
you work

1881
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the most?

1882
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Because

1883
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
you work

1884
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
creatively

1885
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and

1886
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
technically,

1887
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but

1888
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
what are

1889
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
those

1890
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
skills?

1891
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Look,

1892
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I'll put it

1893
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
this way,

1894
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
regarding

1895
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
design,

1896
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I have

1897
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
a lot

1898
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
of

1899
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
basic

1900
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
shapes,

1901
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but

1902
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
there,

1903
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I had

1904
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
those

1905
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
purely

1906
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
from scratch

1907
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
design

1908
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
products.

1909
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So,

1910
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
purely

1911
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
manual

1912
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
skills.

1913
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So,

1914
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I have

1915
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
a lot

1916
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
of

1917
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
basic

1918
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
shapes,

1919
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
but

1920
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I have

1921
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
a lot

1922
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
of

1923
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
mechanical

1924
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
skills,

1925
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
electrical

1926
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
skills,

1927
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
electronic

1928
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
limitations

1929
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and

1930
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
regulations,

1931
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and

1932
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I don't

1933
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
know,

1934
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
how the

1935
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
matrix

1936
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
works,

1937
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
so you

1938
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
get to

1939
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
know the

1940
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
basics of

1941
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
how the

1942
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
printer works

1943
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
but

1944
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
the rest

1945
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
is relatively

1946
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
fine.

1947
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And

1948
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
everything,

1949
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
for example,

1950
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
how I

1951
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
print connections,

1952
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
so it

1953
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
is

1954
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
very

1955
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
simple.

1956
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And

1957
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I

1958
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
have

1959
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
a lot

1960
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
of

1961
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
mechanical

1962
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
skills,

1963
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
so

1964
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I

1965
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
have

1966
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
a lot

1967
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
of

1968
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
mechanical

1969
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
limitations

1970
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and

1971
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
regulations

1972
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
so

1973
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
it

1974
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
is

1975
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
relatively

1976
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
fine.

1977
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And

1978
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
the

1979
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
rest

1980
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
is

1981
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
relatively

1982
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Usually, most of the time, not in the buildings we have in the mansion, but

1983
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
yes, it is for protection and for you and for the layers below, for bakers.

1984
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But I want to say something else, I wanted the layer to be visible,

1985
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
that if someone would like to learn again, if I return to my desire to sell knowledge,

1986
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:28,000
that they can take the connection from my printer and look at the traces.

1987
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Slobo will give you a brief overview of this, I know that we will open source it completely,

1988
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
the whole printer, so if anyone wants to look, they will have step files, they will have gerbers,

1989
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
these are all files, if you want to make a part yourself, you send it to someone who knows how to make a printed version.

1990
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So you give all the information, but what about the printer?

1991
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
How does someone come to your printer?

1992
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yes, they come to my printer at monominuskeyboards.com,

1993
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
they can buy it, I sell them, but I will say that this project,

1994
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I don't have it as a commercial failure, I still sell them and sell them,

1995
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
but not enough to be presented as a basic source of income.

1996
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So from a commercial point of view, from an artistic point of view,

1997
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I would say that this is a very successful project, because I liked it the whole time,

1998
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
everything I learned and everything I am now applying to the development of the router,

1999
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
when I started working on it, but it is not the same now,

2000
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
to be able to develop a company, so to speak.

2001
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
So far, I haven't even reached zero, for example, with the printer,

2002
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
but look, no regrets, thank God.

2003
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Yes, you gave it your all, it gave you back what it gave you.

2004
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That's right, a lot of knowledge, for example, so now that I work on a router,

2005
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
things are flying differently, so I don't repeat those mistakes,

2006
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
and I'm not afraid that the same thing will happen.

2007
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And here, I think that the same difficulties have arisen,

2008
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
here I also managed to get some risky capital,

2009
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,000
so the company was established in Delaware from March last month,

2010
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
so from March 2024, and we already got, here I am today,

2011
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
the first offers are coming for foreign investors,

2012
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
so now we will be flying more seriously,

2013
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and here I really got all the knowledge I needed to finish it.

2014
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Even if we go back a bit, you probably can do a bit more here,

2015
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I mean, you are not from scratch, you can design everything.

2016
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Are you talking about the router?

2017
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yes.

2018
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No, again from scratch.

2019
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Yes, you can look, for example, I mean, yes, from scratch,

2020
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I mean, I don't have to make the processor myself,

2021
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I don't have the knowledge, I don't have the skills, I don't have the money,

2022
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
but you can look, for example, at the market,

2023
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I mean, it's called embedded,

2024
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
because embedded means that the processor itself is part of the connection,

2025
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
because in conventional computers, the processor is special,

2026
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
when you plug it into the connection, for example,

2027
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and embedded, the routers are embedded,

2028
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
or the phones, or the ones that burn everything,

2029
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
so it's like gold or gold or whatever.

2030
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It's really hard for me when you don't speak Slovenian,

2031
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
because usually you burn soldered, or soldered,

2032
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
the third American, and then you say gold,

2033
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
so it sounds weird, I don't know why.

2034
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It's also for a lot of people.

2035
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes, yes, that's how it is.

2036
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Anyway, and here again, you can look,

2037
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
where are those who sell processors

2038
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
in terms of network capacity,

2039
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
because the router is a network device,

2040
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and you know which processors are more

2041
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
a network protocol, or used in network devices.

2042
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Okay, I understand that,

2043
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
but you look for the most optimal,

2044
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
what suits you best for the need.

2045
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yes.

2046
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Now, but in my opinion,

2047
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I always look at the fact that I'm preparing

2048
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
your YouTube late.

2049
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Thank you.

2050
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I'm trying harder, but I'm not that much on YouTube.

2051
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And also the printers, right?

2052
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It seems to me that you are more

2053
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
aiming for aesthetics.

2054
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yes, this is very important to me.

2055
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
This is why, I will say,

2056
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
of all my visual hobbies,

2057
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
it is very important to me.

2058
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
You see, it's the same as the printing box.

2059
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yes, you know, that's why I'm a big fan,

2060
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
as I said before,

2061
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
that they send it to Apple.

2062
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That's why I like Apple so much.

2063
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Okay, fanboy is perhaps too powerful a word,

2064
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
but I really have their iPads, iPhones,

2065
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
wife's iPhone, child's iPhone,

2066
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
at iMac, not at iMac,

2067
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
at MacStudio, I work,

2068
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm really into their system,

2069
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
because, first of all, they really work.

2070
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You know, at the time there was still that fame,

2071
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
you buy an Apple laptop or MacBook,

2072
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and everyone, oh, it's so expensive,

2073
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
but today, if you look at, I don't know,

2074
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
an average MacBook, or an average Dell,

2075
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
or Samsung, or Asus, or whatever,

2076
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
it's all the same.

2077
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
You're on the same level.

2078
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's not like, oh, Apple is much more expensive.

2079
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's not like that.

2080
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Yes, you can always compare it

2081
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
with a Windows laptop for Yuri,

2082
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
but you wouldn't compare it

2083
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
with an apple or a pear.

2084
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But what I want to say is that

2085
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Apple is still, you know,

2086
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I can bring something,

2087
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I want to clean it up,

2088
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and I put it back on the table.

2089
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It's very simple.

2090
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But if I open a terminal,

2091
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
you can still, I don't know,

2092
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
compare it with a Unix system

2093
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
from the bottom, and you can

2094
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
come to all the files,

2095
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
you can do whatever you want,

2096
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
and you only have a terminal,

2097
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
practically, without any

2098
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
graphic tool.

2099
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It's aesthetically perfect,

2100
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and that's the layer that

2101
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
combines those things,

2102
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
so that the thing looks good,

2103
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and if you need it, it's really powerful,

2104
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and it's really like that.

2105
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But the whole experience

2106
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
is top-notch.

2107
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I experienced that, for example,

2108
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
when we were still parking,

2109
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
when we hired Mitya Mousari,

2110
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
he was at the time,

2111
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I think he's still with us,

2112
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
but I don't think he's so active anymore,

2113
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
he was a user and an expert.

2114
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Wait, my mic is down,

2115
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
let me put it back.

2116
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Technical difficulties.

2117
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yes, technical difficulties.

2118
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Anyway, Mitya hired

2119
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
a couple of people,

2120
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
they were in front of me,

2121
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
so we developed a product,

2122
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
they used our product,

2123
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and he was the first person

2124
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
who came in and used our application,

2125
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
he got a script, a fake script,

2126
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
you can feel that.

2127
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And you saw a person,

2128
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and you saw how he had no idea,

2129
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and you thought,

2130
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
what's wrong with you?

2131
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And then he somehow clicked to his goal,

2132
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and you thanked him, and he left.

2133
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And another person came in,

2134
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and he struggled again, and so on.

2135
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And with everyone else,

2136
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
you realized that nothing was wrong with them,

2137
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
that something is wrong with you,

2138
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
because you got used to things.

2139
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
That's why I say that I really liked

2140
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
the evangelist UX over the years,

2141
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
that it really means a lot to me,

2142
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and now about routers,

2143
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
we also have a team

2144
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that specializes exclusively in industrial design,

2145
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and that's the team CITO Design,

2146
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
shout out, here in Ljubljana,

2147
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and they will help me,

2148
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
they are really...

2149
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
we had a lot of meetings,

2150
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
even, I don't know, a simple thing,

2151
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
for example, a beam on a router.

2152
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We had a meeting about a beam,

2153
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
or a beam.

2154
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
What color was it?

2155
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That's a legitimate question,

2156
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
because, for example,

2157
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
look at yourself at home,

2158
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
how many times do you look at a router?

2159
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Many times.

2160
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
But at the beginning,

2161
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
never.

2162
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
How many beams does it have?

2163
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
How many of them are there,

2164
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
because you never look at them?

2165
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And that's purely practical,

2166
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
but also cost-effective.

2167
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Now imagine,

2168
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
you have a beam that costs 5 cents,

2169
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
but now you have 5 beams,

2170
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm talking about diodes,

2171
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
but now you have 5 diodes on top,

2172
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
and now you make 100,000 routers,

2173
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm imagining,

2174
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and RedZap,

2175
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and in the end,

2176
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
cost-effectiveness,

2177
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
visually, everything,

2178
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and you see,

2179
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I don't have to say anything.

2180
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It's worth it.

2181
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I was wondering

2182
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
if I should add a little to my work.

2183
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Now I have one more question for him,

2184
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
about connections.

2185
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You're in one area,

2186
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
but you go to another,

2187
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
how much does it benefit you?

2188
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
How did you get this knowledge?

2189
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
You weren't in hardware from the start,

2190
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
so you didn't know.

2191
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
What can you do

2192
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
so that this knowledge doesn't limit you

2193
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in terms of what you can do,

2194
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
for example, against coins,

2195
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
or did you go for a bluff inside

2196
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and then against it?

2197
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Jan will answer that.

2198
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
No, no, no, no.

2199
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Aha.

2200
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Our condition.

2201
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I mean,

2202
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
yes,

2203
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
it's very informative,

2204
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and you can focus

2205
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
very strongly

2206
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
on hours of googling

2207
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
about a topic that will interest you for two days,

2208
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
and then maybe nothing more.

2209
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I think that's

2210
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
the best description for

2211
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
the problem.

2212
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
No, I mean,

2213
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
that's how our brain works.

2214
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
You get stuck in something,

2215
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and it just interests you.

2216
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
If it interests you, for example...

2217
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You have to know everything,

2218
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
not just a little.

2219
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You can't stop.

2220
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
You don't know how to help yourself to stop.

2221
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
One woman came to me,

2222
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Tomaš shook her,

2223
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and then she turned blue.

2224
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I have to google this to the end.

2225
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It goes to extremes,

2226
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
but on the other hand,

2227
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
if I'm not interested,

2228
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I can procrastinate for a month.

2229
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
She sent me,

2230
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
and it already happened to me,

2231
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and I'm not ashamed.

2232
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
For example,

2233
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
you get a bill to pay,

2234
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
but it's a convoluted way

2235
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
of paying.

2236
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Based on a true story.

2237
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
If I didn't want to pay

2238
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
on that bill,

2239
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
which was never a problem

2240
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
in finance,

2241
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I could pay it somewhere,

2242
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
but it wasn't enough

2243
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
to pay it at home.

2244
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It was such a pain to get stuck,

2245
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
so much pain,

2246
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
that I had to go to the court,

2247
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and they took my cash,

2248
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and I had to pay the court,

2249
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and in the end it cost me 80 euros,

2250
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
instead of the original 20.

2251
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I think it's called ADHD tax.

2252
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I think it's called that.

2253
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You just can't do it.

2254
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You can't talk about it.

2255
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And then you have to do it on YouTube.

2256
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yes, but on YouTube,

2257
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
it's a lot of work.

2258
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It's a lot of work.

2259
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Especially in the late hours.

2260
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You have an idea,

2261
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and then you have a deep dive,

2262
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
and then you start doing it.

2263
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It's a lot of work.

2264
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
You go into a rabbit hole,

2265
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and then you see

2266
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
what you're going to get.

2267
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
But you always have something left.

2268
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Something left, yes.

2269
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's not easy,

2270
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
because you have a wide range of things

2271
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
that you can use

2272
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
later on.

2273
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Let's say, Jan,

2274
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'll give you a programming challenge,

2275
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
or maybe this is it,

2276
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
something is growing,

2277
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
and you'll be like,

2278
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
we'll get it in three years.

2279
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I was thinking

2280
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
about a specific language,

2281
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
or just a concept.

2282
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I think it's a great idea.

2283
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I don't care about that.

2284
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I don't care about the name,

2285
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
or anything like that.

2286
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I don't care.

2287
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I think it could be

2288
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
a program.

2289
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't want to be too loud,

2290
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
but maybe you can give me

2291
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
something easy.

2292
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Really.

2293
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Thank you so much

2294
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that I know how to google.

2295
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Because I think

2296
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
it's not...

2297
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Jan, I'll give you a challenge.

2298
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Modern programmers

2299
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
are like

2300
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Fax.

2301
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I would learn Fax.

2302
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
We all learned

2303
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Stack Overflow,

2304
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I learned PHP,

2305
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
it was linda.com.

2306
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Linda is a big name.

2307
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I pirated half of Linda.

2308
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That was a year ago.

2309
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And in my defense,

2310
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
dear Linda and viewers,

2311
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I was full-led.

2312
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I didn't use them

2313
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
because I brought notes.

2314
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
But that's how I learned

2315
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
to program.

2316
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm a mechanical engineer,

2317
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and a failed forestry engineer.

2318
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Great.

2319
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I think the only problem

2320
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
is that I didn't have enough time

2321
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
to edit the short video

2322
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
in Grodno or some other video project.

2323
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Programming is a very

2324
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
long thing

2325
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
because

2326
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I see hours and hours

2327
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
that I need.

2328
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Maybe it's too much,

2329
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
but I think the beginning

2330
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
is a bit too much.

2331
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You need to find something

2332
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
to connect with what you're doing.

2333
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You had the same project

2334
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
with the pictures.

2335
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Do you do something like that?

2336
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Or do you just solve everything?

2337
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It all depends on the problem.

2338
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
You need to add something

2339
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
in the program

2340
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
that's not in the user interface.

2341
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Then I google different codes

2342
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
and commands.

2343
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You need to go that far

2344
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
to find a solution

2345
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
to make it more programmable.

2346
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
But to know

2347
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
where to start,

2348
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I don't know.

2349
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I wouldn't know how to start

2350
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
such a project.

2351
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
People are getting closer

2352
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
to learn how to start.

2353
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I think you always

2354
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
have to start from the problem.

2355
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The one I don't have.

2356
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That's my problem.

2357
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The problem you don't have.

2358
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
If you have a task

2359
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and you listen to it...

2360
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
No, it won't be OK.

2361
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You don't need someone else.

2362
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I know what you mean.

2363
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
We can give ideas.

2364
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
We can give ideas.

2365
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Where are the ideas?

2366
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
We'll find an idea

2367
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
to learn how to program in Ruby.

2368
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I have an idea.

2369
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I have an idea.

2370
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The first google is

2371
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
What is Ruby?

2372
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm very interested

2373
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I was born in Zraven,

2374
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
which is one of the places

2375
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
where I was introduced to Oto.

2376
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
We didn't have a camera yet.

2377
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
But I see

2378
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
how outside of this field

2379
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm still

2380
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
on the other side

2381
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
of technology.

2382
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It would be

2383
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
a segway

2384
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
to some AI talks.

2385
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I think

2386
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
there's a bit too much AI

2387
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
with this.

2388
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
For all of us.

2389
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
AI as

2390
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
a tool

2391
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
would probably help me

2392
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
with such tasks

2393
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and such problems.

2394
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
For example,

2395
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
the animation of the logo

2396
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
that happened at the beginning.

2397
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
At the intro in the garden.

2398
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
We wrote a script

2399
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
in After Effects

2400
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
which is 4300

2401
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
squares

2402
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
that were put on a piece of paper

2403
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and changed into

2404
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
a slow pixel animation

2405
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
to look nice

2406
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
on the surface.

2407
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And then they die.

2408
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You didn't mention

2409
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
how many versions

2410
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
you gave me

2411
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
to mount on my hands.

2412
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
We came to the point

2413
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
where we could help you.

2414
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
We had an idea.

2415
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I think we used

2416
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
the whole first episode

2417
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
of this season.

2418
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
We didn't find

2419
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
my part.

2420
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I really liked your

2421
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
squares and all that.

2422
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Let's talk

2423
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
about AI.

2424
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Many people ask me

2425
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
as a photographer

2426
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
if I'm afraid that AI

2427
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
will replace me.

2428
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Because it's full of

2429
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
generative stuff.

2430
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Everyone looks at my work

2431
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
because I do more events

2432
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and more in-person stuff.

2433
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I think that

2434
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I won't be replaced so soon.

2435
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Or if I'm a bit worried

2436
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
that we're all in the Balkans

2437
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
a bit behind.

2438
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm still a bit behind.

2439
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
What would you say?

2440
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Do you see a threat

2441
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
of AI?

2442
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
An opportunity?

2443
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
What do you think?

2444
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Are we going to generate

2445
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
rewards instead of taking pictures?

2446
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
No. I don't have much experience

2447
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
with AI.

2448
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't have much to say

2449
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
about it.

2450
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I treat it as a tool

2451
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and I don't need it

2452
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
anywhere.

2453
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I don't even

2454
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
proofread it.

2455
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I don't proofread

2456
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
my YouTube videos.

2457
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I don't.

2458
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
That's who I am.

2459
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
That's the whole point.

2460
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
That's who I am.

2461
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
If it's AI, it will be AI.

2462
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And

2463
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I take everything

2464
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
out of AI.

2465
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
What do I want to say?

2466
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's a threat.

2467
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It's generic.

2468
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
There are influencers on Instagram

2469
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
who are already AI.

2470
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But they don't change anything.

2471
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Why? Because they're generic.

2472
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You look at 5% of influencers

2473
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and they're the same.

2474
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It's a repetition.

2475
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
It's like robots.

2476
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Why are robots in factories?

2477
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Because they're repetitive

2478
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
shit.

2479
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
We take shit from people

2480
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and I think they can

2481
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
enable creativity

2482
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
so that more people find out

2483
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
that they want to outsource creativity.

2484
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
That's what I think.

2485
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
What?

2486
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I think

2487
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
that

2488
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
there's a panic

2489
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
because AI will

2490
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
replace everything

2491
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
visually.

2492
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I think we're in

2493
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
that bubble.

2494
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
But if you see

2495
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
those debates...

2496
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But if creatives change

2497
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
how will it change?

2498
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Everyone is trying

2499
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and generating something nice.

2500
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Everything is nice, everything is fast.

2501
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I think that

2502
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
creativity is overrated

2503
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
by the whole population.

2504
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So,

2505
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I like to hear

2506
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
that one day

2507
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
instead of watching Netflix

2508
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
they'll generate a series.

2509
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
My idea

2510
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
of what I'd like to watch

2511
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
is good enough

2512
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
to watch Netflix.

2513
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
If you know what I mean.

2514
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Because sometimes you know how to write good scripts

2515
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
and you have an interesting plot.

2516
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That's logical.

2517
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I agree.

2518
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
People think

2519
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
that they'll keep

2520
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
a never-ending cycle.

2521
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
A cycle.

2522
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I don't know.

2523
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Maybe you're...

2524
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I think that your field

2525
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
in terms of illustrations

2526
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
has grown a lot.

2527
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yes, yes.

2528
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It's just

2529
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
because of some copyrights

2530
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and some agreement

2531
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
they reached.

2532
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It's always interesting.

2533
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Every week

2534
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
there's a new existing

2535
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
software with its

2536
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
AI prompting

2537
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
integration.

2538
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And the first question is

2539
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
where did you get the data

2540
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
from?

2541
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And then there's a comment

2542
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
that it looks really good.

2543
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Thank you for the comment.

2544
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
It's a little...

2545
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It's a little...

2546
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It's a little sus.

2547
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Yes, because of that

2548
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and with the power of Adobe

2549
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
you have the AI

2550
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
inside and you can prompt.

2551
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I think that on the one hand

2552
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
you look at it yourself

2553
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
and you're like

2554
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
as an illustrator,

2555
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
as a designer

2556
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
you're going to do something,

2557
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
you're not going to prompt

2558
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
even if it's just for a generation

2559
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
of ideas.

2560
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I think that sometimes

2561
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
you can't do anything

2562
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
out of them.

2563
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
As far as I know,

2564
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I've been doing this for a long time

2565
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and I think I'd lose too much time

2566
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
if I were to teach

2567
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
or explain what exactly I want

2568
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
because I know exactly

2569
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
what I want, what it looks like.

2570
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I've tried with the videos

2571
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
that in English

2572
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
you have more options

2573
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
to make content

2574
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
from other content,

2575
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
the final content.

2576
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It looks better if I find

2577
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
a generated graphic

2578
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
that I need,

2579
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
what kind of text

2580
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
to start with, even if it's

2581
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
going to look better in a year or a month.

2582
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
It all looks cheap.

2583
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I would say

2584
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
now it's like

2585
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
in five years

2586
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I'll know everything.

2587
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
But the problem

2588
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
can't be solved.

2589
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
If you have a creative vision

2590
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
you can't look

2591
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
into the brain.

2592
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Look, AI is

2593
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
a mix.

2594
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's always a mix of what you learn.

2595
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
A person can have a creative idea

2596
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
originally

2597
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
that AI will never have.

2598
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
In my opinion, no.

2599
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And here

2600
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
we're always one step ahead.

2601
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
A very optimistic discussion

2602
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
about AI.

2603
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
You know what I'll tell you?

2604
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
When you look at our sphere

2605
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
we all think

2606
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
that we're in

2607
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
these waters.

2608
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
You don't have to work

2609
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
as hard as you can,

2610
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
but there are

2611
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
90-100 people asking

2612
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
what you think about AI.

2613
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
90% of people

2614
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
won't know

2615
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
what you're talking about.

2616
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I don't think

2617
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
it's as easy as it seems.

2618
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
That's what you said,

2619
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
creativity.

2620
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I see a lot of creativity

2621
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
being outsourced

2622
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
to big corporations.

2623
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I think it's sad

2624
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
for humanity.

2625
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
On the one hand,

2626
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
why would the process

2627
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
of creating

2628
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
art

2629
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
be built

2630
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
when you're creating an idea,

2631
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
when you're drawing something,

2632
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
when you fall into a flow

2633
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
and an idea comes out.

2634
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Why would it be built

2635
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
with a stake?

2636
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And that's it.

2637
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
It's like a sheet

2638
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
without feeling,

2639
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
of growth.

2640
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You're making a picture

2641
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
where you can

2642
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
capture your feelings

2643
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and thoughts.

2644
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I think it's

2645
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
from a legal point of view

2646
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
that it's possible

2647
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
and it has to be possible,

2648
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
because if it's not,

2649
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
you can't produce

2650
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
tons and tons of something.

2651
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
When it comes to

2652
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
legal thoughts

2653
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
and all that,

2654
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I'm on the author's side.

2655
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
If they took

2656
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
or learned

2657
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
that AI systems

2658
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
would have to be credited.

2659
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Or someone has to go there.

2660
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And from that point of view,

2661
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I'm a bit on the side of those who are now spreading some insults.

2662
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
That's also very nice, yes.

2663
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I think that's very good.

2664
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
You want a cat to be generated, and a car will be generated.

2665
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Or something like that.

2666
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
The picture has some information inside the picture.

2667
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Like a leather model.

2668
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I've heard that before.

2669
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Yes, like AI scrapes new data.

2670
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
And then you publish the picture.

2671
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You've just called it Nightshade.

2672
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Nightshade, something like that.

2673
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
That's what I've heard for the first time.

2674
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Yes.

2675
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And over time, AI learns it by heart.

2676
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
But when you look at the same picture, it looks normal.

2677
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
But in one pixel, there's some information that takes it over time.

2678
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And over time, it goes out to patch results.

2679
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
So if a cat is pre-generated, a dog is generated over time.

2680
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Okay, whatever.

2681
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
There's no antidote for that.

2682
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Okay.

2683
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
It's not that simple.

2684
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I'll tell you where I'd like to have AI.

2685
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And where Dejansko has it.

2686
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I did a study on this topic.

2687
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I'm a passionate gamer.

2688
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
For example, I don't watch TV.

2689
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Every night, my colleagues and I get together and shoot each other in virtual worlds.

2690
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
But Dejansko has a lot of cash in here.

2691
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And Dejansko has a lot of cheaters inside.

2692
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And some algorithms are developing.

2693
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Or some AI-powered detection.

2694
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That would be your gaming fingerprint, for example.

2695
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That is, if you read...

2696
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
To learn this model, what cheaters do, how you read.

2697
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Because all cheaters do the same.

2698
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
For example, I don't know.

2699
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
That is, if you have a measure on something.

2700
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And then a head appears and the cheater finds out.

2701
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
The measure goes directly to the head.

2702
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Because it's a faster headshot.

2703
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
That's auto-aim.

2704
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Auto-aim, yes.

2705
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But, for example, if you're holding a mouse.

2706
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You can have insanely good reflexes.

2707
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,000
But your hand will never go through the bi-pixel line on the headshot.

2708
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
That is, to find this model.

2709
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And to find the cheater.

2710
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And then, as I would say, your fingerprint.

2711
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And if you read the most, in one game there would be an AI repository.

2712
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Where you would log out of another game.

2713
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Or if you made a new account.

2714
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I mean, here I see...

2715
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Recognize a sample of your gameplay.

2716
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And then comes the blockchain.

2717
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
We're there.

2718
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Yes, that's it.

2719
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
In the blockchain, the cheaters are involved.

2720
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And it's forever.

2721
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
But here I see...

2722
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Because it's not frustrating at all.

2723
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
My colleague and I invest a lot of time in gaming.

2724
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
And you have some...

2725
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I'm an amateur, so it won't help.

2726
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
But a lot of time and you're good.

2727
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And then you lose against a cheater.

2728
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
It doesn't seem cool to you.

2729
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Bad UX.

2730
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yes, bad UX.

2731
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
That's it.

2732
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
OK.

2733
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I would like to go to some of our more common projects.

2734
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
To go back to our dear garden.

2735
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
At this point, if we're close to the end,

2736
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I would like to thank our partners and supporters.

2737
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
3FSO, Human Frog and again Kaldi.

2738
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Don't forget about our Patreons.

2739
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I hope we'll start doing more special things for Patreons.

2740
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But at the moment we don't have the capacity.

2741
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
There won't be much.

2742
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Yes?

2743
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I agree.

2744
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
We all support you.

2745
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
We all support you.

2746
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Let's talk a bit about the garden.

2747
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
What are we going to talk about?

2748
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I don't know...

2749
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Tell me why you work in the garden.

2750
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Why do I work in the garden?

2751
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
That's a good question.

2752
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Why does anyone work in the garden?

2753
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Not why anyone, why do you work in the garden.

2754
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I know, I know.

2755
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
It was so spontaneous in the beginning.

2756
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Because it seemed like there would be less work.

2757
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I connected with Oto.

2758
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Because Oto is just a recorder.

2759
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
He recorded in the lowest quality possible.

2760
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And there was nowhere to make a podcast out of it.

2761
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Or something like Work Your Magic.

2762
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And then it started.

2763
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And then there was your episode,

2764
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
where we put the cameras on the side.

2765
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And it was just me trying out the episode,

2766
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
or two, or three.

2767
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And then the whole season was recorded.

2768
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Somehow it became my project too.

2769
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I had a bit too much time.

2770
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You could hear it.

2771
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
You were fixing the audio.

2772
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Wait, you were on the side before Jan?

2773
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I wasn't on the side.

2774
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But Oto was...

2775
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
We know each other from Oto.

2776
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And I saw that what they produced was just a bit...

2777
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That they needed help.

2778
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
To be able to improve.

2779
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Politically correct.

2780
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
To be able to improve.

2781
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I was like, maybe Jan would be interested in that.

2782
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I was like, Jan, me, Oto, Oto, me, Jan.

2783
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And then...

2784
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Then we met in Maribor at a coffee.

2785
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
He told me how they do it.

2786
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I was a bit surprised.

2787
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I got the footage.

2788
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
They weren't the best.

2789
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
But yeah, those first few episodes were brutal.

2790
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I mean, you couldn't do anything with them.

2791
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Without AI you couldn't help them.

2792
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Nothing could help.

2793
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Then came the same amount of videos.

2794
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Then came the microphones.

2795
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And everything...

2796
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
It's just a bit better.

2797
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I would change everything.

2798
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I think I would change a lot of things.

2799
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It's good that you light up.

2800
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I don't have a flashlight that would light us up.

2801
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
But we would have a great camera.

2802
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Yeah, Pixis.

2803
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Dear sponsors...

2804
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
We're also preparing hardware.

2805
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah, Blackmagic will be on the market soon.

2806
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
New cameras that cost only 3000 euros per body.

2807
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
We're pretty modest, we'd only need three.

2808
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And a healthy lens.

2809
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Those lenses would be interesting.

2810
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah, there will be more.

2811
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
So it won't be just me.

2812
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I have a flashlight.

2813
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
But we don't have them.

2814
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Last night I was talking to Domna.

2815
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
The director of Human Frog.

2816
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And we were debating about branding.

2817
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Where do all these frogs go?

2818
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We have some stickers.

2819
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
They're pretty cheap.

2820
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
We'll put a commode on the camera.

2821
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
If not, the sponsors will...

2822
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
10 stickers.

2823
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Yeah, all their stickers will be all over.

2824
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Just in front of the lenses.

2825
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Not to be seen in the frame.

2826
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Maybe Blackmagic will make a custom one.

2827
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
An additional attachment.

2828
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
You can screw it on.

2829
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It's fixed.

2830
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Like a frog.

2831
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
We hope that Domna will call us.

2832
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
She's a big supporter.

2833
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Sometimes she comes to watch an episode with us.

2834
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
The rest of you are great.

2835
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
If anyone wants to come live,

2836
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
we haven't done it yet.

2837
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
The community is great.

2838
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Write to us.

2839
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
We'll change the commode if we can.

2840
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Last time we were in Maribor,

2841
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
how was it?

2842
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I think it was a question.

2843
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
If we're doing a meet-up.

2844
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Not yet, right?

2845
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
This is our meet-up.

2846
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
This is our meet-up.

2847
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
How did you come to Grodno?

2848
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Someone called me.

2849
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Was it you or Oto?

2850
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Definitely not me.

2851
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
We met here.

2852
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Oto said he'd come.

2853
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Oto introduced me as a guest.

2854
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But at the time he said

2855
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
if I remember correctly,

2856
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
it's been a year and a half now,

2857
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
he was thinking about

2858
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
making the first episode.

2859
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
The first episode

2860
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
with me.

2861
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It was the only episode

2862
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
with three cameras.

2863
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
There were three cameras.

2864
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
What?

2865
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Two Sony cameras and a Blackmagic camera.

2866
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I had two of my own cameras.

2867
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
For my needs.

2868
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I needed a conversation.

2869
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Every conversation was about

2870
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
a new gear purchase.

2871
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So I bought this flashlight

2872
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
that illuminates us today.

2873
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And a lamp.

2874
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And a stand.

2875
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I came here for a hobby.

2876
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Rub it in my face.

2877
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I came here as a video guy.

2878
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
He came here for a hobby.

2879
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
At the time,

2880
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I contacted

2881
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Oto.

2882
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
He was the best.

2883
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
At the time, Oto said

2884
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
if I wanted to be healthy again,

2885
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I'd do it with my hobby.

2886
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I was totally the best.

2887
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I'll tell you why I'm healthy.

2888
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Because I always get to know

2889
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
the guests.

2890
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
The guests are always phenomenal.

2891
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It's one of those activities

2892
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
where you grow up.

2893
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
In a personal way.

2894
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I always say,

2895
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
when I'm alone for two hours,

2896
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I need to eat,

2897
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
recharge,

2898
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
and spend a lot of time at home.

2899
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Why did we end up in Ljubljana?

2900
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
We're all from the east,

2901
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
like here.

2902
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
We're from Maribor.

2903
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Oto is also from Maribor.

2904
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
But everyone says

2905
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
this is the second episode

2906
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
for today.

2907
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Yes, that's right.

2908
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
A woman

2909
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
never asks

2910
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
why.

2911
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
She sees that I come home

2912
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
with a smile,

2913
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
that I come home because I love it.

2914
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Most of the time, I work from home.

2915
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I have

2916
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
very few advantages.

2917
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
But loneliness

2918
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
is not one of them.

2919
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
You can meet people

2920
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
with similar thoughts,

2921
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
with an overlap of interests,

2922
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
but knowing, thinking

2923
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
is priceless.

2924
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
With the biggest laugh

2925
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I go across the sea

2926
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
to film in Grodno,

2927
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
and with a big laugh

2928
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I come home,

2929
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
meet a new guest,

2930
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
see friends.

2931
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I have a similar experience.

2932
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I'm an outsider.

2933
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
It's interesting to see

2934
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
people in the tech sector.

2935
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
That's where I get

2936
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
that feeling.

2937
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
When Oto took me

2938
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
to a Make It conference

2939
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
this year,

2940
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I think

2941
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
people get to know each other

2942
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
much better than

2943
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
at our meetups.

2944
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Which meetups?

2945
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Like videography meetups?

2946
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I don't know.

2947
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
With Facebook groups.

2948
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I chat with more people

2949
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
in a global Blackmagic group.

2950
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Couldn't you do something

2951
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
for Blackmagic fans?

2952
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I could.

2953
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
No, no.

2954
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Not here.

2955
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Blackmagic fans.

2956
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I don't know if it's too little.

2957
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
They showed their hardware.

2958
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
It's too little.

2959
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
No, I don't think so.

2960
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
If you did that,

2961
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
it would be interesting.

2962
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It would be possible.

2963
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Could you make a movie about

2964
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Phil?

2965
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I don't know what it's called.

2966
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
You have a lot of movies.

2967
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
NAB in Slovenia.

2968
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I don't think so.

2969
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Probably Broadcasters.

2970
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Canon, Nikon, Neve.

2971
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I saw that.

2972
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Blackmagic, Neve, not yet.

2973
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
It's a business opportunity.

2974
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Yes.

2975
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Send me an e-mail.

2976
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Send me an e-mail.

2977
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I will represent Europe.

2978
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
We let you down a bit.

2979
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
You came to Grodno

2980
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
because you couldn't watch

2981
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
the old logo.

2982
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Yes, that's it.

2983
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I think I heard

2984
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
that you should change

2985
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
the logo.

2986
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
What did you watch

2987
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
this summer?

2988
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Everything was good.

2989
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
We changed it

2990
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
from time to time.

2991
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Then you need

2992
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
to find a moment

2993
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
when you can devote yourself to it.

2994
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I came here because

2995
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I've known Otto

2996
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
for almost 20 years.

2997
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And you made him laugh.

2998
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yes, I made him laugh.

2999
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
It was a cool idea.

3000
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
It's similar to

3001
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
what we do in Maribor.

3002
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
The community,

3003
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
the knowledge,

3004
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
the connection

3005
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
of all actors

3006
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
seemed very important to me.

3007
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
In this format.

3008
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It was interesting

3009
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
to see how it can be done.

3010
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
How fast it grows.

3011
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It grows very fast.

3012
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Now that you mentioned

3013
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
the meeting hours,

3014
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I don't know.

3015
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It was a coincidence.

3016
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
You have two microphones.

3017
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
It's very convenient.

3018
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
You can bring the camera

3019
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
by yourself.

3020
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
If I don't sit there,

3021
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I have to do something.

3022
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
The photos are very quiet.

3023
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Not like my old Canon

3024
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
where the glass

3025
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
would make some noise.

3026
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
It hurts me when I see your photos

3027
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
because I know

3028
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
how much your old camera

3029
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
costs.

3030
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I know how much my camera

3031
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
costs.

3032
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I don't see such a difference.

3033
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I don't like

3034
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
purchases.

3035
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
But yes,

3036
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
meeting hours are cool.

3037
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Now that you mentioned

3038
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
overspending for the game.

3039
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Do you think you overspend for the game?

3040
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Or what kind of conversation

3041
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
do you have about overspending for the game?

3042
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I try to overspend

3043
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
for the game

3044
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
that I will need.

3045
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I make sure that

3046
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I have everything on the way.

3047
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
If I have too much

3048
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
of everything.

3049
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I like to be compact.

3050
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Basically, all the equipment

3051
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
for this setup

3052
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
can be carried alone

3053
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
in one.

3054
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
For the podcast.

3055
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
When I buy something,

3056
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
it means two trips to the car

3057
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
or home.

3058
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
It makes

3059
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
a lot of sense to

3060
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
overspend for an old camera

3061
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
that worked great.

3062
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
But then you see that it's there

3063
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
and you have to replace it

3064
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
and clean it.

3065
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
That's my blockade.

3066
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I do a lot of different

3067
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
projects

3068
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
outside of work

3069
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
and elsewhere.

3070
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I don't know

3071
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
what kind of construction

3072
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I would build

3073
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
instead of getting

3074
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
boards and wood for the garage

3075
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
and now I need beams.

3076
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And it doesn't have to be

3077
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
just one beam.

3078
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
You need a lot.

3079
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
You can do it.

3080
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
What do you

3081
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
overspend?

3082
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I bought

3083
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
a new Apple which was

3084
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
expensive.

3085
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But I think that

3086
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
when I started working on it

3087
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
which was done without

3088
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Macbook A16

3089
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
which was

3090
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
done, I think

3091
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
that's the price

3092
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
and I don't overspend

3093
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
on equipment.

3094
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I have an iPad

3095
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
which is 7 years old

3096
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
and it's still working.

3097
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
We both dropped the same thing

3098
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
on a bag.

3099
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Yes, the same thing.

3100
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Books

3101
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
and flour

3102
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
for baking bread.

3103
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Flour?

3104
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Yes.

3105
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Flour?

3106
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
It's never too much.

3107
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Wait, how much do you overspend

3108
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
on flour?

3109
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Classic flour

3110
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
or exotic flour?

3111
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I don't know how exotic

3112
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
you can go

3113
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
on a fresh summer.

3114
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
You could buy

3115
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
your own flour and live

3116
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
and hang out.

3117
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I think we went a bit too far.

3118
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
If you have

3119
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
a final thought

3120
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
because we are

3121
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
being chased.

3122
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
As you would say,

3123
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
it's a bit noisy

3124
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
and we are 90 minutes

3125
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
away from the demo.

3126
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
We have an hour and a half

3127
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
left on the disc.

3128
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Let me tell you

3129
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
how it went.

3130
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I'm still choosing

3131
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
who to talk about it with.

3132
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I hope you will.

3133
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
You tell me, it's cool.

3134
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
What do you mean?

3135
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
How do you feel

3136
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
about the first episodes?

3137
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I could have prepared

3138
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
a bit more.

3139
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I went a bit crazy

3140
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
because we all know each other

3141
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
and he is a local.

3142
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I don't see who will listen

3143
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
and watch it.

3144
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I'm OK with it.

3145
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It would be nice

3146
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
if we recorded

3147
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
the first episode first.

3148
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
But yeah,

3149
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
it's been a long day.

3150
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
As far as I'm concerned,

3151
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
you are a top leader.

3152
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Thank you.

3153
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
You are a great guest.

3154
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Thank you.

3155
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
You complement me a bit.

3156
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I hope we didn't lose

3157
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
anyone from the listeners.

3158
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I don't think so.

3159
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
No one will hear the final plug

3160
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and like and subscribe.

3161
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Do you have a plug?

3162
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Where is it?

3163
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
On YouTube.

3164
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
On YouTube.

3165
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
It's youtube.com

3166
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
slash Tomas Zaman.

3167
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I'm posting shit on Twitter

3168
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
without the listeners.

3169
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Also Tomas Zaman.

3170
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
That's all the social media I use.

3171
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
That's it.

3172
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I only post shit

3173
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
on Twitter.

3174
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
On Instagram

3175
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I write and

3176
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
rely on AI.

3177
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Handle.

3178
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Yes.

3179
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Brits.

3180
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Yes.

3181
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I don't have a plug.

3182
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
That's it.

3183
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Thank you for listening

3184
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
and watching

3185
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
our

3186
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
very friendly

3187
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
conversations.

3188
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Thanks to the supporters

3189
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Human Frog, 3FSO and Kaldi.

3190
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And of course to Patreon.

3191
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Come here.

3192
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Come here.

3193
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
With joy

3194
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I'm waiting

3195
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
for the comments

3196
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
to see if we have any trolls.

3197
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
We don't.

3198
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I'm waiting for trolls.

3199
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
There's a comment

3200
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
saying we don't have effective trolls.

3201
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I think we haven't managed

3202
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
to troll in the city.

3203
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
We haven't managed

3204
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
if we don't have good trolls.

3205
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Too few haters, too few trolls.

3206
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I think the city is full

3207
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
of...

3208
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I don't know.

3209
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
What do you think?

3210
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Thanks for listening.

3211
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Bye.
