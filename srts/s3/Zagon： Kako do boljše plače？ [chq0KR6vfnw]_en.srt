00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to the 5th episode of the 3rd season of the podcast in Grodje, in Zagon.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today we will talk about payments and other types of compensation in this sector in Slovenia.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Nika Anžel and Miha Medven are with me today. Welcome.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
As we thought about the topics that are constantly appearing, we realized that we do not have to go beyond payments.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I must admit that the response to the previous episodes surprised me a lot.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It is incredible how many questions we got.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
As I said at the beginning, we will not be able to cover all of them, because there are a lot of them.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We will touch on this in the next episodes.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Today we will talk more specifically about payments.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We will focus on the technical area in Slovenia, but we will also talk about the international space.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why am I inviting Nika and Miha today?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Nika Anžel has been helping in the Slovenian community for the last 5 years.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
She also helps with the search for personnel, especially technical personnel.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
She comes from the Agency for the Search and Selection of Personnel.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Welcome, Nika. Would you like to add something?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I would not.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As I said, for the last 5 years, we have been working together.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Especially in the positions where the IT market has opened up due to the coronavirus.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We have been working on tattoos, especially for the Slovenian sector.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Great. Miha, you are a very visible member of the Slovenian technical community.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You come across your name either on the Slovenian developers or through your content on YouTube for freelancers.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This has also contributed a lot to this part of the Slovenian technical community.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You have worked a lot in start-ups.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now you are also in the first international company with a much larger business.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I am currently involved there.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Would you like to add something?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Or I have to add something.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And of course, first of all, why are you here today?

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I paid for your survey.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
On behalf of the whole of Slovenia, thank you for your time.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And that every year you really take time for this.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think we all see a lot of added value from this.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But of course, we will talk about this a little later.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I would like to start on your behalf.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The post-COVID period was very interesting.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean, the COVID period was very interesting.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think it changed the whole industry a lot.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But in this sector in general, I think there was a big shift.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now we are four years later.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How did you experience this time, but also in general?

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What trends did you notice at that time?

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I think one thing is when we think about trends and the current situation.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
As a person, you always go back to when you started your career.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And then you base all your experiences on it.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So I started at 22 years old after a big financial crisis.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And at that time it was very, very, very bad.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And anything after that is very good.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So people who started in the time of Corona and after Corona in the IT sector

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
experienced the biggest boom in their lives.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because the market share of the IT sector was so high

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that almost every month we had a budget of 500 to 1,000 euros more for the same job.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And that was, on the one hand, very nice to see.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
On the other hand, I expected that it would slowly go down.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The market returns to normal levels.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And we have a feeling that there is the greatest stagnation and recession.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Despite the fact that our sector still lives very well today.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The salaries are still very high.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A lot of companies are working very hard for us.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Not every day there are 10 new employees, but only one.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It has calmed down a bit after Corona.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It was logical that it could not be sustained.

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So now I see a healthy, calm environment.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Trends have slowed down a bit, or are slowly returning to normal.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I hope that most of the layoffs are over.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You never know, but now I feel that it has calmed down a bit.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We'll see how it will be in six months.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What I have learned in the last three years is that the next 14 days are not crucial.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They change very quickly for you.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So that's my take on the last four years.

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I lost a lot of voice.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I made some mistakes, but it was fine.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can see all the trends in the polls.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We went from a non-remote company to a very remote company.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Salaries went up.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A lot of employees were replaced.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Some of you met in the dark four years ago.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
As you said in the introduction,

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
there was an explosion of inquiries about engineers.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You were there as well.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How do you see the last four years?

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I saw that you were moving, but I also saw that you were moving away a bit.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes, that's true.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think the whole corona has grown.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A lot of inquiries, too few employees.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Everyone turned to IT.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
At the end of 2022, I still experience layoffs.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They started because of Google and Facebook layoffs in the US.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
American companies in Slovenia started because of that.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A lot of companies went into layoffs because they lost their projects.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A lot of them went into layoffs because they were afraid of the economic situation.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They said, we've grown too much.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We've gone crazy.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now we're going to cool down a bit.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Maybe we weren't together or didn't perform well.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We were preparing for a crisis.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It didn't come to this.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I hope it won't come.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Last month, there was a story.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Less than 40% of people went into layoffs because of the lack of projects.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know how long it lasted.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I still accept these stories from time to time.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
As Miha said, the market is still shrinking.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There's still a shortage.

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There are positions, but maybe not that many.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
As far as pay is concerned, I'd say they're growing.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Not as abnormally as before.

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But the conditions are much more demanding for candidates.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They don't give everyone a good salary.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They choose who they're going to hire.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In an ordinary profile, it looks like a big difference.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I remember four years ago, you were voting for some juniors for some contests.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You asked yourself, are you really ready to pay so much for such a cadre?

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Did it change a bit?

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Did the company become more demanding?

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They don't hire us for juniors anymore.

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We're looking for specialists, mid-to-seniors.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think they've learned that it's not good to hire someone just because you need him.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You have to look at the individual fit,

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and that the person contributes to the company for the money you give him.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm aware of that.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It was different a year ago.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Today, I think it's a bit more understandable.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There are more offers for juniors now.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It takes a year, a year and a half for people to know

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that they can start with a junior position.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
At the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of people started looking for IT jobs.

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Now we have a lot of juniors, but there are no jobs for them.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I have a feeling that it's much harder to find the first jobs,

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
because the criteria are much higher.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You can show a lot more, more references, a portfolio,

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
than maybe before or after the pandemic.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There are a lot more offers for juniors now.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
As a junior, is it easy to pay off your debt today?

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is the market today like, thank you, you've come to the service,

136
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
or is it a market where you also pay off your debt as a junior

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and you also get involved in that part of the service life?

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think you always have to pay off your debt.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
As a junior, you have a very, very small position.

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's still a matter of compensation.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's still a matter of debate.

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I know that the word is paying off, but it's a dialogue

143
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
between the employer and the employee.

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you tell someone else that you want to have a job tonight,

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
or something like that,

146
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
as a junior, I also want to fulfill my wish.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know, a research conference, an education budget,

148
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
similar tasks.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
As a junior, I don't think there will be any intention

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
if we start doing these tasks.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's not a lot of space, but they are different tasks.

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's my opinion.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You also know how much you can show as a junior.

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
As a junior, you can get out of the fax,

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you don't have to work as hard as you did on the fax.

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
As a junior, you have a lot of private projects,

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you are interested in a lot of things.

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
For example, you work as a student.

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you can show something,

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think you can always pay off your debt.

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Does this entry-level salary and this entry-level profile

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
make such a difference?

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Does it also increase the amount of compensation?

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think it increases everything.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't know if there was a bigger advantage for this entry-level.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Every year it goes up.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
How much it goes up depends on the year and the profile,

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
but it increases.

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
As we have a higher minimum and average salary every year,

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
these salaries also increase.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't think there is such a drastic difference.

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't think there is such a drastic difference.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Criteria change.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now a junior has to show more than two years ago.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If you only had a desire for programming,

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and then you started programming again,

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and then you could start a good job,

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
today it is no longer the case.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Paying is the best thing, but it takes a lot.

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
As a reply to the question,

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I would say that the salary is the most important thing.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Paying is the best thing, but it takes a lot.

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
As a reply to the question,

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
we work a lot with young people,

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
because we have a special program for educating young people.

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Paying in vocational profiles,

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
in children's profiles,

188
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
has definitely increased for the entry-level.

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Not only for engineering or programming.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It is simply inflation.

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
In the past, young people were completely unemployed,

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and today they all got a job.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think it was also related to that.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I mean, if you ask a boomer,

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
they don't know what to do.

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They don't know what to do.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I can tell you,

198
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
when I started working with young people,

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
we had an entry-level.

200
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm not talking about IT.

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We were 3,000-4,000 people.

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Today, we are 1,800-2,000 people.

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Go.

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Even if you go to a public place,

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and you have a shop,

206
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't remember how many people there are,

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
because there are too few people who would work full-time.

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We have a record low unemployment.

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
There is a pressure from that side.

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because someone still has to manage that job.

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Even if you don't need it as much as during the coronavirus,

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
people still go to work.

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
They change jobs.

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Absolutely.

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
COVID has completely shaken us.

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What is important to us is the value.

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It seems to me that, in the end,

218
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
it has helped us a little bit

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
with a little more decentralization in Ljubljana.

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If I'm right,

221
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
it is the call back to office.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't want to say that you have to work

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
for a week or two in the office,

224
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but it seems to me that

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
it has shaken us as a society.

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
First, I would like to clarify

227
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
some basic concepts,

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and then I would like to focus

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
a little more on the survey,

230
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
because you have been collecting data for some time.

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But first, let's talk about wages

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and salaries.

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's clear up this brutal debate.

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What are we talking about?

235
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Salaries? Salaries? Salaries?

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Salaries?

237
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What is in the best interest of a candidate

238
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
who is talking about wages?

239
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If I'm right, you can start.

240
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I have a very strict opinion,

241
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
but I will start.

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We have a lot of money.

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think that if you want to be a candidate for protection,

244
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to be treated as much as you expect,

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
it is good to know what the difference is.

246
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There are a lot of calculators on the Internet,

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
so it is not easy to look at these things.

248
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But there is always a lot of talk about wages.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I would like to clarify

250
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
the specifics of the Slovenian market,

251
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
when we talk about wages.

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We are not talking about compensation,

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
because there are also regressions

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and the return of various expenses,

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
which can cause a lot of problems

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
at the end of the month.

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think that we are still in the middle of

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
understanding gross wages.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What else would you understand

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
as gross compensation,

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
which is much more expanded in the EU,

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
because it pays two-thirds of all other bonuses

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and additional workers.

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It is a very large employer.

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Gross wages are the same

266
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
from the point of view of a specific person.

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The distance from the company

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
is different at the end of the month,

269
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
but in the end,

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
we are talking about gross wages.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That would be one of the reasons

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
why I went to do this survey.

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So that I could start talking about

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the importance of gross wages

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
in the EU.

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I started talking about the importance

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
of talking about gross wages,

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and when we get used to it,

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
we will move on to compensation.

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But Miha, I don't care

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
what the company pays.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I only care about my employees.

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Why don't we talk about gross wages?

284
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And then there are the SPs,

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and I don't know what else.

286
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I have a lot of these debates,

287
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
so I am a bit triggered.

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I think this is the basis

289
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
for googling,

290
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
so you know what the system is.

291
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
When you get an offer from a company,

292
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
you can always ask them to prepare

293
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
the first calculation of the payment.

294
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can see for yourself

295
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
how much it will cost.

296
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
One of the stories I heard a lot

297
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
was that I changed my salary,

298
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
then I went to the hospital for a month,

299
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and then back to work.

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's like you said,

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
you are a member of a company,

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
then you have a child,

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and then you don't even expect it.

304
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You work for a long time.

305
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's why it seems to me

306
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that gross wages are the same,

307
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
because we are more on the same level.

308
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We talk about the same things,

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
because as you said,

310
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
it depends on each individual.

311
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's nice for us as individuals

312
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to be able to get gross wages.

313
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It would be a lot easier

314
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
if we paid ourselves.

315
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Gross wages are the basis.

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It seems to me that everything

317
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
puts us on the same level

318
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
as other people.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What are the gross wages

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
in recent years?

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I have a big problem

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
when it comes to gross wages.

323
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Most of the debate is about gross wages.

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Gross wages are a bit complicated.

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If we have 2 euros,

326
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
then 10 euros is 4 gross wages.

327
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We will be disappointed.

328
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I always try to talk about the media,

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
which means that 50% of people

330
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
in Slovenia deserve less than that.

331
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In the last survey,

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
it was between 3,000 and 3,500 gross wages.

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That means that more than 50% of people

334
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
deserve less than that.

335
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you deserve more than 6,000 gross wages,

336
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you are already in the top 10%.

337
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If you don't have that salary,

338
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
if you don't get that salary,

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
if you get a salary of 4,000 euros,

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
you are in the top 1% of employees in Slovenia.

341
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
On the one hand, that is a big number,

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
but on the other hand,

343
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I thought it was millions.

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
These are the figures that give you

345
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
a different perspective.

346
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Gross wages are more about distribution.

347
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Few people have a figure

348
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
of 3,000-3,500 euros.

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If you deserve less than that,

350
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
you know where you are.

351
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If you deserve more than that,

352
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
you know where you are.

353
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That is every two years for 500 euros.

354
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Do you remember the first survey?

355
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yes, 2,500 euros.

356
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The first survey was 6 years ago.

357
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It was accurate, but not accurate.

358
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
People don't know exactly what it is.

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I try to be accurate with 500 euros.

360
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I looked at it,

361
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
2,000-2,500 euros was an average of 2,800 euros.

362
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It is probably a big leap for the Slovenian industry.

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Is it a leap for this industry?

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It is huge.

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
In Slovenia, we have the SPF phenomenon.

366
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
SPFs have more income

367
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
if we equate them with employees.

368
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The biggest characteristic

369
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
is that most of them work

370
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
for companies that are on this market.

371
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
A Slovenian employee is primarily employed

372
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
for a Slovenian company that works

373
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
on the Slovenian market.

374
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you work for a company that works

375
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
on this market, if it is also Slovenian,

376
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
you will get a higher salary.

377
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
If we have big Slovenian names

378
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
in our business,

379
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
they have locations in Slovenia,

380
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
they work for Europe and America,

381
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
they get a higher salary.

382
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The work is exactly the same.

383
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
One of the biggest stereotypes

384
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and reservations

385
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I hear from Slovenian developers

386
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
is that if a person pays me

387
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
three times more,

388
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
what can I do for that money?

389
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Is it really the same?

390
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It is the same.

391
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We have a Slovenian company

392
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that employs Slovenes

393
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
from the wider Balkan region.

394
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
They pay them 3-5 thousand euros

395
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
which is a good salary.

396
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
They sell them as an agency

397
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
to American companies

398
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
for three times more money.

399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And they work side by side

400
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
with their American colleagues.

401
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Documentation has opened up new areas

402
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
where you can learn this.

403
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The only problem is that

404
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the work you do can be taken over.

405
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If you make a 10% difference

406
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
for a Slovenian company,

407
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you earn 100 euros.

408
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
If you make a 10% difference

409
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
for an American company,

410
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
your average programmer is the same.

411
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The elite may be different

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
because they have different access

413
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
to problems that can be solved.

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
In Slovenia, there are very few companies

415
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
that have the same scale as Google.

416
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Some specific knowledge exists,

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
but there are very few people

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
who know what it means.

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I haven't seen any difference in me.

420
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We make the same mistakes,

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
we get confused because of the same problems.

422
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We have the same problems.

423
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You work a lot in Slovenia,

424
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but also in the Balkans.

425
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What is the difference?

426
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What is the difference?

427
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You don't pay more,

428
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
but you work a lot.

429
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You work a lot,

430
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
but you don't pay more.

431
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You work a lot,

432
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
but you don't pay more.

433
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I call him a rockstar candidate, that's why it's important.

434
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Because they can work with big systems, with scalability and so on,

435
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
but I think that the difference is not very rare.

436
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
When you find the difference, or if you already find the difference,

437
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
it's more for smaller products.

438
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I will connect this a little more with ESPM, because you also changed ESPM.

439
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You started in 2010.

440
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I remember that time, 2008, and that post-2008,

441
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
when there were no more regular services.

442
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
All the engineers could be ESPM,

443
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
you got a year for a certain time,

444
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but more or less everything went to ESPM,

445
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and then at one point, of course, the legislation changed,

446
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and then it all turned upside down.

447
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
All the ESPM people started,

448
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but if Freedom were in your position,

449
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
you would miss that.

450
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And now you have both,

451
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
that's for both questions,

452
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but you also have to pay attention to ESPM,

453
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and today it is, as you said, a means for work, for income,

454
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and in the end, how can Slovenian companies compete

455
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
with this broken ESPM,

456
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
which has a lot more data and data.

457
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Do you want to start or should I start?

458
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes, I think that certain Slovenian companies

459
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
use this practice.

460
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Let's not talk about them.

461
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
There are a lot of them in this practice,

462
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
also because of the stability that they want,

463
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
if someone gets a job.

464
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I also pay attention to the fact that lately,

465
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
a lot of people have been talking about

466
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
regular employment and the possibility of a loan,

467
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and so on, some kind of special security

468
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
especially in these unstable times,

469
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and maybe they also got caught up in some international affairs,

470
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that they were on ESPM and then the project was cancelled.

471
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So I won't say that now the trend is to move from ESPM

472
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
to regular employees,

473
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
but I do see some signals in the market.

474
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I would like to add here,

475
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
because I talk a lot about ESPM,

476
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and in my survey I have a lot of questions,

477
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
whether you work on ESPM or not,

478
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and in fact there are 15 or 17% who are only ESPM employees.

479
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
All the other 75% are regular employees,

480
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and 10% of these regular employees also have half-day ESPM.

481
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Which means that this is a small number.

482
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What I think is that this number,

483
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
which works for TOINO,

484
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
is on a higher level,

485
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and they are talked about more,

486
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
because they are also part of some groups,

487
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and all those guest debates that we have on Facebook,

488
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
this is perhaps also a little hidden,

489
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
as if the whole of Slovenia is on ESPM.

490
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, no.

491
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I have been studying this for 4-5 years,

492
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and only 20% are ESPM employees.

493
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Of course, ESPM employees deserve more money,

494
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
if we look at their income,

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
but I think that this is also a very good topic,

496
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
which we can discuss a little,

497
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
because there is a little bit of data optimization,

498
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and all that stuff.

499
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The good thing is that,

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
when the global market opens up,

501
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think that ESPM is a good alternative

502
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
for smaller companies,

503
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
that they are competitive in terms of pay,

504
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
because larger companies can offer you

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
as little through employment,

506
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
as a smaller legal company can through ESPM.

507
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And now I see some added value,

508
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
that these Slovenian startups

509
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
may pay a little more for this,

510
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
because there is optimization on both sides.

511
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Because in the end,

512
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
most people look at how much we get

513
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
at the end on the bank account,

514
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
which went to a very small amount.

515
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I think that's how it is.

516
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
A lot is said about ESPM,

517
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
but I don't know how serious the problems are.

518
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Maybe it's not as serious as a problem,

519
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
it's more of a question,

520
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and if it's a completely different league,

521
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and we don't mess with them,

522
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
then maybe Slovenian companies

523
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
are losing out in terms of competition

524
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
because of ESPM.

525
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
On the other hand,

526
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
if you work as a contractor for an American company,

527
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
is your alternative really a local Slovenian company?

528
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

529
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You are in a different market,

530
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
you are on a different level.

531
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I think that ESPM makes the Slovenian market

532
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
more competitive,

533
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
especially because it reduces costs.

534
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Without that, it would be much harder for Slovenian companies.

535
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The big ones are mostly in employment,

536
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
the small ones have good legal and accounting services.

537
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, I don't know.

538
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't know if it depends on the community,

539
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
or the programmers, or the company,

540
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
what we want to do.

541
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Because I remember those days

542
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
when ESPM came,

543
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
because they didn't want to have unemployed people.

544
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
They said, here's ESPM,

545
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
we'll give you 5,000 euros for two years,

546
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
make a company out of them,

547
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and then we made a one-man band,

548
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and 10 years later we still have them,

549
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and we're small-scale contractors.

550
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I remember that.

551
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I forgot about that.

552
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It was still 5,000 euros,

553
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and we all went to ESPM.

554
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
If you wait another year without a job,

555
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
you get additional benefits.

556
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We all go to ESPM,

557
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
just because we don't have unemployed people,

558
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and 10 years later we have a small situation.

559
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't know.

560
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's a good question.

561
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's more historical.

562
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Maybe in Slovenia,

563
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
companies employ people at ESPM,

564
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
or you can work through ESPM,

565
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and they can employ you.

566
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There are also other solutions

567
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
for how companies can employ you.

568
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
For example, companies in Tojina

569
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
have an Employer of Records,

570
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
or an agency for employment.

571
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Besides that,

572
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
do our companies also serve

573
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
in the market,

574
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
or what do you think?

575
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What are the forms of employment?

576
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If we're talking about Slovenian companies,

577
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
that would employ Tujans,

578
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
we have offered this form many times,

579
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Employer of Records,

580
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
but it didn't work out.

581
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Maybe they didn't know about it,

582
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
maybe it wasn't well-developed yet.

583
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Usually, they want a B2B contract,

584
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
which means that,

585
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
if a Tujan employs a Slovenian company,

586
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
then the Slovenian company

587
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
has a lot of companies in the Balkans,

588
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
so they can employ them.

589
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But usually, they want you

590
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
to work as an SP,

591
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
or a part of a company

592
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
that exists in the same country,

593
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and then you sign a contract

594
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
as a B2B contractor,

595
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
according to the agreement.

596
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We have applied to various services,

597
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but I don't know,

598
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I think that the Slovenian law

599
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
isn't that great yet,

600
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
it's a grey area,

601
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and companies are a bit afraid,

602
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
as you said,

603
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
they haven't been properly

604
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
investigated yet,

605
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and then it's easier for them

606
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
to say to the candidate

607
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
that from the company,

608
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
we will sign a B2B contract.

609
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Can you explain a bit

610
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
what an EOR is,

611
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
for those who don't know.

612
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It means that

613
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
you are employed

614
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
with a company

615
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
that has registered...

616
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
OK, I can't talk about

617
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
name companies now,

618
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but there is a company

619
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
that specializes in

620
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
employing people

621
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and then giving them

622
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to you voluntarily

623
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
through an agreement.

624
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
They are employed

625
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
in a company

626
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
that is based in Slovenia,

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
so that other companies

628
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
can hire their employees,

629
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
even if they are not hired,

630
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and then that company

631
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
does all the financial things

632
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
for those employees,

633
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and it's like they are

634
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
employed in their own country,

635
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and then they are employed

636
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
to you.

637
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Then you pay an account

638
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
every month,

639
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and they cover all the social benefits,

640
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and all the administrative

641
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and financial things.

642
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So, you are employed

643
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
in a company in your country,

644
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and you work for another company.

645
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Which means that

646
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
you also have all the benefits,

647
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and the laws guarantee you

648
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
your own country,

649
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
not the one you work in.

650
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So, today,

651
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
there is only one form of employment,

652
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
an agreement in employment,

653
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
in Slovenia or in EU,

654
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and in Slovenian legislation

655
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
you have regress,

656
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and if your company

657
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that employs you does not follow it,

658
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
it is in a legal violation.

659
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Large companies cannot be opened

660
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
by employees in Slovenia,

661
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
because if you do not pay,

662
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
you do not know all the hackers.

663
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I have also heard that

664
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
it is not possible to work

665
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
as an employee.

666
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Employees want to have

667
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
a safe job,

668
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
so that the American state,

669
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but also the wider society,

670
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
can trust you.

671
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You have unemployment,

672
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and of course,

673
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
the best is a hospital.

674
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We optimize for different things

675
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
in life.

676
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
As you said,

677
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
you need a loan,

678
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
which looks different

679
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
in this period of life,

680
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
than some agreement

681
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that has a two-week

682
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
repayment period.

683
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I can tell you something very interesting.

684
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
A few of our clients

685
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
contacted us,

686
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
who have the Employee of Record service,

687
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
to help them as partners

688
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
in Slovenia,

689
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
so it looks like they are interested

690
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
in the market,

691
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that they have a potential market,

692
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and they support this service for us.

693
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
My experience,

694
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
from the point of view of the company,

695
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
is that if you choose

696
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
a good provider,

697
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
which has partners all over the world,

698
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
it means that you have entities

699
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
all over the world,

700
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and you can work anywhere.

701
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The fees are different,

702
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
depending on the location,

703
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
how complicated the legislation

704
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
is there,

705
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
but if you are

706
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
a remote provider,

707
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
it is possible

708
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
to hire

709
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
a lot of people.

710
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There are also

711
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
gentlemen in suits,

712
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
who are happy that they are

713
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
in compliance with all the rules,

714
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and that you have a contractor.

715
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
How do the candidates perceive this?

716
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Do they prefer to have a contractor,

717
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
or does it suit them?

718
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
My experience is that

719
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the market is remote,

720
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
because we do not

721
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
work with contractors,

722
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
which means

723
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that we are completely

724
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
non-competitive in Eastern Europe.

725
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In the whole of Eastern Europe

726
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and the Balkans,

727
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
we have our SPs,

728
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
we are much more conservative

729
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
for such a remote company,

730
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
which can pay you internationally,

731
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
because it means that

732
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
half of the country will take you.

733
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
If you are already at this level,

734
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
you are a 100 or 200 euro engineer,

735
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you do not have any interest

736
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
in being 70 euros per year

737
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
on the account,

738
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
because of compliance.

739
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That was the biggest learning.

740
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The biggest learning was

741
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
that simply

742
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a club with a global level

743
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
of compensation

744
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
is no longer competitive,

745
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
because people could

746
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
go to meetings.

747
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I think that

748
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the SP is not a Slovenian thing,

749
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
but it is also Poland,

750
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the Czech Republic, Croatia,

751
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Serbia,

752
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
the whole of Eastern Europe,

753
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Bulgaria, Romania.

754
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It is easier for them

755
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
to be at the SP

756
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
than to be an employee.

757
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I mentioned 100 or 200

758
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
engineers

759
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
per year.

760
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
One question came up

761
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
very interesting,

762
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
what is the difference

763
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
between 100 or 200 engineers?

764
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
These are really important

765
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
global compensations,

766
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
not Slovenian.

767
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
In Slovenian,

768
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I would speak a little less.

769
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Is it really an elite engineer?

770
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
How many do we have in Slovenia?

771
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
What is the difference?

772
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
How do you work as an engineer?

773
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
As I said,

774
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
if we look at 1%

775
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
of employees in the economy

776
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and 4,000 net,

777
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
8,000 brut,

778
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
how much is it?

779
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
100 euros per month.

780
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What I mean is

781
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
that these are people

782
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
who are very, very rare.

783
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We know

784
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
at least 10 of them.

785
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Slovenia is a small market,

786
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
so we know

787
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
who these people are.

788
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The biggest criticism

789
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
is that their IT impact

790
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
is not programming,

791
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
but business impact.

792
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
At that time,

793
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
there could be a lot of differences.

794
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I will say that if you are employed,

795
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
it is quite difficult to get to those numbers.

796
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
If you are an SP, a freelancer,

797
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
or something like that,

798
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
you play by the rules,

799
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but you have more employees,

800
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
then this contribution is not so unattainable.

801
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
But then you are a subcontractor

802
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and you have employees

803
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and you are often the best agency

804
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and so on and so on.

805
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So I have a lot of debates.

806
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I was always an SP,

807
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
a freelancer,

808
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
but I had 5-10 contractors

809
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and because I couldn't do anything,

810
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I hired someone else

811
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
to fix it.

812
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And because at one point

813
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
it is no longer paying,

814
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but it is the income of the company.

815
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
100 euros per year for the income of the company

816
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
is not such a big amount

817
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
if there are 4, 5, 6 people employed.

818
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I would say

819
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to think more about the income

820
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
if you want to have those contributions.

821
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because if you pay too much,

822
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
it will be difficult for you to get there.

823
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Let's be open.

824
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm talking about Slovenia.

825
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Have you sponsored any engineers

826
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
for 100 euros in Slovenia?

827
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Not in Slovenia.

828
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
If we are talking about developers,

829
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
we are not talking about some government CTO.

830
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No, we are not talking about VP,

831
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
VP of engineering,

832
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
individual contributor,

833
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
programmer.

834
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
No, not in Slovenia.

835
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Do you have a goal in mind?

836
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Can you say something like

837
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
wow, that would be cool?

838
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I have 10 euros

839
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
per month of compensation

840
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
of Bruto SP.

841
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
10,000 euros

842
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
was for a company

843
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
that is going for

844
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
an operational role

845
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
of which there are only 50 in Slovenia

846
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and this company

847
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
was one of the companies that did that

848
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and it was worth it,

849
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
not the programming,

850
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
but the fact that it was able to

851
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
provide that service to its customers.

852
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's why it was so expensive.

853
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I remember a similar contribution,

854
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
but it was so expensive

855
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
for a Slovenian company,

856
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
but not entirely owned by Slovenia.

857
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So I don't have to say

858
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
that we paid in Slovenia.

859
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But I would like to

860
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
ask you about that,

861
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
because I have a personal

862
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
foolproof way

863
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
that I think

864
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
100K engineers do.

865
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But since we are talking

866
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
about pay and careers,

867
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
what is the world

868
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
like for someone?

869
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
How do you get to that level?

870
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
How do you start?

871
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Here we are quite connected

872
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
also with the

873
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
stay and learn

874
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
or move and earn

875
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
debate.

876
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
How do you optimize your career

877
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
so that you can get

878
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
to that level of compensation?

879
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
If we are talking about Slovenia,

880
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and that you are just a programmer,

881
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
we have to wait

882
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
for the inflation to come

883
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
so that we can get to 100 euros,

884
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
which I honestly think is impossible.

885
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
If we connect,

886
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
your skills are not only connected

887
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
with programming,

888
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
but also with launching

889
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
new products or opening

890
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
some verticals or horizontals

891
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
for more income.

892
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
These are a bit easier to achieve.

893
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But then you are not just a programmer,

894
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
but you are something else.

895
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Maybe a leadership role,

896
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
more product oriented.

897
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
What is the purpose of a career?

898
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
First you have to develop a skillset,

899
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
then you have to learn

900
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
how to sell well.

901
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
At the beginning of a career,

902
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
you have to optimize your skillset.

903
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
In the second half of your career,

904
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
you try to sell better.

905
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
What does it look like?

906
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
For me, it looks like a freelancer,

907
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
for some it looks like

908
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
they change jobs,

909
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
have their own startup projects,

910
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
go to conferences.

911
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Then there is a grind.

912
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Every new job

913
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
has to be 20% higher.

914
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Or 30% higher.

915
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
If you replace 10,

916
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
it's 30 days.

917
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
30 days.

918
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Maybe it's different

919
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
or for some other

920
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
leadership role.

921
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I would say that

922
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
engineers and programmers

923
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
pay 12-20%

924
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
difference

925
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
than me.

926
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But higher percentages

927
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
are more responsible

928
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
for leadership positions.

929
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I haven't been

930
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
in the market for 10 years.

931
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Then I moved

932
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
to a business position

933
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and then I managed

934
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
to get a market

935
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
compensation.

936
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's almost

937
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
very difficult to be in the military

938
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
for 10 years and still

939
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
get a market compensation.

940
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We had a case

941
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and it turned out that

942
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
there is a lack of knowledge.

943
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You can do a lot

944
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
in what you've been doing

945
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
for 10 years.

946
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You change things.

947
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Then you move to another company

948
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and you are not as flexible

949
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
when it comes to technology

950
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and products.

951
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It wasn't enough.

952
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You are culturally

953
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
very balanced in one field

954
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
after 10 years.

955
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's best 10 times in one

956
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
than once in 10.

957
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You are in an open zone.

958
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Of course,

959
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
there are other criteria.

960
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You will be here for a long time.

961
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That's good.

962
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I see that

963
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
here you are always

964
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
building a team

965
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
or as a recruiter.

966
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
There are some differences.

967
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
There is a difference

968
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
between 7 years of experience

969
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
and 7 times in one year.

970
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
But is it possible

971
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
to have one year of experience

972
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
even better than 7 years?

973
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It depends on the context.

974
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I think that

975
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
one year

976
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
is extreme.

977
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But I think that

978
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Slovenia doesn't understand it.

979
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's a sign

980
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
as I hear

981
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
from my contacts

982
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
that there is something wrong with the candidate.

983
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Absolutely.

984
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
As you said,

985
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
job hopping

986
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I can understand it

987
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
in a candidate-driven market.

988
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
When you are interested

989
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
in a skill set

990
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and you get a new offer

991
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
every week in an inbox.

992
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You find a better project

993
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and it doesn't work

994
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
on its own.

995
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
On the other hand,

996
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
you let it go.

997
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's a great way

998
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
to optimize for a higher salary.

999
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
If you optimize for an expert,

1000
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
it's hard to work

1001
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
if you only have one year.

1002
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I would like to change the perception.

1003
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I have been working

1004
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
for 60-70 different companies

1005
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
for 10 years.

1006
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
When I applied

1007
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
for a regular job,

1008
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I said that I was a freelancer

1009
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and I had my own agency.

1010
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
The more contracts I have,

1011
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
the lower my value.

1012
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I know how to impose

1013
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
FDV.

1014
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I try to adapt my situation

1015
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
to a variety of experiences.

1016
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
If I write

1017
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
that I was here for half a year

1018
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and here for 3 months

1019
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and here I am hiding

1020
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
because I worked in 3 projects

1021
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
for a short time,

1022
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I think it's also

1023
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
because

1024
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
in the end,

1025
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
IT is a very complicated thing

1026
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
where you have a portfolio

1027
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and some references.

1028
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Those who are

1029
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
at the top

1030
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
have a lot of unrelated

1031
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
services.

1032
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
They have startups,

1033
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
hobby projects that can develop

1034
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
or not.

1035
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And now we will have

1036
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
an experience where

1037
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
they value engineering

1038
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
in a positive way.

1039
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
That you are not a one-trick pony.

1040
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Absolutely.

1041
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
When it comes to profiles,

1042
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
we see hundreds

1043
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
of recruiters.

1044
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Življen wrote weekly,

1045
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
then also daily,

1046
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
but weekly.

1047
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
There are some patterns.

1048
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You see that

1049
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
engineers who are

1050
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
perhaps the most successful,

1051
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
there is a difference

1052
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
between 100 and 200 engineers,

1053
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
there is a difference.

1054
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You see a lot of different things.

1055
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
But it's not just

1056
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
different companies,

1057
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
but really different

1058
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
industries, different stacks,

1059
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
different products,

1060
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
consultants, agencies

1061
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and product companies,

1062
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
startups and big

1063
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
legacy companies.

1064
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
When you see more different things,

1065
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
you are more

1066
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
realistically T-shaped.

1067
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It seems to me that

1068
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
at the beginning of your career,

1069
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
in the first 10 years,

1070
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
it is obvious that you change

1071
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and you see a lot of things.

1072
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I have an experience

1073
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
with mentoring and people

1074
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
who perform.

1075
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
What you are trying to look for

1076
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
is an organization or environment

1077
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
in which you can grow.

1078
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
There are not many of them.

1079
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I think that at the beginning

1080
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
you will suffer a low salary

1081
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
if you have a feeling that you are developing.

1082
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Because this development will

1083
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
happen to you in some time.

1084
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
The alternative is to fall

1085
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
into a company that can pay well,

1086
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
but then you stagnate

1087
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
for years.

1088
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
If you change the service so much,

1089
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
you become competitive

1090
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
because you have not learned

1091
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
anything useful.

1092
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Because you become an expert

1093
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
in your own system.

1094
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I had a situation

1095
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
where I applied for a front-end developer

1096
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and I did not know JavaScript.

1097
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
He told me that this person

1098
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
had 4 hours of Bruto

1099
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
3 years ago, before Corona,

1100
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
which is a very high salary.

1101
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But there was one person in Slovenia

1102
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
who is a custom CMS

1103
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
developed by an agency.

1104
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I told him to stay here

1105
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
because no other company

1106
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
will give you this salary

1107
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
for front-end developer.

1108
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,800
And that is one of the reasons.

1109
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:10,800
And I said, look, ride it out, but know that you will have a challenge if you don't know that.

1110
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:20,799
And in the end, he still paid me well, he was at a certain level, but at the end of the service, it will be a little more painful.

1111
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:33,599
It's a little, well, here it's a little, no, well, there is a menu, but as you said, if you find a good engineering culture,

1112
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,599
then you will spend the next two to three years, because you can go there on that dip.

1113
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,599
But I also face this question a lot, what is a good business, what is a good engineering culture.

1114
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
I have two opinions on the recipe.

1115
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Now I don't know if you agree with me or not, but I think it's true that you always optimize,

1116
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:02,400
or if you already choose and you don't have a lot of choices, you prioritize companies that make a living from selling their software.

1117
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:14,400
This means that their main source of income is software and not gasoline, or I don't know, something else, but business software.

1118
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:19,199
You have to approach the production of a product in a very different way.

1119
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,199
Is engineering a profit center or a cost center?

1120
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:23,199
That's right.

1121
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,199
In my world, it's a bit like that.

1122
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,199
Services are partners, you have to try more to know what you like.

1123
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:41,199
I somehow follow this in the world, you don't really know what a good service and a bad service are if you have one.

1124
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:50,000
A lot has already happened to me, I thought it was the best, then I changed it and two years later I'm preparing it.

1125
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They write that it was toxic, you didn't satisfy and I don't know what else.

1126
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But when you're in there, you have a different view of what you don't know.

1127
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
After ten years and sixty accidents, I gave up.

1128
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
Now I'm a bit old-fashioned.

1129
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,800
When I'm older, I'm a bit more lost, I don't sleep well.

1130
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,800
You get a perception when you're at the factory, you know, you're accused of a crime,

1131
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,800
and then you realize that people work 10-12 hours a day and they're proud of it.

1132
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,800
And you're like, okay, I've been there a hundred times, I know how it ends.

1133
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,600
This is definitely one of the stresses of organization of work.

1134
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,600
But I think it's very interesting.

1135
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,600
The engineering culture or the process of development,

1136
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,600
where the software development life cycle is as transparent as possible,

1137
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,600
so you can really see how things start and how they go into production,

1138
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,600
and what happens later.

1139
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:58,399
That's one thing, that the software development life cycle is transparent

1140
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:00,399
and that it values your brain, not your hands.

1141
00:53:00,399 --> 00:53:02,399
That's the best.

1142
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:04,399
I'm still a bit skeptical.

1143
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:06,399
Maybe I'll tell you later.

1144
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:10,399
And one year? Really, not one year?

1145
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:12,399
No, no, no.

1146
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,399
Slovenian companies don't have such good onboarding systems.

1147
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,399
No, absolutely not.

1148
00:53:16,399 --> 00:53:18,399
So that you can really go and start working.

1149
00:53:18,399 --> 00:53:22,399
Slovenian companies are not prepared to replace candidates in one year

1150
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,199
and one year really perform fully.

1151
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,199
I think everyone here ...

1152
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,199
I agree completely.

1153
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:31,199
If you're a junior, three years.

1154
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,199
If you're a senior, maybe a year and a half.

1155
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:35,199
And then a year if you're really out.

1156
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,199
Yes.

1157
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,199
I would say that if the engineering culture is bad,

1158
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,199
change it in one year if you find a better one.

1159
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:43,199
In three months.

1160
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,199
If it's good, stay two to three years.

1161
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:47,199
Absolutely.

1162
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,199
I think it's a better digger.

1163
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:51,199
For example, in the first seven to ten years,

1164
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
you can replace more than five companies.

1165
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Something like that.

1166
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
If you're a regular employee.

1167
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If you're a regular employee.

1168
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
If you replace more than five companies in ten years,

1169
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
it's already a bit of a red flag.

1170
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You can have a good argument why you did it.

1171
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Because they will ask you.

1172
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
That's it.

1173
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'm really not completely against it.

1174
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
If you're not good, if you don't learn anything new,

1175
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
change it anyway.

1176
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But I think it's an indicator.

1177
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I will not say any relationship,

1178
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,799
but it is in existence.

1179
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:24,799
You put it very well.

1180
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,799
I would also like to share

1181
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:28,799
this onboarding.

1182
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,799
Because it seems to me that

1183
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:32,799
Slovenian companies

1184
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:34,799
have a chance to improve

1185
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:36,799
when we talk

1186
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,799
at a very senior level.

1187
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,799
You want a samurai

1188
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,799
and someone

1189
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,799
who will really change

1190
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,799
things in the company.

1191
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,799
Then he comes to you

1192
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
and you shake his hand.

1193
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
The first thing.

1194
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
You shake his hand and say,

1195
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
it's okay,

1196
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
here's a year of onboarding

1197
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
so you can get to know each other a little.

1198
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
Then it comes

1199
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
the trust.

1200
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,600
That maybe you know everything

1201
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,600
and you're in the top

1202
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
paid company.

1203
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
I think these companies

1204
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
know faster

1205
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,600
what your superpower is

1206
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,399
and you let your superpower

1207
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:22,399
to them as soon as possible.

1208
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,399
Is that just a stereotype

1209
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:26,399
from my side?

1210
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:28,399
Or how do you see it?

1211
00:55:28,399 --> 00:55:30,399
I think we have a problem

1212
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:32,399
in Slovenia with the culture

1213
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,399
when we come to a more leadership position.

1214
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,399
Onboarding and recruiting

1215
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,399
for juniors

1216
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,399
and for mid-levels

1217
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:42,399
is even more difficult

1218
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:44,399
because there are

1219
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:46,399
very few opportunities.

1220
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
It's more difficult

1221
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
to get that knowledge

1222
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
and I would say

1223
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
that when a leadership position comes

1224
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
to a company,

1225
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
it's usually when there's a crisis

1226
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
and there are fires

1227
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
and you need to do something.

1228
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
That's why they hire you.

1229
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,200
I think it's difficult

1230
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
in a bad leadership culture

1231
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
in general

1232
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
because

1233
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
we talk too little

1234
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
about these things

1235
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
because we have so few opportunities

1236
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
in general

1237
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
how the organization is set up

1238
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
how it's organized

1239
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
how the teams are structured

1240
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
we don't talk about these things

1241
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
in the sense of whether you have engineers in the team

1242
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
whether you have a product team

1243
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
or what is the composition

1244
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and that has a big impact

1245
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
on the whole onboarding

1246
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
because if you only need one year

1247
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
to figure out

1248
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
there's no problem in onboarding

1249
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the problem is in the food.

1250
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
In my experience

1251
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I think that

1252
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
in Slovenia

1253
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
all companies will say

1254
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
that they exist

1255
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and that they have all the necessary documents

1256
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and you go through it

1257
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and you don't know where to start.

1258
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
That's my experience

1259
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm a bit triggered

1260
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and maybe you can see

1261
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
that I've been through a couple of such stories.

1262
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You are also

1263
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
starting a business

1264
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
with onboarding

1265
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
because there's a fee

1266
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
or a guarantee

1267
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
that you give to the candidate

1268
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
if they pass the exam

1269
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and then you invest in onboarding.

1270
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
What are the trends

1271
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
from your point of view?

1272
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
We are prepared

1273
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
when we talk about

1274
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
collaborating with companies

1275
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
that have very little experience

1276
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
and we had a case

1277
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
that we are still recruiting for

1278
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
where they hired 10 people in the last two years

1279
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and out of those 10 people

1280
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
only one was hired in two years.

1281
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And then

1282
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
we got

1283
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
four positions

1284
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and we started to think

1285
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
what's going on

1286
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
what's the problem

1287
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
is it the people you hired

1288
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
that weren't right

1289
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
or is it the problem in the way

1290
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
that they didn't

1291
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
work for the recruiters

1292
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
because they are

1293
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
not well-known in Slovenia

1294
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
they are super international

1295
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
they got bad reviews

1296
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and they took the ones they could

1297
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
so we found them

1298
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
hired people

1299
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
but we were a bit scared

1300
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
what if we let them go

1301
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
and we decided

1302
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
that we are going to

1303
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
start onboarding

1304
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
so we were

1305
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
a bit scared

1306
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
did we give them a tool

1307
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
even though the first six months

1308
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
were exhausting

1309
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
working with people

1310
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
because in any case

1311
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
you are on a project

1312
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
you have your priorities

1313
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
how much time do you have

1314
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
even if you are a mentor

1315
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
how much time do you have

1316
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and those people are juniors

1317
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
at the beginning

1318
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
we realized that

1319
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
there are companies

1320
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that do it very well

1321
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and there are companies

1322
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
that you come to

1323
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and you don't fall in the water

1324
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
or you swim

1325
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
we are interested

1326
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
if we hire a candidate

1327
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
to hold on for a long time

1328
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
not only in the time

1329
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
of the guarantee

1330
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
which is so many months

1331
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
so we recognize

1332
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
that there is something missing

1333
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
in smaller companies

1334
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
because they don't have time

1335
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
to deal with it

1336
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and they don't have tools

1337
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
to help them

1338
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
once you were in a company

1339
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
onboarding went through

1340
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
two years went by

1341
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
first year

1342
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
honeymoon period

1343
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
everything was great

1344
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
second year

1345
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
you have a sexier company

1346
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and you look at your net pay

1347
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
and you get your net salary

1348
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
when is it easiest

1349
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
to pay

1350
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and

1351
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
how to

1352
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
protect

1353
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
a position in a company

1354
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
but you have to pay

1355
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
to stay competitive

1356
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
do we have a world

1357
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
for all those who

1358
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
worked hard

1359
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
but

1360
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
what are the opportunities

1361
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
for higher pay

1362
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
once you work in a company

1363
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
just like you did with a domestic tax

1364
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
the day before you ask

1365
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
for a higher salary

1366
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
6 months ago you asked

1367
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
hypothetically

1368
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
if someone wanted a higher salary

1369
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
what could they do

1370
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you tell your boss

1371
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
you talk about some goals

1372
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and then you work

1373
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
to satisfy those goals

1374
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
get new competences

1375
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
or whatever

1376
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
and then you put

1377
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
your effort into action

1378
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and you are ready

1379
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
that's it

1380
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
a lot of times

1381
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
in my experience

1382
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
why don't they give a raise

1383
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
to people who are already employed

1384
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
until they ask

1385
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
just that simple

1386
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
just ask

1387
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
ok, first step

1388
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
ask

1389
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and then they say

1390
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I don't have a budget

1391
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
and if I don't have a budget

1392
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I won't pay new people

1393
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and then you know

1394
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
if you have a budget

1395
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
and you don't want to give it

1396
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
you know where you are

1397
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
and it's a different kind of conversation

1398
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
but you always have to ask

1399
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
what are your goals

1400
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
most companies start

1401
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
hiring once or twice a year

1402
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
we will hire for inflation

1403
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
we will hire for that

1404
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
those are things you have to

1405
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
be prepared for

1406
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
and you have to talk about

1407
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that shouldn't be a topic

1408
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
your compensation is part of your job

1409
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
and if you are afraid to ask

1410
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I would think about it

1411
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
because

1412
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
if you don't ask, you won't get it

1413
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
it doesn't mean

1414
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
you won't get it

1415
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
but it's just a step

1416
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
do you pay attention to

1417
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
a lot of candidates

1418
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
who hire you

1419
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
to get a raise

1420
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
yes, it happens

1421
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
quite often

1422
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
for example

1423
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
we give them a better opportunity

1424
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
a better pay

1425
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
they are not satisfied

1426
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
but once they decide to go

1427
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
you have to be patient

1428
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
you push them a little

1429
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
because you know them well

1430
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
and you have to be patient

1431
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
so you have to repeat

1432
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
when they decide to go

1433
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
you have to pay attention

1434
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
so I would say

1435
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
if you are

1436
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
if you are satisfied

1437
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
but you just have to pay

1438
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
one thing is to ask

1439
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
the other is

1440
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
you can say

1441
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I think I have a low salary

1442
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I think I would pay a little

1443
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and again, it's enough

1444
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
if you know

1445
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
you have a domestic task

1446
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and the domestic task is

1447
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
if you are lucky

1448
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
look around

1449
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and try to get a value

1450
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
you don't have to react to it

1451
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but it's an ease of mind

1452
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the service for hiring

1453
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
is not a fixed time

1454
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
you won't be prepared

1455
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
for some options

1456
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
that's it

1457
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I think

1458
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
the hardest

1459
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
is to know the context

1460
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and

1461
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I know

1462
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
we go to recruiters

1463
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and then you go

1464
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
you didn't want to go to another service

1465
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
but you had to tell the boss

1466
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
it's a little more serious

1467
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
than we talked

1468
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
it's nice when you mentioned

1469
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
it's a good product

1470
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
it's nice when you are prepared

1471
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
for the story

1472
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
what did you do

1473
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
what did you learn

1474
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
what did you contribute

1475
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
just to say

1476
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I think I have a low salary

1477
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
so I would deserve more

1478
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
or he has more

1479
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
you have to be careful

1480
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
what you wish for

1481
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
you can wish too much

1482
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
can someone

1483
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
say

1484
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
we don't play in this league

1485
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
for such compensation

1486
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
we all agreed

1487
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
you have a low culture fit

1488
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and

1489
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
you can be worried

1490
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
that if you can't

1491
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
offer compensation

1492
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
that you know

1493
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
it's too late

1494
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
too late

1495
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
for the person

1496
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
who will ask for more compensation

1497
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
in two years

1498
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
we don't have to increase

1499
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the compensation

1500
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
we are prepared to invest

1501
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and risk

1502
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
it's very likely

1503
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
that the person will fly

1504
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
it's related to a culture fit

1505
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
where you try to understand

1506
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
why the person is looking for a job

1507
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
6 months without a job

1508
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
desperate

1509
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
not satisfied with our compensation

1510
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
but will take it

1511
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and you will find someone else

1512
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I see it this way

1513
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
you always try

1514
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
to match your expectations

1515
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
to what you are looking for

1516
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
there are levels

1517
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
there are budgets

1518
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and if you are off

1519
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
hiring manager can win

1520
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
we have to change the crypto

1521
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
we have to change the crypto bubble

1522
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
with a song

1523
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
because

1524
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
there are engineers

1525
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
who managed

1526
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
to reach a compensation

1527
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
that was simply unimaginable

1528
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
because it was

1529
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
a lot of free crypto money

1530
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and then

1531
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
there was a lot of disappointment

1532
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
when you had to leave

1533
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I had a situation

1534
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
when someone came and said

1535
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I want 7000 brutes per month

1536
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and the question was why

1537
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
because I come from Great Britain

1538
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
and it starts there

1539
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
once in a lifetime opportunity

1540
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I am very happy

1541
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
that you liked it

1542
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
but

1543
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
the reality

1544
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
99% of other cases

1545
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
we don't talk about those numbers

1546
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and now it is

1547
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
a bad recognition

1548
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
or you will go back to crypto

1549
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and try again

1550
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
or you will agree

1551
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
that if you earn 4000 brutes

1552
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
you are a top 1% earner

1553
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
that is the reality

1554
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I don't know what to say

1555
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
if you are the first one to say

1556
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
in a paid conversation

1557
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
and it is so high

1558
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
that you take away the opportunity

1559
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
and it is better to wait

1560
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
for your children to say

1561
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
this was a question

1562
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
on this topic

1563
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and it is interesting

1564
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
these are just some basics

1565
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
is it a stereotype

1566
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
that it is very important

1567
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
to be the first one to pay

1568
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and is it or not

1569
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
how do you see it

1570
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
my problem is

1571
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
that

1572
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
sometimes I exceed

1573
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
most of the budget

1574
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and I won't have 6 interviews

1575
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
in 4 months

1576
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
and I say

1577
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
thank you

1578
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
but

1579
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
if you don't exceed the budget

1580
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
it is good

1581
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that you have a good idea

1582
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
of what you want

1583
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
you have to know what you want

1584
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
you don't have to say it

1585
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
but you have to know

1586
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
what are your expectations

1587
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and if you don't have expectations

1588
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
don't go crazy

1589
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
because you won't know

1590
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
what you want

1591
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
it depends on the context

1592
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and it is important

1593
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
to have a response

1594
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
because it depends on the subject

1595
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
on the seniority

1596
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
and if you already know

1597
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
what you want

1598
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
it is much easier

1599
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
to move forward

1600
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
if not

1601
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I think

1602
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
it is best to be realistic

1603
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
you won't get 30%

1604
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
more money

1605
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
but

1606
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
there are possibilities

1607
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
be realistic

1608
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
say what are your expectations

1609
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
one principle

1610
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
is to say

1611
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
what do we pay now

1612
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
and you expect so much more

1613
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
another principle

1614
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
is also

1615
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I recently received

1616
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
from a professor

1617
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
very interesting

1618
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
MBA

1619
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
what do you pay

1620
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
how much do you say

1621
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
first of all

1622
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
you say a very high number

1623
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
that means

1624
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
for this position

1625
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I predict that you pay

1626
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
as much as you can

1627
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
psychologically

1628
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
a very high amount

1629
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
and then

1630
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
ok

1631
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
now I look at my experience

1632
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and seniority

1633
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
so

1634
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
you have your minimum

1635
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
and maximum

1636
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
and your salary is not your maximum

1637
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
but it is chaos for this position

1638
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
so you psychologically

1639
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
give them an idea

1640
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
that they give you more

1641
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
than your minimum

1642
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I don't know

1643
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
you can always make a domestic tax

1644
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
yes

1645
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
every company for the same tax

1646
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
will have different budgets

1647
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
and if you will

1648
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
come to two different companies

1649
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
you didn't make a domestic tax

1650
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
you have to be interested

1651
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
either through voice

1652
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
what are your budgets

1653
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
or you try to pay

1654
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
through LinkedIn for jobs

1655
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
or whatever

1656
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
first of all

1657
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
we don't talk about paying

1658
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
we talk about paying

1659
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and these are issues

1660
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
that are not a taboo

1661
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
if something is recorded

1662
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
or not recorded

1663
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
but recorded

1664
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
so let's make a domestic tax

1665
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I don't have an experience

1666
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
that if a range is announced

1667
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
that everyone comes

1668
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
and wants the highest salary

1669
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I think it is true

1670
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
that we break the stereotype

1671
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
that companies have

1672
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
if I write

1673
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
that everyone wants the highest

1674
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and my employees will come

1675
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I don't have such experiences

1676
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
on the other hand

1677
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I also have an experience

1678
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
that there is always a range

1679
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
after the range

1680
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
as you said

1681
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
everything happens

1682
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
that if there is a range

1683
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
for the right skillset

1684
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
it is not there

1685
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
what happens a lot

1686
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
is that you come

1687
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
to a workplace

1688
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and you think

1689
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
that it would be better

1690
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
for something else

1691
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
that we haven't opened yet

1692
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
there we can talk

1693
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and there are different interviews

1694
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and there is a new job

1695
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and a lot of times

1696
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
a new job opens

1697
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
because if you get

1698
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
a super old guy

1699
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
you won't give him

1700
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
a clean slate

1701
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and a lot of times

1702
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
when the right person came

1703
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
everything changed

1704
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
and the leaders

1705
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
changed

1706
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
that was my experience

1707
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
it happens

1708
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
but we can't say

1709
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
that it is a rule

1710
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
because in some cases

1711
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
the politics is very strict

1712
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
they look at the salary

1713
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
they look at the situation

1714
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
for the last night

1715
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
it is different in other cases

1716
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
what is the salary

1717
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
in a clean workplace

1718
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
is it a lot?

1719
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I would say that it is not a practice

1720
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
it is not a practice

1721
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
but still

1722
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
there are some

1723
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
roles

1724
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
with a range

1725
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and it is hard

1726
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
to go beyond that

1727
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
but it is not

1728
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
like it would be

1729
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
publicly known

1730
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
what is the salary

1731
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
even in IT

1732
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I don't know if you know

1733
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
it is too many jobs

1734
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
three times

1735
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
a product job

1736
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
an engineer

1737
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
a basic job

1738
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
there can be a big difference

1739
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
in salaries

1740
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
between sales and IT

1741
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
sales salary is very low

1742
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
because it is related to

1743
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
compensation

1744
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
then it depends

1745
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
if it is a yes or no

1746
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
maybe

1747
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
sales is not so much

1748
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
because it can be

1749
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
very good

1750
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
compensation

1751
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
support functions, accounting

1752
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
marketing

1753
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
there are standards

1754
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
customer support

1755
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
there are standards

1756
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
we all need to know

1757
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
that engineering salaries

1758
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
are above average

1759
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
absolutely

1760
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
this is also

1761
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
my experience

1762
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
that Slovenian engineers

1763
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
are more conservative

1764
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
than I said before

1765
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I have to work three times more

1766
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
especially because

1767
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
they get along with others

1768
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and engineering salaries

1769
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
are above average

1770
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I agree

1771
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
it is so rare

1772
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
to get a job

1773
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
in a software company

1774
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
in Slovenia

1775
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
we don't have much to do

1776
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
we get bonuses

1777
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
we get a good salary

1778
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
we have a good

1779
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
reputation

1780
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
and a good personality

1781
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
we don't complain

1782
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
it is not a bad thing

1783
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
it is nice

1784
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
that if you work

1785
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
somewhere else

1786
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
you don't realize

1787
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
that you are privileged

1788
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
this is my intention

1789
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,200
We are all privileged, not only IT people, but we need to maintain some kind of relativeness.

1790
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:10,200
We are nearing the end, so I will only ask one last question.

1791
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:16,200
It is a big one, but it will also be a guide for the next episodes.

1792
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:21,200
You touched on this a little bit, so maybe we can conclude with this.

1793
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:27,200
In addition to the salary, maybe there is no space, no budget for a higher salary.

1794
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,200
Maybe this is not achievable.

1795
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,200
What are the other things besides the salary, which can be more successful,

1796
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:43,200
or which are often used by companies for, as you said, compensation, not just salary?

1797
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,200
One thing we often forget is the allowance.

1798
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:52,200
You can always say 5 more days.

1799
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:58,200
If this is still your compensation, if you say for 20 more days an additional month,

1800
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,200
which is almost 10% higher salary,

1801
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:06,199
and of course some things that are not related to finance,

1802
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:13,199
such as a car service or something similar,

1803
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:18,199
which is more contextual, are things that you can talk about.

1804
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:23,199
For companies it is easier because they have a budget for salary.

1805
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:28,199
These things come from other budgets, education budget, etc.

1806
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:34,199
You can always ask, you can talk.

1807
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:37,199
The question is, what does it consist of?

1808
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,199
And then they ask themselves on the basis of this,

1809
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:43,199
what is the space available for me?

1810
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,199
Some things go against you, some don't.

1811
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,199
These are all my experiences.

1812
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:51,199
In addition to bonuses and salaries,

1813
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:56,199
this is not so widespread in Slovenia now, in my opinion.

1814
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,199
Did I forget something?

1815
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:00,199
Yes, maybe that.

1816
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,199
Sometimes it is not necessary to have a high salary,

1817
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,199
but let's say a company offers 13-14 salaries,

1818
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:08,199
a reward for success,

1819
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:10,199
and you have a plan at the end,

1820
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:12,199
I don't know, 5 salaries can be more,

1821
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:14,199
but if you don't ask, you won't know.

1822
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:17,199
So it's also nice that maybe you start asking for a salary

1823
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,199
before you increase the amount,

1824
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,199
but what are the other benefits?

1825
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,199
Do you see a lot of this in the Slovenian market,

1826
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:28,199
that companies try to be more competitive with other things,

1827
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:32,199
which benefits more than just business?

1828
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:35,199
And is the candidate a business person?

1829
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,199
I mean, has anyone ever replaced a company

1830
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:41,199
because of ping-pong and good writers?

1831
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,199
Or not at all?

1832
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:46,199
It depends on how dissatisfied he was.

1833
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:49,199
A lot of candidates who are very dissatisfied

1834
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,199
will also go for less,

1835
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,199
I think it's because of the full practice,

1836
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,199
but it will also go for a little less,

1837
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,199
and maybe for a little less stressful job,

1838
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,199
maybe for a better performance,

1839
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,199
I don't know, the benefits they will have.

1840
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,199
So these things happen too.

1841
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,199
I think that a lot of engineers and programmers are like that,

1842
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:08,199
when they come to a level

1843
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:11,199
where 500 euros more or less is not as important as

1844
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,199
what kind of challenge they have,

1845
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,199
what kind of team they have,

1846
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,199
how they can develop in the future.

1847
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:20,199
So different things happen.

1848
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,199
A good indicator of these benefits

1849
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:24,199
is the culture of the business,

1850
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,199
what gives value.

1851
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:28,199
I have a card for fitness, badminton,

1852
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:30,199
I don't know what else.

1853
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:32,199
It's not badminton,

1854
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:34,199
but the card that makes the difference,

1855
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:36,199
but it gives you a feeling

1856
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:38,199
that they value you as a person,

1857
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,199
in their head,

1858
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:42,199
in a physical sense.

1859
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,199
I have the feeling that a lot of companies

1860
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:48,199
that can't compete with pay

1861
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,199
compete with that culture.

1862
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:52,199
Holistically.

1863
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,199
We have, I don't know,

1864
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,199
God,

1865
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:00,199
as funny as it sounds,

1866
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:02,199
businesses that have God

1867
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:04,199
let you know that these are family businesses,

1868
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,199
and if you have children in your head,

1869
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,199
it won't be that bad.

1870
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:10,199
And those who have children,

1871
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:12,199
God is an indicator

1872
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:14,199
that maybe you will feel better here,

1873
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:16,200
because if my child is sick,

1874
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,200
nobody will live for me,

1875
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,200
because he has children and understands.

1876
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,200
So I would say these are indicators,

1877
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,200
that they have a culture,

1878
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,200
value, and maybe something else,

1879
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,200
because you work from 8 to 4,

1880
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,200
as much as possible,

1881
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,200
make money, make money,

1882
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200
but there are other tasks.

1883
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,200
Or time,

1884
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,200
that's a good shout-out.

1885
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,200
I think that time is

1886
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
extremely valuable,

1887
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,200
and a lot of engineers

1888
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,200
from my experience

1889
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,200
are prepared to work

1890
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,200
for a lot less than 4 days a week,

1891
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,200
for example.

1892
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,200
There are others

1893
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,200
who only pay at the end,

1894
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,200
but

1895
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,200
are we already in Slovenia,

1896
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,200
did we conquer it,

1897
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,200
do we have a nice competitive

1898
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,200
benefit and profit

1899
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,200
in Slovenian businesses,

1900
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,200
or is it still a little

1901
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,200
connected to culture?

1902
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
I think there is more to it.

1903
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,200
When Corona came,

1904
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,200
we had competitors,

1905
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
and in one year

1906
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
a lot of things happened.

1907
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
Cups are no longer

1908
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,200
rare, but we all have cups now.

1909
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,200
So for me,

1910
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,200
the pressure that came

1911
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,200
from Zuni for the Slovenian frame,

1912
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,200
some Slovenian companies

1913
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,200
were a little scared.

1914
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
So I'm not saying that it's

1915
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
very good now and that everyone is there,

1916
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,200
but I personally see a lot of progress

1917
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,200
in the last 2-3 years.

1918
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,200
We also let ourselves be trampled,

1919
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,200
we know that the law has changed.

1920
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,200
This is a big indicator

1921
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
that your presence is not important,

1922
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,200
your output or outcome is important,

1923
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
and this is a big shift

1924
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
in the mentality that

1925
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
maybe 5-10 years

1926
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
is not as widespread as it is today.

1927
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
So that's my opinion.

1928
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,200
I'm pretty happy today.

1929
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,200
I was also here 4 years ago,

1930
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
but today I'm a little happier.

1931
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
I think that

1932
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
when we talked about

1933
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,200
how much the need for IT staff has increased,

1934
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
all the companies could adapt a little.

1935
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,200
Also working

1936
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
on employer branding,

1937
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,200
to hear the stories

1938
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,200
how well they are doing.

1939
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
We also have a very small company,

1940
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,200
I don't know them at all,

1941
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,200
but I'm worried about the employees.

1942
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Once again, I can say that

1943
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,200
the names that are promoted

1944
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,200
with it. So in practice,

1945
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,200
the companies have made a lot of progress.

1946
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,200
Thank you.

1947
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,200
You're welcome.

1948
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,200
It seems to me that it was

1949
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,200
a great conversation.

1950
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,200
I'll give you a little more time

1951
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,200
for some closing thoughts,

1952
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,200
if you want.

1953
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,200
Miha, maybe

1954
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,200
we'll start with you.

1955
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,200
We are always a little paid.

1956
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,200
If you work,

1957
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,200
you always pay too much.

1958
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,200
Let's talk.

1959
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,200
First of all,

1960
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,200
we won't talk about a taboo topic,

1961
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,200
but let's talk about it

1962
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,200
with some context and

1963
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,200
importance, because

1964
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,200
there is a lot of talk about it in Slovenia.

1965
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,200
We always

1966
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,200
talk about how much you pay.

1967
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,200
Maybe one more reply

1968
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,200
from my side.

1969
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,200
Don't fall asleep.

1970
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Don't be 10 years in one company.

1971
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,200
Look here,

1972
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,200
what can you develop?

1973
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,200
Tell us what

1974
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,200
doesn't suit you.

1975
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
If you think you have a change,

1976
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,200
go talk to a recruiter.

1977
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,200
I'm kidding.

1978
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,200
If you can,

1979
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,200
don't turn away.

1980
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,200
We'll tell you in a light way.

1981
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,200
Definitely,

1982
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,200
don't fall asleep.

1983
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,200
In fact, every employee is

1984
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,200
responsible for his or her career.

1985
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,200
If you leave it to others and

1986
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,200
don't take care of your career,

1987
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,200
we'll get in trouble.

1988
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,200
We've covered it to the end.

1989
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,200
Thank you for joining me.

1990
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,200

which is also

1996
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,200
in a collection of Slovenian companies

1997
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,200
in the IT space.

1998
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,200
So,

1999
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,200
thank you very much

2000
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,200
once again for this interview.

2001
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,200
And of course,

2002

2004
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,200
to leave us some feedback,

2005
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,200
follow-up questions,

2006
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,200
and we'll try

2007
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,200
to answer them

2008
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,200
in the next episodes.

2009
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,200
So,

2010
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,200
one more baby under the train

2011
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,200
to wrap up.

2012
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,200
Have a nice evening.

2013
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,200
Thank you.
