00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, Erik, to a new episode of Ogrodje, especially about fairy tales.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
These are our episodes that are short and effective and have a common theme.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I greet you once again in Ogrodje.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This episode is conceived as an episode where we will launch the Slovenia AI meetup,

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
where you will also be teaching today.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A few weeks ago, I followed your product SpyDelta on the Slovenian Developer Group.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I saw that you decided to work in the public sector.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's right.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's better than working in the public sector?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Introduce yourself and tell us who you are and what you do.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My name is Erik, I'm an electronics engineer.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've been programming professionally for the last few years.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've been working on SpyDelta for the last four months.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You've been developing it for four months?

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's right.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's been a pleasure.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The title of your today's lecture, as well as your post, is

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Product for Competitive Analysis.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Competitive Analysis.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, Competitive Analysis is a Slovenian translation.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You published a link to ProductHunt.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a website where you list your products,

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
where people give rankings and look for the most innovative products.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I went to take a look at it, I saw some comments below,

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and I said, OK, I have to try it.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then I forgot about it, like everyone else.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then we agreed that we would have this today's lecture.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I wrote to you and said, Erik, give me some demo access to try it out.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And you said, it's not even a UI.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's just an email.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Your product at this stage, when we're talking now,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
looks like you're going to the website,

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you write your email in there,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and then you write a split page

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
in which you would like to do a competitive analysis of the news.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's right.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Those are two inputs, and then you wait.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In a few minutes you get an email report.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I printed it out here.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's a very impressive analysis of competition.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't have to say exactly what I put in there,

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
but it's a company I work for.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a Fortune 100 company.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I put it in there and it said,

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the price went up in July,

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the products were launched,

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the products were sold,

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
they found some connections in the menu,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
they saw I was a stockholder, they were very happy.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was really surprised, like, wow, something is really happening here.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a one-pager, an A4 sheet,

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and I was very surprised.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We started recording this conversation the day before,

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I went to try it again, and it didn't work.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So I decided to go for the free tier.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
For me, it's just one domain.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In the future, I plan to integrate Stripe with paid customers,

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a kind of freemium model,

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so I can monitor more different domains,

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
more different components.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Before we move on to the solution,

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
can you tell us how you came up with this problem?

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is it your personal experience, or is it something you're interested in?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
With the previous company,

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I tried a few existing tools,

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and I realized they were either enterprise-grade,

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
like RCS, which I learned to use,

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
or technologically not optimal.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For example, they make screenshots and then try them on.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then I thought, I can make a better product with AI in two weeks,

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and send me only the useful stuff by e-mail.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
For example, if you have a heavy video,

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the product that's on the bottom of the screenshot

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
will send you an e-mail with a different frame on the video.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, okay, okay.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It wasn't optimal.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
When you published the blog post I mentioned,

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
a sketch was drawn.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I redrew it, so we have an architecture overview.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But tell us more about the components that make up this system.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm treating it like it's not a full secret,

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but I'm interested if you can tell us

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
what the main components of this system are.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I published a sketch of the entire business stack,

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
both technically and for e-mail hosting.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I described the entire cost of this project.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
For e-mail hosting, I used Zoho,

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
which is a platform for five users.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I wanted to show that you can start with $10 a month,

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and you can already have a live project.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We have Cloudflare,

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think you used JavaScript Worker for e-mail hosting.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm not sure about that.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, I used Cloudflare for back-end,

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for sign-ups, and for landing pages.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then I used the Hetzner server,

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
for e-mail scrapping and analysis.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Back-end is on Hetzner.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I saw that it's an instance,

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it costs $5 or something like that.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hetzner is what you can afford.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then, in this flow,

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the core AI logic is divided into

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
data collection,

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and then translation of the results.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Am I interpreting this correctly?

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
LLM is used on larger workflows.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How does it work?

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
First, the website is scrapped,

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
multiple times, you have different snapshots,

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and then it looks at what has changed in the last month.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Then it looks at the markdown diff,

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and then uses LLM for insight extraction.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
M-section, on the front-end,

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
goes from the top of the page to the bottom of the page.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not as useful,

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because the company launched a new feature,

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
or a new product, or the pricing changed.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
One aspect of this is insight extraction

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
from the diff on the webpage.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Do you also look at the front-end right now?

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I saw in your sketches that you also go to the web archive.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I use this a lot.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you sign up,

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you will first look at the archive,

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to get a summary of what it looked like a year ago.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You will directly get a report

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
on what has changed in the last 12 months

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
on the website.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You will look at the landing page,

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
what it used to look like,

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and what it looks like now.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You will look at the links,

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
which links used to be from the landing page,

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and which ones are now.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Based on this, you will decide

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
which sites you want to cover,

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
which know how to have business insight.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What you just described,

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
all the requirements,

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is this expressed through a programmed flow?

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is this a prompt?

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Or is it a combination?

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's a combination.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because it seems to me that it's a complex logic.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes, it is.

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
First, you will try to get a landing page from 12 months ago,

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
then you will look at the changes,

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
for example, which are the new sites,

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
or pages, or deleted pages.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then you will use LLM,

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
so that it will decide

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
which are the sites you want to look at.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You will look at them,

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you will summarize them,

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and then at the end you will do a summarization,

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so that you will get a simple report

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
in an A4 format,

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
10 bullet points,

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but the most important things that have changed.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Excellent.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
When you send an email,

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I saw that in the email footer,

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
it also connects to,

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
how do you say,

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a prompt that was used to generate an email.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, a full prompt.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, a full prompt,

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and you click on it,

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and then it will write to you,

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
what was the prompt with which the email was sent,

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
that you see it done.

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That seemed like a very technical detail to me,

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
but it was like,

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
oh wow, ok,

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that was definitely processed.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is now the prompt engineering,

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
how to make the best system prompt,

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
so that you get the email only from the user,

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and now,

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
do I have the best system prompt or not?

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Maybe someone will write a better one,

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and then maybe they will say,

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
hey, maybe I should use this,

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
or I should use this,

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
to get a better report at the end.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Plus, add some additional information

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
that you can see.

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
With this summarization step,

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
now again,

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I will say again,

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I know it's hard for you to imagine,

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
if you listen to us visually,

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
as a podcast,

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
then I will put a link to it below,

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
so that people can see this sketch.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's a bit dramatic,

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
if possible.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But,

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
this last step,

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
summarization,

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you have it written there,

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
that you have 4GPT-4O,

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and,

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and,

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
what is it,

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
what did you write?

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Gemini.

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Gemini, yeah.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So,

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
do you try both at the same time,

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
or do they complement each other,

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
or what's the difference?

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It depends on the workflow.

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So,

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
only for summarization,

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I use one,

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but for example,

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
if you have a summarization

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
from one side,

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
then I use another,

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
because maybe you don't need

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
such good logic.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Now,

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
in fact,

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
in the last iteration,

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I use one,

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
maybe something better,

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
maybe not,

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
for the final summarization.

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But,

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
if you only get,

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
after I scrape a page,

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I only get two states,

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
in which this page goes,

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
then I can also use 4O,

239
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
or 4O mini.

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
OK.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And,

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
what did you use now?

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So,

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
there's LangChain,

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and LamaIndex,

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
which are some frameworks

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that make the flow easier,

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
right?

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Do you use any of those,

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
or is it even better?

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No,

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
not really.

253
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
For my specific use case,

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
it wasn't that relevant,

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
so I didn't use any of those.

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
None of those, OK.

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Then it's completely simple for me.

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry,

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have a bigger question.

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No,

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
here,

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
there's another component,

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
which is also in the name,

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
it's called BrowserUse.

265
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's a component,

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
which was developed

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
by a Slovenian-Swiss combo,

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
from which you also,

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
on Y Combinator,

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
made,

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think,

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
$17 million in investments.

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So, Gregor,

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
if you're listening,

275
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I hope you're listening,

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
OK,

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
we're also listening.

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So,

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I see that you also use

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
this BrowserUse.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Now,

282
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'd like you to tell us,

283
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
in your own words,

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
what is this BrowserUse,

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
because I see that it's always

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
more important for products

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
like yours.

288
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, please,

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
tell us what BrowserUse is.

290
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's a tool,

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
a platform,

292
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
which helps you

293
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
create a web agent.

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it's specifically used

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
as a fallback option,

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
how to get,

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
how to get from a domain,

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
how to get to

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
which are open,

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
so to speak,

301
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
open positions.

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Jobs that are currently

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
being offered.

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
First of all,

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm just trying,

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
if there's a domain

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
slash careers,

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
if it's already there,

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
but sometimes they have

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
open positions,

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
for example,

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
on About Us.

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So,

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
first of all,

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm trying,

316
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
if there's something like that,

317
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
if not,

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
then I use BrowserUse

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to, in fact,

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
autonomously navigate

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
on the back side,

322
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
to try to find

323
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
where,

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
where is that list

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
that has open jobs.

326
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Which, in fact,

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
is a good indicator,

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
for some kind of

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
business insight.

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
For example,

331
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
if there was an open position

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
for six months,

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and now it's closed,

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
that might mean something.

335
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Or if they put

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
a new position out there

337
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
for a specific engineer,

338
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
a role,

339
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
it might mean

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that they're now

341
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
focusing on

342
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
some other vertical,

343
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
for example.

344
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Excellent insight,

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
OK.

346
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And this BrowserUse,

347
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
now I know Playwright,

348
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and I know Selenium.

349
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Selenium initially has

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
some kind of

351
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
standard,

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and everything works

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
with which

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
you automate

355
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
the browser.

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Primarily intended

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
for testing,

358
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
but it's also very useful

359
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
for scraping, right?

360
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes.

361
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Playwright is also

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
some kind of

363
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
modern version of that.

364
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Does this BrowserUse

365
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
then use

366
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
something from that,

367
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
or does it

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
open a new

369
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
browser,

370
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and then

371
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
manipulates it

372
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
as a user?

373
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If I'm not mistaken,

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
it uses Playwright,

375
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
under it, yes.

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So, basically,

377
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the browser is

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
fed in the back,

379
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
right?

380
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

381
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Then you have

382
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
LLM, or

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Large Vision Model,

384
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
used then

385
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
for autonomous

386
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
navigation,

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
depending on

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
the device

389
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you're using.

390
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So, basically,

391
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
it automatically

392
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
uses a picture,

393
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
or a video,

394
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to navigate

395
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
where it is,

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
so it doesn't

397
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
have to go

398
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
to a small

399
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
park,

400
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
or a house,

401
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
right?

402
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You have two

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
modes,

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I mean,

405
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you have two modes.

406
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's much more

407
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
accurate if you

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
use,

409
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
depending on

410
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
what you're doing,

411
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
a screenshot of

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
a page.

413
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Before that,

414
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
it used

415
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
JavaScript Execution

416
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to create

417
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
bounding boxes

418
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
around inputs,

419
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and then,

420
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
on the basis of

421
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
that,

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
it used

423
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Large Vision

424
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Model to

425
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
determine

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
what I'm

427
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
clicking,

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
or how to

429
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
do it,

430
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
what I'm not

431
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
clicking on

432
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the front page,

433
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
so I can

434
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
finish the

435
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
task I

436
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
gave it.

437
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But that

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
means that

439
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
you have

440
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
a Persep

441
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
instance,

442
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
or you're

443
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
using it

444
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
hosted,

445
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
or what

446
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
is the

447
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
flow?

448
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Persep is the

449
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
right instance.

450
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's powerful.

451
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's an

452
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
open-source

453
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
project,

454
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
so you

455
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
can do it

456
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
yourself.

457
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do you

458
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
move it to

459
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
a container?

460
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No,

461
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
it's direct.

462
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ah,

463
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
it's direct.

464
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
OK,

465
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
OK.

466
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Damn,

467
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
that was

468
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
a lot

469
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
of challenges

470
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
for me,

471
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
from

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
scraping,

473
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
to

474
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
different

475
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
cloud flares,

476
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
protection,

477
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and

478
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
V0,

479
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
as you can

480
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
see,

481
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
it's an

482
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
automated

483
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
browser,

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and it blocks

485
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you.

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The solution

487
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
here is

488
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that you

489
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
use an

490
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
undetected

491
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Chrome browser,

492
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
which,

493
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
in fact,

494
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
covers all

495
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the automated

496
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
signals.

497
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So,

498
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
yeah,

499
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
you can

500
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
combine the

501
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
two,

502
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and then

503
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
you can

504
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
scrape

505
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
most of

506
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the pages.

507
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And

508
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
if

509
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
we were

510
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to

511
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
say that

1007
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
visual

1008
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
model,

1009
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
so that

1010
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
the

1011
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
user sees

1012
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
the

1013
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
page in

1014
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
a similar

1015
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
way as

1016
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the

1017
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
user sees

1018
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
it, and

1019
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
and Google Ads, and a lot of other businesses are just looking at that.

1020
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,400
So it seems to you that if you add even more data to that data collection,

1021
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,520
you will get even more interesting and more data,

1022
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,240
and probably also more frequent reports, and so on.

1023
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,520
That's right, and then at the beginning you have that big enterprise company,

1024
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,520
that somehow wants to take over everything.

1025
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,200
Now you used the term vibe-coding there.

1026
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,400
What are you laughing at?

1027
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,959
Where is that connection for the audience who doesn't know that term yet?

1028
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:45,240
To describe who is a vibe-coder and what does a vibe-coder do?

1029
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,840
At least it works.

1030
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
It's a prompt.

1031
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,240
Well, I'm sorry to say that.

1032
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,560
Yes, actually, vibe-coding means that you use AI for programming.

1033
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Now there are a lot of tools out there.

1034
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,839
Cursor, Windsurf is one of them, and both of them have really exploded in popularity.

1035
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,760
And yes, it's true that even non-programmers can program something.

1036
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,120
That's the concept.

1037
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,480
Although, soon they will realize that they will have to program everything,

1038
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
and that knowledge is very useful,

1039
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,199
but even for someone who already knows that, it takes a lot of time.

1040
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:32,279
But is it because you write a combination of prompt,

1041
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,199
and then that classic correction for prompt,

1042
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:40,599
or is it always just with prompt interactions with code?

1043
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,360
Most of the time, it's just a prompt.

1044
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,040
You write something, then you look if it's correct,

1045
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
and if it's not, you put it in a decline.

1046
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,599
You learn those codes, and then you write what you want.

1047
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:56,919
But, you know, do you still need to know what you generated?

1048
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,919
We're still there.

1049
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,919
We're still there.

1050
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,760
I mean, you have a very wide engineering background,

1051
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,240
you worked on visual systems and stuff.

1052
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,199
I imagine that you understand what you generated before,

1053
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,279
and you will merge it inside.

1054
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,279
I always ask myself, is it still important?

1055
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,279
You need to know more.

1056
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,279
Probably, in a few years, it won't be anymore.

1057
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,279
When I was a programmer, I was a product manager,

1058
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,279
I wrote requirements.

1059
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,279
We'll see.

1060
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,279
But for now, we're not there yet.

1061
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,279
The models are not there yet.

1062
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,279
I think this is a good starting point

1063
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,279
for today's Slovenian AI meetup.

1064
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Well, Eric, let's wrap up this conversation.

1065
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Once again, I would encourage you

1066
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
to check out the SPI Delta product.

1067
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
The link is in the description.

1068
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
It's a slide that destroys architecture.

1069
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Thank you for your attention,

1070
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
and I'll see you next time.

1071
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Thank you.
