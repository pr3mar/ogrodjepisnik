1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's start with the new episode of Grodje.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today I have in front of me and in front of the microphone Benjamin DÅ¾uburja from Zebra BI.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's a Slovenian business that deals with the development of business intelligence products.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Benjamin will be going to the Congress Square after this podcast,

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where he will have three lectures at Slovenia AI meetup.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He will be talking about agents.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You will be running, I will give you 20 minutes to explain what you are doing and what is so interesting about your work.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Benjamin, welcome.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Tell me what Zebra BI is all about.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Zebra BI is a company that started with the development of SAS solutions for business intelligence.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We developed a plugin for Microsoft Excel, where you can visualize your data.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When you click on it, you get a chart.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It was great.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It followed a standard of how good it is to present the data,

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
so that the stakeholders that you present insights to,

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
can quickly understand what you are doing,

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and can quickly decide on the basis of these visualizations.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I saw this product in Excel a while ago,

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
when I was working on Dell EPS.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was fascinated by what people were doing with Excel.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When I saw this plugin, I was like, wow.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This plugin doesn't just create a pie chart,

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but it has terms that I don't understand at all.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Is it a special tool or not?

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It is a very specific tool, a very advanced tool.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We experienced this boom with Power BI,

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
when Microsoft introduced Power BI in 2014-2015.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We were one of the first to look into it.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We saw the potential in this tool,

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and the BI field started to develop.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We then rewritten our visualization in Power BI.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It started as a relatively simple visualization,

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
with two different plugins,

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
which we then developed more and more.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now it is a fully interactive visualization,

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
in which you can directly prepare various calculations,

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
add new items directly via QA.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It is very responsive.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The main point is to visualize these insights as best as possible.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We achieved success together with Power BI on KPP.

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you want to use this tool in Excel or Power BI,

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
do you have to prepare your data in such a way that it works?

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It is very complicated.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It is a good question.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It is a very good question,

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because in the current or previous versions of products,

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
a specific form of data is needed so that you can use it well.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We have also taught our partners how to prepare their data.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is a very interesting topic,

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because it becomes very interesting with AI technology,

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
because you can also send this bottleneck to an AI agent.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you go to the product page of Zebra,

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you can see that it is Zebra for Office,

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and you can use this widget in PowerPoint or Excel.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Then there is the second segment, Power BI,

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
where you can use it as a storage.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Now you have opened the third vertical.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I assume you work the most on this vertical,

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
where you call Zebra AI.

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is a visual tool.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I got a look at the slides you will have today,

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and I scrolled inside,

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and then I was inside the YouTube demo of your Zebra AI product.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In the demo, you probably choose data from some Excel,

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and drag and drop it into the UI of Zebra AI,

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and boom, boom, boom, boom, I see charts,

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
second, third, sales, up, and everything.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Additionally, I have the input, so I can print,

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and it's really, wow, a quantum leap visually.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know if these are synthetic data or real data,

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but it seems to me that you really feel

73
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
a real leap with this technology.

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
How do you feel about it?

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It must be very exciting for you.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's very exciting,

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and the idea of automating the whole process

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
from the very beginning,

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but we couldn't really realize it.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can achieve this with a large number of codes,

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
algorithms, some settings,

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
how the tool behaves in certain situations,

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
but it was a lot of effort,

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and also the classic data science approaches,

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
which can, for example,

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
from the raw data you get,

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
somehow prepare,

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
for example, make a table,

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
an individual table,

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
what does a table mean,

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
so that you can make decisions on the basis of it.

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They were very soft,

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and difficult to adapt to the domain of data

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
for which we are specialized,

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
such as sales, finance, and business data.

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And then, when it came out,

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that was November 2022,

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
it was already impressive,

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and we saw some potential in it,

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and then at the beginning of the next year,

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
when we saw these concepts of tools and agents,

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
we realized that this is a breakthrough,

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and we got an idea

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
of how we could build a system

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that would be quite flexible,

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
it wouldn't need a single set of code

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to cover all the cases,

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
but would somehow understand the data

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and make certain decisions.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then we started developing Zebra AI,

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
we made a proof of concept,

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
we were all shocked,

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and then we decided to develop it further,

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and then I,

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I was alone at the time,

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I started to develop it further,

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and then we expanded the team.

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's go a bit deeper,

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
tell me what is BI,

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
business intelligence,

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
how does it work,

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and how does it relate to business intelligence?

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Business intelligence is a field

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
that deals with a lot of issues,

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it is primarily business analysts,

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
they deal with the analysis of business data,

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
primarily internal data of a company,

128
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
how it operates, etc.,

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and they also analyze

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
SQL, ETL,

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
which is used as a tool

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to transform and clean data

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
from the beginning,

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
then they go on to model,

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
understand data,

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
connect it, search it,

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
prepare insights,

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
build visualizations,

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
dashboards, etc.,

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
prepare messages for stakeholders,

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and then add recommendations.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
All of this together

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
is called business intelligence.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It is not enough to know only SQL,

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you also need to know

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
business aspects,

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
processes,

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
the importance of data,

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
because you need to know

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
if it is correct or not.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes, you definitely need to know the field well,

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but also, depending on how far you go

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
with the last step,

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
some recommendations for management,

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and to some extent you need to know

156
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the importance of the results.

157
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The fact that companies want to

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
prepare data,

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
means that there is a lot of work

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
for BI or tools,

161
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
which, if they are good,

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
will help you prepare the data,

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
they will also help you

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
prepare high-level data.

165
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It is always more important

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that these segments are healthy,

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and that the data is up-to-date.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It is often not like that.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It is always the same.

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Especially in smaller or medium-sized companies,

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
they don't have a team of people

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
who would deal with it,

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and this is the segment

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that is the most interesting for us.

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
From a certain perspective,

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
these are the people who are looking for solutions.

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They see this technology, AI,

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and they see a change in it.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wow, this will solve this situation.

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Maybe I won't need to employ someone from BI,

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but I can skip some steps with this smart tool,

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and I will get some insights that will help me

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I hope people understand what BI is.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's talk about these agents.

186
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Can you tell us

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
what exactly these agents mean

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
in the context of AI?

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What are these agents?

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
For me, agents are,

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
as far as I remember,

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
reinforcement learning,

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
where we have agents

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
who communicate with the environment

195
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and then get feedback from the environment

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and work in return.

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
In this case,

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
we have LLMs,

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
which we can use

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
as a core for brainwashing the agent,

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and they have access to the environment,

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
which is an additional tool.

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A typical example is

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
writing and extracting code

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
on the basis of data.

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
An agent can write a piece of code

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
to answer a user's question,

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
get results,

209
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and then decide

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
whether he did the right thing

211
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
or whether he will try again

212
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
or decide to go back to the user.

213
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
In this sense,

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
this is the definition of an agent.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We can imagine this as

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the brains of a robot,

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
a large language model,

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
which can interact with the world

219
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
through some processes, mechanisms, and tooling.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It has a perception of the world,

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
it has the ability to interact with the world,

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and then it probably also learns,

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
or is it a matter of conversation?

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It can also be counter-learned.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Everything is definitely learned from this context.

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
With these interactions,

227
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
you can learn new things.

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There are also different architectures

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
where you can learn new things.

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
For example, you can learn about cancer,

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
or you can learn online

232
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
about the effects of cancer.

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know,

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't think this is a need for an agent.

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's more of an interaction with the environment

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and some kind of autonomy.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Often people associate agents with autonomy.

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It flows in a loop.

239
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
An agent can also be imagined

240
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
as a workflow in the final implementation.

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You will do this and that,

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you will have some loops,

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
you can suspend or move.

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Can you give us an example

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
of what an agent or process looks like

246
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
in your Zebra AI?

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let me give you an example.

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's a great question.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If I can.

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I will think about how to put it.

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We use agents in all the phases

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that I mentioned,

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
for example,

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
in the last version.

255
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
An agent tries to determine

256
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
how clean the data is,

257
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
how it meets the requirements

258
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that we have,

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
so that the remainder works as it should.

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It is also able to clean them in a loop,

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
improve them,

262
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and then move on to the next step,

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
which is semantic modeling.

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is primarily about understanding the data well.

265
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you have a SQL database on Input,

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
you want to understand

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
what certain columns represent,

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
what values are present there,

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and what these values mean

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
for certain combinations,

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
for certain processes,

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
for analysis, etc.

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is where a lot can be done.

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You can create graphs,

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
networks,

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
where you define relationships,

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
dependencies, etc.

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The next step is explorative analysis,

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
where we have five agents

280
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
who decide on the basis of some guidelines

281
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and tools

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
what to look for in the data,

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
where you can do an extensive search

284
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
of a specific column of data

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and look for patterns,

286
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
outliers,

287
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
various curiosities,

288
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and then move them forward.

289
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The next phase is visualization

290
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
of these interesting results.

291
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We have integrated with the agents,

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
we have shown them

293
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
an interface with our visualizations

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
so that they can show the data,

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the results, and build a dashboard.

296
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The agent decides

297
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
which dimensions will be shown,

298
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
which filters will be applied.

299
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you have to limit it somehow?

300
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes, definitely.

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You limit it with these tools

302
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and with checking its output.

303
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You require the output to be

304
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
precisely structured,

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
like JSON,

306
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and then you also check

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
what is shown in the data.

308
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Then you can sparse it

309
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and build a dashboard.

310
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The last step is summarization,

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
a classic LLM use case,

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
where you can try to

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
recommend something interesting

314
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
to look at in the future,

315
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
so that your attention is focused

316
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
on some insights.

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Great!

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
My experience was there.

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
In Grodno,

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
it's not just an enterprise company,

321
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
but we have an Excel table

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
with these finances,

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and I dragged it into my Excel table.

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The first step was

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
when I found out

326
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that the data was like this,

327
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and I received 3 or 4 warnings

328
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that the data was not OK

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and that it could be delayed.

330
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It could be delayed with analysis

331
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
or import, but it warned me

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that I wouldn't be able to do it

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
until I clicked Next.

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But today,

335
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
as you said before,

336
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
you helped to shape the data

337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
so that it could be analyzed better.

338
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Today, this problem is being solved

339
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in a very concrete way.

340
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I was surprised that the data

341
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
was not in the right shape,

342
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
but it managed to make a few charts

343
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and to see that we are ready.

344
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I have to say that what you say

345
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
works legitimately and I hope

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that you will improve it.

347
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It was very fascinating

348
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
when I saw the widgets

349
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that were the same as in Power BI,

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and how you reuse it.

351
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Today, I have a chat input

352
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and I can ask him some questions.

353
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I like the fact that today

354
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
he understands the data.

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You get a feeling

356
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
that he knows what kind of data

357
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
he has, what he can say

358
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and what he cannot say.

359
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you also deal with this?

360
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is the last big goal, right?

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes, this is the consequence

362
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
of iterating on these agents

363
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
all the time, trying to improve them.

364
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is the whole workflow

365
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
that I described earlier.

366
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We are trying to achieve

367
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
this effect,

368
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
so that the system really understands

369
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
what it is doing.

370
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Thanks to the agents,

371
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
it somehow saves us,

372
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and we hope that it will improve.

373
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I have already asked this question

374
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
before, but I don't know

375
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
if I can correct myself.

376
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This is a good question.

377
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Do you use chat GPT,

378
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
source models, combination models,

379
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Gemini?

380
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Is this a relevant question?

381
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Are these models so good

382
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
that they are all pretty much the same?

383
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Is this a meaningful question?

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
To a certain extent, yes.

385
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
For a specific agent,

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
you need more capable models

387
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that give more detailed answers

388
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and results.

389
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The rest of the pipeline

390
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
depends on the results.

391
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Here we have a combination

392
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
of enclosed sources.

393
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We have already experimented

394
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
with open source.

395
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
At the time, there was no DeepSeek R1.

396
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There were no on-par results

397
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
with closed source models.

398
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
This is definitely something

399
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
that we are still preparing for.

400
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
When open source models

401
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
are on par,

402
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
this leads to additional things,

403
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
such as a security database.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Are there any models

405
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
for large language models

406
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
that specialize in finance?

407
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Is this a niche?

408
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Is it possible to pay someone

409
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to do this or to distill it

410
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
just for the financial industry

411
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
or for visualization?

412
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You can pay to distill,

413
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
but you can't pay to take

414
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
smaller and more specialized models.

415
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
For example, for finance,

416
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you can pay $70 billion to LLM

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
to make a Chai GPT

418
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
in O3 with reasoning

419
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and a billion other parameters.

420
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The tasks that these agents solve

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
require a lot of reasoning

422
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and this specialized model

423
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
is what gives us good results

424
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and is better for larger models

425
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
all at once.

426
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So the reasoning process

427
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
improves the one-shot approach?

428
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes.

429
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Where do you talk to yourself

430
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
until you're confident it's the right answer?

431
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Is that a mantra?

432
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes, it's a way of thinking,

433
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
it's a time to think about the task.

434
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Some tasks are not specifically coding tasks,

435
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but they are tasks where you look at the structure of the dataset

436
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and mark which columns are which,

437
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
what do you think,

438
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
how are you going to model those columns,

439
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and not mark the properties of those columns.

440
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So, in fact, for such purposes,

441
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
they are much better in our experiments,

442
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
especially the larger models.

443
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You're making a lot of water,

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm going to make a little commercial.

445
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
In Grodno, maybe because of the well-known Patreons,

446
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
thank you,

447
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and maybe also because of the companies

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
VisionEch, Kaldi, HumanFrog and Koforki,

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
who give us storage.

450
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Thank you for being with us.

451
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Now we have the last five minutes.

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm more interested in the existence now,

453
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
let's say that a few years ago there was a boom

454
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
with OpenAI and 4GPT,

455
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and you did a lot of leaps,

456
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and then LAMA, and so on.

457
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Are we now entering a period

458
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
when this ecosystem,

459
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I won't say standardizes,

460
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
but are we at a point where these tasks are interchangeable,

461
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and are already forming some standards?

462
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Now specifically,

463
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
in the last few weeks,

464
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I've noticed that this MCP has become

465
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
a de facto standard for doing some extensions.

466
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
At the end of the month,

467
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I realized that MCP is Model Context Protocol,

468
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and the idea is that through a client

469
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that runs your LLM model,

470
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
or an agent, for example,

471
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
using a standard protocol,

472
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
you can call tools or capabilities

473
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
that can be on a server,

474
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
which means that you can have a weather tool,

475
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and it will tell you what the weather is like,

476
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and the model will call that tool

477
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and tell you the weather.

478
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's a classic example.

479
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You can send an email,

480
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and the tool will send you an email.

481
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Have you ever played with this?

482
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Maybe you can say something about it,

483
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
because I see that it's becoming a very hot topic,

484
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and a next phase of integration of models.

485
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yes, yes.

486
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
My sister came to me,

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and I check it every day.

488
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I was at MCP last week.

489
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes, I think it's definitely great

490
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that this access to various tools is being standardized.

491
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
At the moment, it seems to me that everyone,

492
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I think this is an introduction to Antropica,

493
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
OpenAI still has its own way of using these tools,

494
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
if you use their LLMs,

495
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
they somehow expose you

496
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
in their best way how to use these tools.

497
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This seems to me also because of the way they are taught.

498
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
In what format is it best to use this?

499
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So I think it would be great

500
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
if this standard would be used in the future

501
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
for some new models,

502
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and it would be so effective,

503
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and all models would know how to use it well.

504
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But at the moment, we're not there yet.

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I was talking about the spec of this MCP,

506
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the basics are for JSON RPC,

507
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
so you have to use, let's say,

508
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
capabilities or tools,

509
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
make a request, where do you have the tools,

510
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and then also methods,

511
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
face recognition, arguments,

512
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and he knows that.

513
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What's interesting is that it enables streaming,

514
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
so if he gets a request,

515
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
he can answer it like that,

516
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
or he can answer it later,

517
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
what are the new capabilities,

518
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and it also has a way

519
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to send it back as a notification.

520
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So it's a very interesting way of integration,

521
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
it will definitely be possible to do with these parts,

522
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
so I see that it's very...

523
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I see that it's still a bit in the middle,

524
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
but it's definitely a direction

525
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
that I see will be very interesting to think about.

526
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Maybe the last question,

527
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and then I'll let you go.

528
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What do you think...

529
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What do you think...

530
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Will we need more of these analysts in the future,

531
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
or do we just need more large language models,

532
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
or a better process,

533
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
or what do you think?

534
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Do you think that...

535
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Because we also have the same question

536
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
with programmers now,

537
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
because of all those wipe codings,

538
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and that tooling,

539
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
people think,

540
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
oh, we don't need programmers anymore.

541
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Do you think that people will also start

542
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
using these tools?

543
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I don't know,

544
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
but I hope so.

545
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Definitely,

546
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I think it's very similar,

547
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
what programmers are experiencing,

548
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and I think the answer is also very similar,

549
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
because in BI,

550
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
you can also use writing some codes,

551
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
some queries,

552
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to get...

553
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's hard to say,

554
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
but I think,

555
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
now I think,

556
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that for some of these lighter tasks,

557
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
an agent is already able to do a lot,

558
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and it's almost...

559
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I don't know,

560
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
those solutions,

561
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
like Devin,

562
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
or those automatic programmers,

563
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
who would do anything,

564
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
are already impressive.

565
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They can do a lot of other tasks,

566
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but they also get stuck,

567
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and they always make more mistakes,

568
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
or make some inoptimal things,

569
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
and they need to be corrected all the time.

570
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So, I think that,

571
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
first of all,

572
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
it will take a long time,

573
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
that we will also,

574
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
for some, not so senior people,

575
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
that we won't need them anymore,

576
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
but especially for those seniors,

577
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
who will be supervising AI,

578
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I think,

579
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
it will take some time,

580
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and also in BI,

581
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I think we will need analysts

582
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
for such a long time,

583
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
because, for example,

584
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
in BI, I think,

585
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the adoption of AI

586
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
is a bit slower,

587
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
because it's a field

588
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that deals with sensitive data,

589
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and people are afraid of AI,

590
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
they don't understand it as much,

591
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
as maybe programmers do.

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Great.

593
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Benjamin, thank you for your time,

594
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and good luck with your sales.

595
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Thank you.
