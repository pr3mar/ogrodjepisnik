00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Dear listeners, dear listeners, welcome to the 4th season of episode 2 in Grodno.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we will have an extra super fine.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why am I talking so enthusiastically?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
First of all, because all millenials and zoomers have a bad focus.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So stay tuned to this episode of all the first N minutes.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's talk about N, of course.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today we will talk a little about hardware, a little about it.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
David Zobavnik from DVSoft is with us, and his title is...

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Help me, David.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Head of Embedded Software Development.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or the head of integrated connection in something deep.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What do you think?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think it's either integrated or integrated.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It depends on where you ask for a fax in Slovenia.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ok, the best.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now, what would we do without Tomaž?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So today we have Tomaž here to massage David,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so we can talk about hardware together.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm actually the biggest noob here,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
because I don't have a company that makes hardware.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I still have a lot of customers in Amazon.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, every good episode or content,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
whether it's a podcast or YouTube,

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
starts with a good hook.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So David, we're interested in,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
besides fresh hardware,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
what does DVSoft have,

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
even if it's not Porsche.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How many do you have?

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So I'm asking you,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
do you know any engineers who put something on themselves,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and then Porsche it for you?

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I mean, yeah.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Those people who make hardware don't Porsche,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
at least not Porsche.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, so in my opinion,

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the way I know those engineers,

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
it's the same for us,

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
because we were told that we're engineers,

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and then there's that extra money,

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
where we put some graphics,

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
cards that have been expensive lately,

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and then maybe those who are a bit more financially literate,

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
like ETFs,

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that have a low budget,

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or low expenses.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, okay.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Porsche is a waste of money.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, okay.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But if you have a Porsche,

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm just wondering,

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
where do you put your hardware?

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I think it's BMW.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
BMW?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Or did you photoshop it,

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
for the marketing sake?

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, and this car, for example,

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
has been redesigned,

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and it's been done so that

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we can put it on display,

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and now we're able to measure everything

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in this car.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, for example,

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
it has a few hundred sensors,

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and we can measure everything.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What is all of this?

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I mean, temperature,

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
shaking,

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
brightness,

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
sleep,

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
speed,

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
flow,

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
position,

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
then acceleration,

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
then, let's say,

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
what's the temperature,

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know,

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
how the engine is working,

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
or if something is strangely shaking,

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
or maybe the engine is a bit broken,

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and now it's fixed as it should be.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I don't know,

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
also, for example,

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
in the automotive industry,

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
if I'm specific,

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
if it's a bit big,

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you also get data through CAN,

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
so you also have,

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
let's say,

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a thousand parameters

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
that you get from their ECUs,

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and so on.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is the pleasure

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
in engineering

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that you do with CAN?

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Or, no,

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll put it differently.

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
From 1 to 10,

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
what is your experience?

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
With CAN?

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, what is it?

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, let me first explain

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
what CAN is.

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, yes.

107
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a protocol

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that actually works

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
on an electrical level.

110
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You get a specific signal,

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and then you decode it into bytes,

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and then you extract

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
some information from it.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now, as I enjoy it,

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
from 1 to 10,

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have to admit

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that I'm like two at the moment.

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe not specifically now,

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or in the last few weeks,

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
we think about it,

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but we have CAN FD,

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
which is perhaps

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
a slightly newer protocol

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that is able to send

125
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
a little more data from it.

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But, no,

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I personally don't like it,

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and I also feel that

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
with time,

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
there will always be less CAN,

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
because, I don't know,

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the automotive industry

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
is also,

134
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
which is modern,

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
ethernet.

136
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So, that's,

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
in addition to everything else,

138
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I would also say

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that in the automotive industry,

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
ethernet is becoming

141
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
more and more popular.

142
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is that CAN encrypted?

143
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No, only by itself, no.

144
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If I turn the knob

145
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
in the car,

146
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and switch to CAN bus,

147
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
what can I do?

148
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can choose

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
where the stream is,

150
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but then you have to know

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
what kind of data it represents.

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But I would say

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that according to my information,

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
a lot of it is not

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
specifically encoded.

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You have to know

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
what kind of information

158
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it is,

159
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
which all developers

160
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
hide,

161
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but if you know

162
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
where to get it,

163
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
which is a lot of secrecy,

164
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
then you can

165
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
practically get

166
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that information.

167
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ok, and you can

168
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
even go further with it?

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can.

170
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ok.

171
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And how do you work

172
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
with that,

173
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
if everyone is so stupidly

174
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
hiding it?

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Isn't that

176
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
a common bus

177
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that everyone would hold?

178
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know,

179
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
some kind of USB in the car,

180
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
so that everyone has

181
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
a common language

182
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
over CAN bus?

183
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Isn't that so?

184
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think it is.

185
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's how it is.

186
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Those who use

187
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the software,

188
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
they receive

189
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
some data,

190
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and then everyone,

191
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
every Amazon user,

192
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
has to know

193
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
where to get

194
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that information.

195
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's why

196
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the information

197
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you find

198
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is hidden.

199
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ah, ok,

200
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
so you need

201
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
some kind of

202
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
ground truth.

203
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes, yes.

204
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Ok.

205
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When we were

206
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
talking about

207
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
measuring,

208
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and let's go

209
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
in that direction,

210
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you said

211
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that you

212
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
measure,

213
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and I'm interested

214
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
in this,

215
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I mean,

216
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
where in the software

217
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is the core business,

218
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the measurement systems,

219
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
right?

220
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I always

221
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
wonder

222
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
where is the

223
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
beginning?

224
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who is

225
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the source

226
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
of truth

227
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
for things,

228
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in general?

229
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't know.

230
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We measure,

231
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know,

232
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
distances.

233
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Ok, a meter

234
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is today,

235
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think,

236
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
an establishment

237
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
of how precise

238
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
a meter is,

239
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
that it is

240
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
a mathematical thing,

241
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
right?

242
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But who gives

243
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
us our

244
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
right second,

245
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
which is

246
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
perfect?

247
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who are these

248
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
authorities?

249
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I would say

250
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
so,

251
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think

252
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
some physicist

253
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
said

254
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that everything

255
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
is relative.

256
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Now,

257
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
for example,

258
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we have

259
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
our own

260
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
devices,

261
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which we

262
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
have to measure

263
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
somewhere,

264
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and we,

265
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
for example,

266
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
use a

267
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
calibrator,

268
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
which is

269
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
a big

270
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
device,

271
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
also expensive,

272
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
which is

273
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
calibrated with

274
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
a better

275
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
calibrator,

276
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and so on.

277
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ok.

278
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Which is,

279
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
yes,

280
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
at the end,

281
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the last

282
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
source of truth,

283
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
you have

284
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
some physical

285
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
definitions,

286
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and probably

287
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
some facts,

288
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because we know

289
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that they are

290
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
so and so

291
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
precise.

292
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ok.

293
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
For example,

294
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know,

295
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
for GPS hours,

296
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
we know

297
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
that they are

298
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
so and so

299
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
precise.

300
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So there is

301
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
a source

302
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
of truth,

303
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and it's

304
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
good enough

305
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
for your

306
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
needs.

307
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then

308
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you have

309
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
verification,

310
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you have

311
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
certificates,

312
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and knowledge

313
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
of the

314
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
provider,

315
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and then

316
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you believe

317
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that what

318
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
you use

319
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
is really

320
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
so and so

321
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
precise.

322
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ok.

323
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And do

324
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have to

325
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
verify it

326
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
independently

327
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or?

328
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes,

329
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think

330
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it's

331
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
good enough

332
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
within those

333
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
parameters,

334
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and so on.

335
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ok.

336
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Very interesting.

337
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
For example,

338
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
when I first

339
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
started,

340
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
well,

341
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think

342
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
we all know

343
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
this,

344
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
but when

345
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I first

346
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
heard that

347
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
this is

348
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
one of the

349
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
more successful

350
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Slovenian

351
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
businesses

352
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in this

353
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
field,

354
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I thought

355
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
ok,

356
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
what do

357
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I, as a

358
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
layman,

359
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
need to

360
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
do?

361
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And then

362
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I thought

363
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
ok,

364
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
at home

365
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
we all

366
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
have,

367
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
for example,

368
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
ok,

369
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
now that we

370
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
are more

371
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
technically

372
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
advanced,

373
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you have

374
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a shovel,

375
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and you

376
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
have a

377
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
multimeter,

378
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and a

379
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
thermometer,

380
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and that's

381
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
where it

382
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
ends.

383
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So,

384
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
tell us

385
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
a little

386
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
bit about

387
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
your

388
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
business,

389
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and

390
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
what

391
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
is it

392
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
like?

393
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ok,

394
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so,

395
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am

396
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
also

397
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
often

398
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
asked

399
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
what

400
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I do

401
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
as a

402
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
member,

403
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and if

404
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I can't

405
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
discuss

406
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
enough,

407
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I say

408
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I do

409
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it as

410
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
a voltmeter.

411
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But,

412
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
maybe,

413
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
what is

414
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
special about

415
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
us?

416
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We

417
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
all

418
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
have

419
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
sensors,

420
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and

421
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
if you

422
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
have an

423
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Eiffel

424
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Tower,

425
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
which is

426
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
400 meters

427
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
tall,

428
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we

429
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
know

430
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the

431
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
dimensions

432
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
of

433
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
things.

434
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's

435
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
one thing.

436
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Another

437
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
thing is

438
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that,

439
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
which is

440
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
very

441
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
important

442
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
in our

443
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
industry,

444
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is that

445
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you

446
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
can

447
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
measure

448
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
things

449
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
from

450
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a distance

451
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
of

452
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
100 nanoseconds

453
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
or

454
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
100 nanoseconds

455
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
with our

456
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
measurements.

457
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What

458
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
do we

459
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
measure?

460
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let me

461
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
say that

462
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we are

463
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
really

464
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
committed

465
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to

466
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
doing

467
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
it

468
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
in a

469
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
way that

470
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
if you

471
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
have

472
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
a structure

473
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
or a

474
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
device

475
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and

476
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you

477
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
don't

478
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
know

479
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
how

480
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
much

481
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
time

482
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
it

483
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
takes

484
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to

485
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
measure

486
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it

487
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you

488
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000

we

1340
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
would

1341

like

1342
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to

1343
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
do

1344
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
it

1345
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
in

1346
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
a

1347
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
different

1348
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
way

1349
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
than

1350
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
These devices were specially designed for this purpose.

1351
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
First of all, they were used to store data.

1352
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Then, I would say, they were used to be used as full-time relays.

1353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Then, this device was used to send data via USB to some computer.

1354
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I would say that this is the core software of Laufa 9 Soft X.

1355
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
This is the application of Laufa on Windows.

1356
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
This is where we started.

1357
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Then, as I mentioned earlier, the next step is to make the ARM processors more powerful.

1358
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Here, we are using the Sitaro AM57, which has an ARM processor on top, A15.

1359
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It has two cores.

1360
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
On top of that, Linux is running normally.

1361
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
These are profiles that have changed a bit.

1362
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
People are working on different profiles.

1363
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There is a microcontroller.

1364
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
FPGA was used for electrotechnics.

1365
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So, they had to know how to connect.

1366
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Here is the ARM processor.

1367
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Then, you have Linux.

1368
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It is very easy for people to get to know Linux.

1369
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Then, there are more programmers, or those who came from the free sphere, for example.

1370
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
This is object programming.

1371
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I would say that architecture is more complicated.

1372
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This is what our parties are using.

1373
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Then, there is the third model, or combination, that I just mentioned.

1374
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You can have a big box, which has eight buttons.

1375
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
On the bottom, there is one more layer, which is a computer.

1376
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It is made on our side.

1377
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It is slightly adjusted, so it can withstand higher and lower temperatures.

1378
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It is a typical computer.

1379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It is a computer that can handle 80 degrees.

1380
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I would say that there are more critical use cases.

1381
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Is it better if it is made more complicated, or does it not matter?

1382
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In the sense that it does one function, and it does it well.

1383
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The more it is made, the more complex it is.

1384
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That is why there is a greater possibility of error.

1385
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Does this play a role?

1386
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes, I would definitely agree with that.

1387
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Our mission is to make life more complicated.

1388
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We are working on multifunctional devices, which do a lot of things in a short time.

1389
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This is where programmers take the hard path and say, we will try to do everything.

1390
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I agree.

1391
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I will say that this is a bit of a debate, because we will spend a lot of time here.

1392
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
In real-time, you want to be more predictable.

1393
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What do you mean by real-time?

1394
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
One millisecond?

1395
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I think the definition of real-time is that something happens to you in response to the current time.

1396
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It can also be one minute.

1397
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I think that 95% of applications in the world, if they have real-time,

1398
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
one millisecond is enough.

1399
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Why is one millisecond enough?

1400
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Because you have mechanical systems that do not have to be fast.

1401
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If something is very fast, it is not as if it were physically moving.

1402
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
OK.

1403
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Let's go, because we can talk a bit more about hardware.

1404
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
In short, let's go step by step.

1405
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I come from the side, and I am the problem for which you do not have solutions on the market.

1406
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
How does it all start?

1407
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And how do we get to the point where you say, OK, this will take 300 hours,

1408
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and so on, and then you deliver it to me.

1409
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
What happens in the middle?

1410
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think you have to be the owner of a factory or something.

1411
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Let's say I am.

1412
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That is why I wanted to say, forget something that is too small.

1413
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or something like that, yes.

1414
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The thing is, when you have a bigger company,

1415
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
there are some schedules of what you would like to have.

1416
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
First of all, our sellers around the world are looking for these schedules,

1417
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and we will make the first check to see how many things we can deliver.

1418
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It is not often that you deliver, but it makes sense to work with them.

1419
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It is often the case that you deliver 80-90% of the points,

1420
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and 10-20% still needs to be done.

1421
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And then you contact our project office,

1422
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and the project office writes down what they would like to have,

1423
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and offers suggestions on how to deal with our existing solutions.

1424
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And the remaining 10%, which is still not enough,

1425
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
they sit down together with the product managers,

1426
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and then we have the product owners,

1427
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
we have a team of product managers who take care of the products

1428
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
within their streams,

1429
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and then we talk together,

1430
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and we analyze whether this could be done or not,

1431
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and, for example, how much would it cost to do it.

1432
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
We make an assessment,

1433
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
then we look at the schedule,

1434
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and then we choose a priority,

1435
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
which is important to us.

1436
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Sometimes it is not just the money, but also the strategy.

1437
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
For example, when we first started working for NASA,

1438
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
we didn't have that much money,

1439
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and it was a very prestigious project from the point of view we came from.

1440
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But maybe, when the company left,

1441
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
they suggested where they would like to go,

1442
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and it is a very good opportunity to join together and make this product.

1443
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And then it is up to the decision-makers to go and work on this product.

1444
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Then we have the summer plans,

1445
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
we have the quarterly plans,

1446
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
for example, for one year we make a plan of what we want to do,

1447
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and then for the fourth year,

1448
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
we look at the project and decide

1449
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that this project is a top priority,

1450
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and we start working on it.

1451
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
For example, we divide it into teams,

1452
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
the hardware team has to do this and that,

1453
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
the software team has to do this and that,

1454
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and the engineers inside the team have to assess

1455
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
how much work there is to be done.

1456
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
This is where Igor Kostanđer comes in,

1457
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
who is a big fan of all the developers.

1458
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And then we write the stories and assess how much work there is to be done,

1459
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and then it is done.

1460
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
For example, you think that a successful company like DvSoft

1461
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
doesn't have internal failures,

1462
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
but I hope that DvSoft will also face failures.

1463
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Tell us more about this.

1464
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Tell us, if you can,

1465
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
about a failure that was also expensive,

1466
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and you say, ok, we are done with this.

1467
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It is very interesting,

1468
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
because if someone asked me a year ago,

1469
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I would say something else.

1470
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Ok.

1471
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It is so fresh.

1472
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So fresh, yes.

1473
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And now we only had one failure,

1474
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
which was a problem in itself,

1475
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and which affected all parties.

1476
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
We have synchronous and asynchronous measurements.

1477
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Synchronous measurements are when something comes from a distance,

1478
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
for example at 20 kHz,

1479
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and then you have asynchronous data,

1480
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
which you get in a few seconds,

1481
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and then you have a healthy timestamp.

1482
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And it turns out,

1483
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
we did a big architectural improvement,

1484
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and it turned out that if you do these asynchronous measurements,

1485
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and if you do them for a long time,

1486
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
you can corrupt the data.

1487
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And this is a kind of special scenario that can happen to us.

1488
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And this is, for example,

1489
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
a website, or a kind of scenario,

1490
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
for example,

1491
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
that rents an office,

1492
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
where you can spend a few million per day,

1493
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
make measurements,

1494
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
everything looks fine,

1495
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
and then they want to look at the data,

1496
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and it turns out,

1497
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and this is how it was,

1498
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
that if you quickly took the data,

1499
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
everything looked fine,

1500
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and then you did the measurements,

1501
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and it turned out that it could be corrupted.

1502
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And this happened to us last week.

1503
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What I would say is that it is a matter of luck or misfortune,

1504
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
to be able to correct it in such a way,

1505
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
that those who corrupted the data,

1506
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I would say,

1507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
95% of them would be able to solve it,

1508
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
fortunately.

1509
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I said,

1510
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
it happened to us once,

1511
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that the actual thing affected all parties,

1512
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and that it was the worst thing.

1513
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If you can't measure it,

1514
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
then it's not good,

1515
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
because if you measure it,

1516
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
then it's not good.

1517
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Who is Kregan, for example?

1518
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Who is Slijš?

1519
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, you know,

1520
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
usually,

1521
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I would say,

1522
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
in my opinion,

1523
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
not only in the engineering world,

1524
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
you try this,

1525
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
non-blame culture.

1526
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Okay.

1527
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So, usually,

1528
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
you make a report,

1529
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
you get the results,

1530
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and then you try,

1531
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and then you try,

1532
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and finally,

1533
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
you correct it,

1534
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
because it won't repeat itself.

1535
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So, I would say,

1536
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
here,

1537
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
you learn a lot,

1538
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
especially with a name,

1539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
so that it would stand out.

1540
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes,

1541
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I didn't ask for a name,

1542
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
so that it would be similar.

1543
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
What is the reason for that?

1544
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We created it first,

1545
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
didn't we?

1546
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes.

1547
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It was a software bug.

1548
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The tests weren't found,

1549
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
because you can work on it for a long time,

1550
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
for example,

1551
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I don't know,

1552
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
for a few days,

1553
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
so that you can see the bug.

1554
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay,

1555
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
now,

1556
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
software developer,

1557
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
in my opinion,

1558
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
not software,

1559
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
in my opinion,

1560
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't have to have it.

1561
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Where do you store the data?

1562
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What database do you use?

1563
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's it.

1564
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yes,

1565
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
that's interesting,

1566
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I think,

1567
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
we've come so far,

1568
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I would say,

1569
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
industrially specific,

1570
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
that,

1571
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I would say,

1572
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
when you work with cameras,

1573
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
it's almost like,

1574
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
these are really the data

1575
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that you want

1576
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
to be displayed

1577
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
anywhere.

1578
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay.

1579
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And again,

1580
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
here,

1581
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
it's not like

1582
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I would store them in a database,

1583
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
because I will give,

1584
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't know,

1585
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
one example again,

1586
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
our fastest production

1587
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
is always there,

1588
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
somewhere around 15 million

1589
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
data per second,

1590
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
per channel.

1591
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
How many channels?

1592
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yes,

1593
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
for example,

1594
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I can make 8 channels,

1595
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I can have them,

1596
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't know,

1597
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
10, 20, 30,

1598
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I can make them.

1599
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay.

1600
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And in practice,

1601
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
here you can't use all,

1602
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you can't use the database,

1603
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and again,

1604
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
you store it locally,

1605
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and then maybe

1606
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
when you analyze the data,

1607
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
or you compress them a little bit,

1608
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
then you get

1609
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
the data

1610
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that you want

1611
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to be displayed

1612
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
in the database.

1613
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Okay.

1614
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So,

1615
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
you compress the data,

1616
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and then maybe

1617
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
you can write it down.

1618
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But, for example,

1619
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I will say that

1620
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
our core business

1621
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
is not about

1622
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
storing data,

1623
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
but I will say

1624
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
that we have

1625
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
a startup,

1626
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
or I will say

1627
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
a spin-off,

1628
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
which deals

1629
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
with more modern

1630
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
methods,

1631
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
which are then

1632
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
stored

1633
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
in the database.

1634
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So,

1635
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it's pretty much

1636
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
raw data.

1637
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes,

1638
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
on a disk.

1639
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
On a disk,

1640
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and then...

1641
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
A disk,

1642
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
or a translator?

1643
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
On a disk.

1644
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So,

1645
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I would say

1646
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
that Avender

1647
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is spinning,

1648
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
as well.

1649
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You mean

1650
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
spinning disks?

1651
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes.

1652
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You mean spinning disks?

1653
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yes.

1654
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay.

1655
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
A lot of data,

1656
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
right?

1657
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yes.

1658
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yes,

1659
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
exactly.

1660
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You see,

1661
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I would say

1662
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
that

1663
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
SQLite,

1664
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
or some

1665
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
lightweight

1666
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
engine,

1667
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but...

1668
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
How many

1669
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
seconds,

1670
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
did you say?

1671
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
15 MBs per channel.

1672
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I think

1673
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
15 MBs per channel.

1674
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Okay,

1675
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
that's pretty

1676
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
high numbers.

1677
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But that's

1678
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
an extreme example.

1679
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yes.

1680
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But,

1681
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
despite

1682
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
typical,

1683
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
let's say

1684
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
100 MBs

1685
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
per second,

1686
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
that's typical.

1687
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes,

1688
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
that's a pretty

1689
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
nice number.

1690
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
For example,

1691
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't know if

1692
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
you remember,

1693
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
but the automobile

1694
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
industry

1695
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
is very

1696
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
reliant on

1697
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
data.

1698
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So,

1699
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
at night,

1700
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
this camera

1701
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
would be sent.

1702
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So,

1703
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
you have

1704
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
a computer,

1705
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
which would

1706
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
send a software

1707
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
to a computer,

1708
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
which is

1709
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
basically a

1710
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Windows machine,

1711
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and you store

1712
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
it there.

1713
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It could be

1714
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
a computer

1715
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
or a laptop

1716
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
somewhere

1717
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
in the middle.

1718
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And you have

1719
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
an internal

1720
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
way of...

1721
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I mean,

1722
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm assuming

1723
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that,

1724
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
regardless of

1725
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the type of

1726
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
measurement,

1727
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
whether it's

1728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
length-wise

1729
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
or temperature-wise,

1730
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
whatever,

1731
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
it's all

1732
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
standardized.

1733
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Is it

1734
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
externally

1735
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
standardized,

1736
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
or is it

1737
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
internal?

1738
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You said

1739
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that you'll

1740
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
sort the data

1741
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
in a way

1742
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
that's best

1743
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
for you.

1744
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
We have

1745
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
our own format

1746
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
which is

1747
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
optimized

1748
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
so that

1749
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
it can be

1750
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
saved as

1751
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
soon as

1752
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
possible,

1753
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and so

1754
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that later

1755
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
when I

1756
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
store the

1757
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
data,

1758
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
it can

1759
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
be used

1760
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
in a way

1761
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that's

1762
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
best

1763
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
for me.

1764
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So,

1765
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
we have

1766
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
our own

1767
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
format

1768
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
which is

1769
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
optimized

1770
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
so that

1771
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
later

1772
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
when I

1773
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
store the

1774
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
data,

1775
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
it can

1776
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
be used

1777
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000

and so

1780
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
that later

1781
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
when I

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000

it can

so that

2426
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,600
and we were like, what's going on, let's make it clear.

2427
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,000
At first we thought it was some kind of a contact,

2428
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
because it's a BGA, which means that it's going from the bottom,

2429
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
that it's some kind of a stick slab,

2430
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and when it's heated, the current expands

2431
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
just enough for the stick to reach the stick and start working.

2432
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But what was the catch, or what was the catch,

2433
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
that we chose the wrong value of the current resistance,

2434
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and when the board was heating up,

2435
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
the current went out of the tolerance,

2436
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
so that the current fell into the right tolerance of the chip,

2437
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
which then started to send 100 MHz frequencies from itself.

2438
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's the fun part, when you're lucky and it works.

2439
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yes, exactly.

2440
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That's the best part.

2441
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It's a good learning.

2442
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
But before that, do you have,

2443
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
do you have an internal library,

2444
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I would say, of those components,

2445
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
which you can reuse over and over,

2446
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
so that you know how it works,

2447
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
so that it's just a copy-paste.

2448
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Of course.

2449
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
One thing is the fact that you have these libraries,

2450
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
from which resistance you use capacitors,

2451
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and it's all updated,

2452
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
but I will say,

2453
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
we also work on our components in a modular way,

2454
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
so that you can also use them differently.

2455
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
This will be an example.

2456
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
We had one generation of some components,

2457
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
and then you have the motherboard,

2458
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and then you have the amplifiers,

2459
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and now we can use the same amplifiers,

2460
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
but in a new generation.

2461
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
We also try to reuse all these things as much as possible,

2462
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and so that we drive development,

2463
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
and so that these things are checked as much as possible,

2464
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
because, as I mentioned earlier,

2465
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
you really need a lot of time to check all these things,

2466
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
so that the work is really bearable.

2467
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So it's worth investing in having,

2468
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
let's say, similar components,

2469
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
common components and so on.

2470
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And, in fact, going even further,

2471
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
you also want to have these partners,

2472
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
who, for example, support these things.

2473
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
In our case, it's Eltech.

2474
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
We have been cooperating with them for 15 years,

2475
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and we will continue to cooperate with them,

2476
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
because here, I will say,

2477
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
this trust is very important,

2478
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and you know that if you don't have it,

2479
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
it's completely different,

2480
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
if you don't have one key choice.

2481
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It is very important to trust the whole variety,

2482
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
so that you can trust.

2483
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I will say that it is probably very easy for you,

2484
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
because you have such a wide range,

2485
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
but also a name,

2486
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
that it is possible for you to work against it somehow.

2487
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yes, that's right.

2488
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I mean, you have to work hard,

2489
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
but you also have to help a lot,

2490
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
and you make sure that it is good enough.

2491
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
We will have something,

2492
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
as I said before,

2493
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
we also have some ether cables,

2494
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and you also need power.

2495
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That's why I will say,

2496
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
high voltage power,

2497
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and you can have it fast.

2498
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And, for example, with these cables,

2499
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I don't know,

2500
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
for almost a year,

2501
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
we thought that we got a good provider,

2502
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
who knew how to put the cables together.

2503
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It's all too simple,

2504
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
data, data,

2505
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and then you have your power,

2506
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and it turns out that it's a complex thing.

2507
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But yes, you try,

2508
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and together we have a solution.

2509
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
The best.

2510
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That's a great segue,

2511
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I also want to thank our partners,

2512
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
our supporters,

2513
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Humum, Frog, Kaldi, Visionect,

2514
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
TR Kufr,

2515
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Kufr gives us money for our videos,

2516
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and of course our patrons,

2517
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
who chose us and support us.

2518
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So that was Mini EPP.

2519
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Now I will continue

2520
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
with a high-quality question.

2521
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The best.

2522
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Let's go.

2523
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You mentioned calibration before,

2524
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I will go back a bit,

2525
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
but I am interested,

2526
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
when you put this device somewhere,

2527
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
it's been a little over a year,

2528
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I don't know, 15 years,

2529
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
you have these devices,

2530
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I suppose that these devices

2531
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
have to be measured again,

2532
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
calibrated,

2533
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and then the parties do it locally,

2534
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
how does it look like?

2535
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
That's right,

2536
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
they have to be calibrated once a year,

2537
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
or they have to be measured first,

2538
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and then calibrated,

2539
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
if I can put it that way.

2540
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
We have our own calibration laboratories,

2541
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
we also have,

2542
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
around the world,

2543
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
for example in America,

2544
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
in Asia,

2545
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
we have our own,

2546
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
so we have a few of our

2547
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
certified laboratories,

2548
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
where the parties can

2549
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
buy calibration equipment,

2550
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and then calibrate themselves,

2551
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
even though it's not an official calibration,

2552
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
but it's,

2553
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I don't have the papers,

2554
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
but it's just as valuable

2555
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
in terms of functionality.

2556
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You can measure your instruments

2557
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
yourself.

2558
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We are a bit special here,

2559
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
we make it possible for the parties

2560
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
to calibrate themselves.

2561
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So you are an international company,

2562
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
so on different continents

2563
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
you have these laboratories,

2564
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you have sales, marketing,

2565
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
what else do you have?

2566
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The majority of our development

2567
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
is in Slovenia,

2568
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
we have a majority in Trbovlja,

2569
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and also HQ,

2570
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
we also have a small one in Maribor,

2571
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and in Ljubljana,

2572
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and around the world,

2573
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
we have these development departments,

2574
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
for example one company

2575
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
we bought in the Danube,

2576
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
which specializes in

2577
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
some turbines and measurements.

2578
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Then around the world,

2579
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
we have a large

2580
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
company,

2581
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
and mostly it's local support,

2582
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
it's sales,

2583
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
it's calibration equipment,

2584
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
there are also

2585
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
business developers,

2586
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
who specialize in

2587
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
some type of measurements.

2588
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And if there is a bigger country,

2589
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
like the US,

2590
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
they have their own application engineers,

2591
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
or programmers,

2592
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
who can automate

2593
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
and build applications on top of us.

2594
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I think that in the US

2595
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
we have

2596
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
around 60-700 employees,

2597
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
so you can have such a large team.

2598
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
What does the marketing look like?

2599
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Do you go everywhere?

2600
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I think it's always different,

2601
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
we go to these conferences,

2602
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
CubeCon,

2603
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and I think

2604
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
that in electronics,

2605
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and in the industry,

2606
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
it's always a bit different.

2607
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I have another question for you,

2608
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
if you go to these conferences,

2609
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
who is your competitor?

2610
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Who do you look at so little,

2611
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and you don't really care

2612
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
what you say,

2613
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but you laugh about it.

2614
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I go to these conferences a lot,

2615
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
but I would say that

2616
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
a lot of what our side finds,

2617
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
is that you get to know the people

2618
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
in the industry.

2619
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I don't know,

2620
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
our sellers are good,

2621
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
they have the best tools,

2622
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I don't know,

2623
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
for a product,

2624
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
or a website,

2625
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
they have been selling for 20-30 years,

2626
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and then they have some contacts,

2627
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and they get to know each other.

2628
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Or champagne.

2629
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They get to know the website,

2630
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and if they get to know each other,

2631
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
they get to know the product,

2632
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and then they can do a demo,

2633
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and then again,

2634
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
they get to know each other.

2635
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Now, who is our main competitor?

2636
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I would say that the two biggest companies

2637
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
are HBK,

2638
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Hottinger and Brilliant Care,

2639
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
and National Instruments.

2640
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I would say,

2641
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
that,

2642
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
to be honest,

2643
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
with HBK,

2644
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
we all work together

2645
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
in a venture company,

2646
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
where we decided

2647
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
to have an open-source

2648
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
protocol,

2649
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and SDK,

2650
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
where we all work together,

2651
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
which is called OpenDAQ,

2652
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
so we all work together.

2653
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I would also say,

2654
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
that more competitors

2655
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
are helping us,

2656
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
because I think that we are

2657
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
watching these works,

2658
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
they are being broadcast all the time,

2659
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and I would say,

2660
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
that our competitors,

2661
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I think,

2662
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
that we have the best products,

2663
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
but there is one,

2664
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
which has been changed,

2665
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
it is a Chinese company,

2666
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
and I don't know their names,

2667
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
but I would say,

2668
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that locally,

2669
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
we are losing,

2670
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
because they are a bit protectionist,

2671
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
so if they don't choose us,

2672
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
then it is their business,

2673
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
but I would also say,

2674
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
that Chinese companies,

2675
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
as far as I can see,

2676
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
are more responsive to the market,

2677
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
they are more innovative,

2678
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
they change faster,

2679
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and so,

2680
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
if you ask me,

2681
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
who would be the biggest competitor

2682
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
in 10-20 years,

2683
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I would say,

2684
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Chinese company,

2685
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
because HBK is more

2686
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
like a German company,

2687
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and I would say,

2688
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
that they bought a warehouse,

2689
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
similar to our instrument,

2690
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
and I think,

2691
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
that here they optimize

2692
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
the short-term gain,

2693
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and maybe they fell asleep

2694
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
with the technology itself.

2695
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And you have,

2696
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
you have all the production

2697
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
in Slovenia,

2698
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and here,

2699
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
what we produce,

2700
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and what we do in the house,

2701
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
is that we cut the aluminum hair,

2702
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
then we have the laying

2703
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
of the components,

2704
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
the connection,

2705
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
the L-technique,

2706
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
which we also have in the warehouses,

2707
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and then we have the production,

2708
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
when it is all screwed together.

2709
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Now we will move

2710
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
to a new category,

2711
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
intimacy with Tomas,

2712
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and we will ask you, David,

2713
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
how do you come to this job,

2714
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
where did you start,

2715
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
and with this mix of simplicity

2716
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and goodwill, I guess,

2717
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
to enjoy where you start,

2718
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
how does young David find

2719
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the path,

2720
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
which he follows,

2721
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
to get to where he is today?

2722
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It is a very interesting story.

2723
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I have always been

2724
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
a programmer,

2725
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
and I also had,

2726
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
let's say, logical instincts,

2727
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and I was a bit weird,

2728
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I also had a lot of equations,

2729
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Now you are among yourself,

2730
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
a bit so weird.

2731
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
But then I said,

2732
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I will not go to the computer,

2733
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
because it is all programmed,

2734
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
a bit boring,

2735
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I will go to the L-technique,

2736
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
then I liked automatics,

2737
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
because it was so interesting,

2738
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
but I didn't like the connection either.

2739
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I mean, I found this automatics

2740
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
quite interesting,

2741
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I had it programmed a bit,

2742
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
it was great,

2743
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
but then again,

2744
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
what was in it for me?

2745
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I wanted to be a programmer,

2746
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
but not just a programmer,

2747
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I wanted to solve some engineering problems

2748
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
on a larger scale.

2749
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And then I was a bit on the side,

2750
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and it was a miracle,

2751
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
when I was working with a student

2752
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
for VESOL PICASIC,

2753
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
the Slovenian VESOL agency,

2754
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
when I was working with them,

2755
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
and also with DVSoft,

2756
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
when they were working with us,

2757
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and I said to myself,

2758
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
ok, I can work in transport,

2759
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
ok, a bit strange,

2760
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
but if they are working with us,

2761
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
something will work out.

2762
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Then I went to an interview,

2763
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I met DVSoft's chief forester,

2764
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Juret, and I found it quite interesting,

2765
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
what they were doing,

2766
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
it was the first impression,

2767
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I was like,

2768
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
ok, let's try,

2769
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
if it doesn't work,

2770
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
you can change it in half a year.

2771
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So I started working,

2772
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I was a software developer,

2773
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I was in automation,

2774
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I was also a bit in real-time,

2775
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and I thought,

2776
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
first of all,

2777
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
let's make some fixes,

2778
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
but then I thought,

2779
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
we can also work in real-time,

2780
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
so we came up with the idea

2781
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
to make some fixes

2782
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that work on the real-time

2783
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
e-tracket protocol,

2784
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
and I made one fix,

2785
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
and then there was a cool team,

2786
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and I think I was

2787
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
the most formal leader

2788
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
of that team,

2789
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
and that's how

2790
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
the company started,

2791
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
when I started,

2792
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
we were like 5-6 programmers,

2793
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
15 people,

2794
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Jure was a programmer,

2795
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and the current director was a programmer,

2796
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
and then we were growing,

2797
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and we could organize ourselves a bit differently,

2798
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and there were already

2799
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
a lot of things to develop,

2800
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and then I got my own team,

2801
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and then I started with that,

2802
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
ok, two teams,

2803
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
because sometimes I don't program

2804
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
more than 50% of the time,

2805
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
but I program 20% of the time,

2806
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and then maybe 10% of the time,

2807
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and then I started,

2808
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and I became a programmer,

2809
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I became an organizer,

2810
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and then I think

2811
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
at some point I decided,

2812
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
ok, now I have to decide

2813
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
if I'm going to become a programmer,

2814
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and then I dedicate myself to a team,

2815
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
and then maybe I'll be an architect,

2816
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
or I'll try

2817
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
to be in that

2818
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
big picture organization,

2819
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
because it will be interesting for me,

2820
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and it's also true that

2821
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I change a bit every now and then,

2822
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and if I'm already in the same service,

2823
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
it's good that I change a bit,

2824
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I don't know if you've noticed,

2825
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
every 5 years it changes,

2826
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and I'm enjoying the process,

2827
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'm trying to optimize the process,

2828
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
or that I have an influence

2829
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
on the fact that things are

2830
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
getting better and better,

2831
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
and then occasionally,

2832
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
as a leader,

2833
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
you have a little more power

2834
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
to change it,

2835
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
so I said, ok,

2836
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'll go into this leadership,

2837
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and I'll try to help,

2838
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and then, I think,

2839
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
3-4 years ago,

2840
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I somehow became a leader,

2841
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and then another colleague

2842
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
also became a leader.

2843
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Are you pissed off

2844
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
against your hierarchy?

2845
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Have you described yourself as pissed off?

2846
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
No, I don't think so.

2847
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Can I say something about that?

2848
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Now, when they give me

2849
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
one-on-one talks,

2850
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and summer talks,

2851
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
and feedback,

2852
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
they tell me,

2853
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
in the company,

2854
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
that we are, I don't know,

2855
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
it's a bit of a cliché,

2856
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
as you said, we have a flat structure,

2857
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
but for us,

2858
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
everyone can do anything,

2859
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
we have an open map,

2860
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I also believe in transparency,

2861
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and I think,

2862
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
this advantage, for me as a leader,

2863
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
is that I was a software developer

2864
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
before,

2865
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
and somehow, I know,

2866
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
how much you wanted to be a software developer,

2867
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
how much you wanted peace,

2868
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
how much you wanted to deal with a drama,

2869
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
how much you wanted some

2870
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
reasonable conditions,

2871
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
so that, for example,

2872
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
not every day, another task

2873
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
flies in.

2874
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So, in general, I think

2875
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I know how to make people happy,

2876
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and also, I don't know,

2877
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
if someone doesn't agree with me,

2878
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
that's the best thing for me,

2879
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
to hear another opinion,

2880
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
so we can talk, I don't know.

2881
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
What also helps,

2882
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and I can say for myself,

2883
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
is the high-end kitchen,

2884
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
the food is top.

2885
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Every time I was there,

2886
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I ate there, and...

2887
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
For Sava, Viljama liked it as well.

2888
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
They are not interested in me,

2889
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
except if David gives me

2890
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
other information.

2891
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Because you have two refrigerators,

2892
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
public and private, right?

2893
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Right, right.

2894
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
May I?

2895
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
No, no, you can continue.

2896
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
What, where do you cut corners

2897
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
on projects, if any?

2898
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Because I think...

2899
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I don't know where.

2900
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Every project has some constraints.

2901
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
If you don't know the other one,

2902
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
you always partner with someone else.

2903
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Okay, first of all,

2904
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
we're talking about bigger numbers,

2905
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
there's always a ceiling.

2906
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Where do you say, okay,

2907
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
let's focus more,

2908
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
let's put this aside.

2909
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You have to think through

2910
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
what the corner is.

2911
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
In this job, you have to be

2912
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
very pragmatic,

2913
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
you have to think through

2914
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
what is really worth.

2915
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You have to be careful not to get stuck

2916
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and not to invest too much energy.

2917
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
The reality is that

2918
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
if you want to have

2919
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
an ideal product,

2920
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
you would bankrupt it.

2921
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The corner is...

2922
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The beginning is very good,

2923
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
because it's your final goal.

2924
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Then, I would say,

2925
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
architecturally,

2926
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
you look at how you can

2927
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
achieve this goal

2928
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
with as little energy

2929
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
as possible,

2930
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
but at the same time,

2931
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
it's all a matter of persistence.

2932
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
We're not a startup,

2933
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
you can do something

2934
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
and in a month

2935
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
you'll be able to

2936
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
break all the code.

2937
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It's an engineering experience.

2938
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Those who were senior developers

2939
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
know, okay,

2940
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
this is good enough,

2941
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
and maybe this is the right thing to do.

2942
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Give me a specific example.

2943
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I don't know,

2944
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
is it a weaker version

2945
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
of some chips you choose,

2946
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
or less engineering hours,

2947
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
or is it reusability?

2948
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Give me a specific idea.

2949
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
For example,

2950
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I don't know,

2951
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
something like that.

2952
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
A chip that has a lot of tolerance,

2953
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
let's give it less tolerance.

2954
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
With components,

2955
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
you have some specifications,

2956
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
then you look for components

2957
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
that are within those specifications.

2958
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You don't want to take

2959
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
the best and most expensive component,

2960
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
because in the end,

2961
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
the product will be so expensive.

2962
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You look at what you want to achieve,

2963
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and then you look for

2964
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
what is possible for you.

2965
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But it's not about

2966
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
cutting corners,

2967
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
it's just about optimization.

2968
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
It's a good business practice.

2969
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Exactly.

2970
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I don't know,

2971
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
let's say,

2972
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
let's say it's a product,

2973
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
let's say,

2974
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
let's try to send it

2975
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
to the first page,

2976
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
which is still imperfect,

2977
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
so you get feedback first,

2978
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
and then you see what's missing.

2979
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I don't know,

2980
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
it's a bit of an agile theory,

2981
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
test early, test often.

2982
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You don't want

2983
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
a product to be packed,

2984
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
and then someone else does it,

2985
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and then you go out and see

2986
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
what they're doing.

2987
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Then you try to do something

2988
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
that's good enough

2989
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
for the page to say,

2990
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
OK, that's good,

2991
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
that's good,

2992
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and then you decide

2993
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
that there's a sequence

2994
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
where you can support it,

2995
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
and then send it to a page,

2996
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and then you support it in software,

2997
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and then you calibrate it,

2998
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and then, let's say,

2999
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
once it's missing,

3000
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
then it's time to visually

3001
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
look at all the links in the program.

3002
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And then you decide

3003
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
whether to send it all out,

3004
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
or not.

3005
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You have to know the price

3006
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
for a specific page.

3007
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
That's not important.

3008
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It's more important that you can

3009
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
test it a month in advance,

3010
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
even if the picture isn't healthy.

3011
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Tomas, you're doing well,

3012
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
but where do you cut corners?

3013
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
On the router?

3014
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Huh?

3015
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Nowhere.

3016
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
You haven't reached a financial peak.

3017
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
No, because we're turning

3018
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
into an investor's day,

3019
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
so I don't know where to start.

3020
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
No, we're practically

3021
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
at our level,

3022
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
because we're a startup,

3023
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and we're working on it

3024
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
with two and a half people,

3025
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and we're practically

3026
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
a fi-chip.

3027
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
For those of you who don't know,

3028
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
a fi-chip converts

3029
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
network data

3030
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
from electricity

3031
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
into bits,

3032
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
and we're a fi-chip.

3033
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
It took a lot of time,

3034
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
because the best

3035
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
are considered by

3036
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Marvel,

3037
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
but a gigabit Marvel chip

3038
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
is $15 for a nobody

3039
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
like me,

3040
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
who starts from scratch

3041
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and almost orders a mouse.

3042
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It's $15,

3043
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and if you look around,

3044
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
you see that Max Linear

3045
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
bought the IP from Intel,

3046
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
so Intel's fi-chips,

3047
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
which have been in production for 20 years,

3048
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
are like $0.80

3049
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
versus $15.

3050
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
But watch this,

3051
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
what's worse

3052
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
is that they have

3053
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
better specifications

3054
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and more features

3055
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
for $0.80 versus $15 from Marvel.

3056
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But Marvel has

3057
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
this reputation,

3058
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
so they're nothing better or worse

3059
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
than Intel.

3060
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Branding.

3061
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And they all know each other.

3062
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I mean, I don't think

3063
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
we need to compare with Ubisoft.

3064
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Not even close.

3065
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Not even 10-15 years.

3066
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But, you know,

3067
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
because we're a nobody,

3068
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
you see,

3069
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
we have a frame that's not

3070
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
as good as the one we have now,

3071
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and it's only 30%.

3072
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I don't know,

3073
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
the price of a board is $60,

3074
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
but the frame is higher.

3075
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
For us, it's like this.

3076
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
For example,

3077
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
if you're measuring

3078
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
why someone would take

3079
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
a very thin resistor,

3080
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
which is important

3081
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
for measuring,

3082
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
if you can calibrate it

3083
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
and compensate it,

3084
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
then you can,

3085
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
for example,

3086
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
make it darker.

3087
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Or similar,

3088
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
you have these blocks

3089
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
that are less thin.

3090
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
In the end,

3091
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
for the user,

3092
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
the clock will be very thin,

3093
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
because you will adjust it.

3094
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Or in electrotechnics,

3095
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
we have this classic software

3096
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
debouncing of buttons.

3097
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
If you have a button,

3098
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
if you press it,

3099
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
if it doesn't have a capacitor,

3100
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
it will blink a little,

3101
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and then in the software

3102
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
you see how many times

3103
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
the button has been pressed.

3104
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
In the software,

3105
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
the first time the button is pressed,

3106
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
it's pressed every millisecond,

3107
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and there's one button.

3108
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Also, if you're measuring

3109
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
the temperature at home,

3110
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and you're interested in 0.5°C,

3111
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
then you need to measure

3112
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
10,000 times per second

3113
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
at 0.001°C.

3114
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I wouldn't be willing

3115
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
to invest $100,000 for that.

3116
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It's important to be able to

3117
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
measure through your ass,

3118
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
how many times you can press a button.

3119
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Now I have a little spotlight

3120
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
in front of the listeners

3121
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
from your team.

3122
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Why DvSoft?

3123
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Not as a supplier,

3124
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
but why would I,

3125
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
as a partner,

3126
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
invest in you,

3127
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
instead of competitors?

3128
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
That's a good question.

3129
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
As I said before,

3130
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I personally believe

3131
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
that our products are the best,

3132
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and that we have a big advantage

3133
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
when it comes to both

3134
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
hardware and software.

3135
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Let's go back to the example

3136
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
that I like the most,

3137
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Apple.

3138
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
If you work on both hardware and software,

3139
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
you have more options

3140
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
in your hands,

3141
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and you can optimize more things.

3142
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I don't know how the hardware

3143
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
behaves, but if you have software,

3144
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
you have a lot of options

3145
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
to optimize it.

3146
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
For example,

3147
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
what we are better at

3148
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
than our competitors,

3149
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
is that a user

3150
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
takes our hardware and

3151
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
measures it.

3152
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
It can be done very quickly.

3153
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
For example, we just measured something,

3154
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
and then again, when you

3155
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
press a button,

3156
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
you can see

3157
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
the results.

3158
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It's very fast.

3159
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It's very fast.

3160
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
to do tests for cars.

3161
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I don't know, for example,

3162
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
with competition you can

3163
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
use it for a day or two, right?

3164
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
For us, for example, for the same rites,

3165
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
we used, I don't know, two hours

3166
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
to be able to record all these things.

3167
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Because it's not software, I will say,

3168
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
really, when we work together with partners,

3169
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I will say that it is,

3170
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
in my opinion, the most user-friendly

3171
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
of all softwares.

3172
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Then I will say,

3173
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
a few more bonbons,

3174
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
that we have easy resolution,

3175
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
that we are more precise,

3176
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
and that we are more precisely

3177
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
synchronized as a competitor.

3178
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
But I would say that,

3179
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
yes, this whole thing,

3180
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
one more big thing,

3181
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
that with us you can really

3182
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
measure everything,

3183
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and you have, I will say,

3184
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
you also have, when you get data,

3185
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
not only can you visualize

3186
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
in thousands of ways,

3187
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
but then you also have the opportunity

3188
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and then in the analysis

3189
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and you can decode

3190
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and analyze how the engine works,

3191
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
you can, I don't know,

3192
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
give FFT, because, for example,

3193
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
with the competition it is so that

3194
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
you have specialized programs

3195
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
where you can, for example,

3196
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
do only one of these things,

3197
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
then you can export the data

3198
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
to another program and do it there.

3199
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So, I will say,

3200
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
we have the most user-friendly

3201
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
software.

3202
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
It's a bit weird, as you thought.

3203
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Otherwise, compared to others,

3204
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
it pays extra for one more program.

3205
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Yes, yes, yes.

3206
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
It is also the case that,

3207
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
as you said, they are specialized

3208
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
for one of these measures,

3209
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and you can get

3210
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
from those sensors that we talked about,

3211
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
you can get touch, you can get

3212
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
some kind of camera, everything,

3213
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
you can do a lot of things.

3214
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Now, these things,

3215
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
which are also tricky,

3216
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
because they are all over the world,

3217
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
behind the Chinese firewall,

3218
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
in the USA,

3219
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
in Canada, which is also in the USA,

3220
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
now, in the end,

3221
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
they made it, right?

3222
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And now AlphaGornic Software made it,

3223
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
and there are spaces there,

3224
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and it's been there for 10 years.

3225
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
And how do you update it?

3226
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Does someone come with a USB key?

3227
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I mean, does it hurt a lot?

3228
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Yes, it really hurts.

3229
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Pleasant?

3230
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I mean,

3231
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
as I told you,

3232
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
in our industry,

3233
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
there are also those

3234
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
parties that are very careful

3235
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
where they have those measures

3236
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that they do.

3237
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I mean, there have always been,

3238
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
but there will always be this security problem.

3239
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And yes, it can happen

3240
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
that these measures are made

3241
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
entirely in some hall or building,

3242
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
where there is no internet,

3243
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
no wire,

3244
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and in fact,

3245
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
no one has access to it.

3246
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I can tell you an anecdote

3247
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
when I was a junior developer,

3248
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
and I was on one side,

3249
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
and I took the key,

3250
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
and I said, OK, let's update it,

3251
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and I gave it to the computer,

3252
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
and then, the whole panic,

3253
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
they took the key from me,

3254
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and I didn't have the key in my hand anymore,

3255
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and I didn't give it back.

3256
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
So it's very,

3257
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I'll say, yes, it's hard to update.

3258
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It's like, I'll say,

3259
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
maybe it's a little different,

3260
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
that on one side, where I'll say,

3261
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
measures are being made,

3262
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
a lot of decisions are made,

3263
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
let's set an example,

3264
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
that these measures are being made,

3265
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
our scenario is being made,

3266
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I also know if there are any problems,

3267
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I know where the problems are,

3268
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'll set an example.

3269
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And again, it depends.

3270
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
There are also some,

3271
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I don't know,

3272
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
and you, you don't even know

3273
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
how to update it,

3274
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
it's their thing,

3275
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
we don't talk to you about it.

3276
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Interesting.

3277
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
When we're talking about updates,

3278
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
what do they do at the end of the cycle?

3279
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
For example,

3280
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
why does the machine work for 8 years,

3281
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
and then stop?

3282
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Why doesn't the machine have to do something?

3283
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
All the chips are,

3284
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
let's say, silica,

3285
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
and the plastic components

3286
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
don't rot, I'd say.

3287
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Why can't this device

3288
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
fly for 30 years?

3289
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You know what causes

3290
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
aging of the electrical components,

3291
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
which is death.

3292
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Heat?

3293
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Really, yes.

3294
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
The more you make it,

3295
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
the older the components get,

3296
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and over time,

3297
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
their characteristics get worse.

3298
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's always, over time,

3299
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
worse,

3300
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
and the lifespan of the components

3301
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
is reduced.

3302
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So, I'd say,

3303
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
in the end,

3304
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
the lifespan is long.

3305
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
As I mentioned earlier,

3306
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
we have a 7-year warranty,

3307
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
and it can only grow to,

3308
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I don't know, 15 years.

3309
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I don't want to

3310
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
optimize it,

3311
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
and say,

3312
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
we want to make a 7-year warranty,

3313
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
so we can do it for 8 years.

3314
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
If I stop now,

3315
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
then the other party,

3316
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
who has a 17-year warranty,

3317
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
will send me condensers.

3318
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I'd say the same.

3319
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Even if they have a 15-year warranty,

3320
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and it's not working,

3321
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
they can still send me a series,

3322
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
and if it works, I'll try to fix it.

3323
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
The law.

3324
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Let's see,

3325
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
if there's anything else.

3326
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
What else do you do,

3327
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
since you're not in the service?

3328
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Sorry, when are you not in the service?

3329
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I'm not in the service.

3330
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I'd say,

3331
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
last year, my main hobby

3332
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
is singing, if I'm honest.

3333
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I don't know,

3334
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I had so many other hobbies,

3335
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
from, I don't know,

3336
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
playing chess.

3337
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I played chess before.

3338
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I used to play swing,

3339
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
but now I have less time.

3340
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I used to travel a lot.

3341
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
That's still going on.

3342
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I'd say,

3343
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
now that I have a small child,

3344
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I'd say,

3345
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
the state of these worlds

3346
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
is becoming more relaxed.

3347
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I might have a service,

3348
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
an interesting trip.

3349
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I'd be like that boss,

3350
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
who sends me around the world.

3351
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I don't need to be there,

3352
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I just need to be there.

3353
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
That's great.

3354
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I'd say,

3355
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
it's great that developers

3356
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
have a website,

3357
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
where you can

3358
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
go to any website.

3359
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
It's different

3360
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
when you see your instruments

3361
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
and software.

3362
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I don't know,

3363
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
when you go to a shooting range

3364
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
or a race track,

3365
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
it's a different feeling.

3366
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Tell me,

3367
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
are you shocked

3368
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
when you see

3369
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
this?

3370
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
One thing that surprised me,

3371
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and it came out of nowhere,

3372
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
is that I'm going to talk

3373
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
about Vesovian genes.

3374
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
A year ago, I found out

3375
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
that they have these caves

3376
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
with the first pictures in France.

3377
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
You have pictures there,

3378
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and I don't know

3379
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
if 100 people a year can visit

3380
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
these caves.

3381
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
You need permission to see it,

3382
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
to protect yourself.

3383
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I was also surprised

3384
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
by the environment

3385
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
with our instruments.

3386
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
For example,

3387
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I was also surprised

3388
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and I'm interested

3389
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
in my next trip

3390
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
to Disneyland.

3391
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
They're already testing

3392
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
some of our products.

3393
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
They invited me to come

3394
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and see what their

3395
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
back-end Disneyland looks like.

3396
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Free Disneyland.

3397
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I can hear that.

3398
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Are we going to have

3399
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
hardware fairs in Slovenia

3400
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
in the near future?

3401
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Because that means

3402
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
we're going to spend

3403
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
a lot of time at home.

3404
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I don't know.

3405
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I think we'll get more

3406
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
when they have a bigger kitchen.

3407
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
They have months of work.

3408
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Let's talk about months.

3409
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I think we're also

3410
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
sponsors of the city of Slovenia.

3411
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
We also include events

3412
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
if we don't know

3413
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
where the seeds are in the world.

3414
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And we also include them.

3415
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I also introduced

3416
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
an instrument

3417
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
that can be transported.

3418
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
That's the difference

3419
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
between the software industry

3420
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
and the proper industry.

3421
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
What?

3422
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Are we doing pick-ups?

3423
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
We're doing pick-ups.

3424
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I have a question.

3425
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I have a suggestion.

3426
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
You might say,

3427
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
why didn't you ask me?

3428
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I studied that

3429
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
you could ask

3430
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
and you could answer.

3431
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
But maybe we didn't.

3432
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I often get questions

3433
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
about ADC transformers.

3434
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
It's more interesting

3435
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
because it's an interesting project.

3436
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Go ahead.

3437
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Plan B.

3438
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
ADC is...

3439
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
No, I know.

3440
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Isn't it a band?

3441
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Also.

3442
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
ADC is a band?

3443
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
ADC.

3444
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
ACDC.

3445
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Oh my God.

3446
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
No, it's not quantization.

3447
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Say something else.

3448
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Maybe one of my experiences.

3449
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
A few years ago,

3450
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
maybe it's also a part

3451
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
of the Fellers' group,

3452
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
we sold

3453
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
to Nikola's company.

3454
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
These are some cars.

3455
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
They were making these engines

3456
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
and they were making

3457
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
what's it called?

3458
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Self-driving?

3459
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I think so.

3460
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I don't know what

3461
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
the differentiation was.

3462
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
We sold them some equipment

3463
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
in bigger packages.

3464
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Then they put

3465
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
the equipment together

3466
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
in a more innovative way.

3467
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
For example,

3468
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
in Phoenix,

3469
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
they made a test space

3470
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
to test their engine.

3471
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Then they started the tests.

3472
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
When they put it together,

3473
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
nothing worked.

3474
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Again, it's an expensive thing.

3475
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I don't know how much it costs.

3476
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I think it's more than

3477
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
$100,000 per day.

3478
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
There was a panic.

3479
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Why doesn't it work?

3480
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I didn't work on it consciously.

3481
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Then they said,

3482
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
OK, I made some of them,

3483
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
then I said, David,

3484
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
maybe you should go and see

3485
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
what they think and solve this problem.

3486
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Then I said, OK, we'll buy a car.

3487
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
We went together

3488
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
and covered the whole space.

3489
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Then we put it together.

3490
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
When I got it,

3491
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I still didn't know

3492
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
if it would really work or not.

3493
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Fortunately, it worked.

3494
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Then we came to Phoenix.

3495
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Fortunately, we were young,

3496
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
so it was only 40 degrees.

3497
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
It was dry air.

3498
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I think it was so hot.

3499
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
We came there

3500
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and somehow managed

3501
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
to convince our local CS

3502
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
to take care

3503
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
of the main project manager.

3504
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
The project manager

3505
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
also looked very enthusiastic

3506
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
that I wouldn't be able to do anything.

3507
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Even when we got there,

3508
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
it was like this.

3509
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
One screwdriver and 300 engineers

3510
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
jumping around it.

3511
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Each one was screwing a small part.

3512
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
We were there.

3513
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I was working there.

3514
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Every 3-4 hours

3515
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
we had a time slot

3516
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
of 5 minutes

3517
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
in the creator's cabin

3518
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
to try to debug

3519
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
what he was doing.

3520
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
The first thing

3521
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
was that they connected

3522
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
everything together.

3523
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Then they asked me

3524
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
to do 2-3 things in the same combination.

3525
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Then I was working

3526
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
in the same garage.

3527
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
We were programming a bit.

3528
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It was quite interesting.

3529
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It was late at night.

3530
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
We were programming.

3531
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
We were testing

3532
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
how it works.

3533
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
We had 5 minutes to test

3534
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
what works and what doesn't.

3535
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Then we repeated the cycle.

3536
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
We were lucky

3537
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
that we were also connected

3538
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
to Slovenia.

3539
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I would say that those time zones

3540
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
are very useful.

3541
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
When Slovenians

3542
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
finish their work,

3543
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
they can start

3544
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
the next day.

3545
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
That combination worked well.

3546
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
We were working

3547
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
for 4-5 days a day.

3548
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It was interesting

3549
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
because there were

3550
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Bosch engineers.

3551
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I think they were

3552
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
from Chbk.

3553
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Everyone was flying around.

3554
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
There was panic.

3555
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I don't know if you know

3556
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
how it works.

3557
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
You have to test

3558
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
everything to see

3559
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
how well it works.

3560
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It was also interesting

3561
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
to see the results

3562
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
and what they measured.

3563
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I think they were nervous

3564
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
because of the panic.

3565
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
We solved

3566
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
the problem in 4-5 days.

3567
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
In the end,

3568
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
the project manager

3569
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
was really satisfied.

3570
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
He was surprised

3571
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
and said

3572
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
that we will start

3573
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
with a project manager.

3574
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
The manager

3575
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
was a wonderful guy.

3576
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
He said that he will

3577
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
fix it in half a year.

3578
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
We solved it in 5 days.

3579
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
In the end,

3580
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
everything worked out.

3581
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Maybe it was a walk around.

3582
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
But in the end,

3583
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
everything worked out.

3584
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It was a success story.

3585
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It was interesting.

3586
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
It was an extreme challenge,

3587
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
but it was interesting.

3588
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Do you know what was the problem?

3589
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
They turned it off,

3590
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
but they didn't turn it back on.

3591
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I had an idea

3592
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
to make only 32.

3593
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
They put together 45

3594
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
and I constantly changed it.

3595
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
But in the end,

3596
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
it was in half a year.

3597
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I have one last question.

3598
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Are you ready?

3599
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Very important.

3600
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
What is a grenadier march?

3601
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
This will surprise me.

3602
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I will be very nervous.

3603
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I can tell you.

3604
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I will give you a correct answer.

3605
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Then I can tell you my opinion.

3606
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
A grenadier march

3607
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
is when you have

3608
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
potatoes,

3609
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
which is really good.

3610
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Then you have pasta.

3611
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I have a lot of pasta.

3612
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Then you have pasta.

3613
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
A grenadier march is

3614
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
when you put it together

3615
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and you are worried

3616
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
that the pasta is overcooked.

3617
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I found it.

3618
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Tomas thought it was a good kitchen.

3619
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It is.

3620
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I have to try it.

3621
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It is a speciality.

3622
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
With a grenadier march

3623
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
we end this episode.

3624
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Thank you all for listening.

3625
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Thank you David.

3626
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Thank you Tomas.

3627
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Thank you to our supporters.

3628
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
See you next time.

3629
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Take care.

3630
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Bye.
