1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In the next episode

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:21,000
Greetings, this is the third season, fourth season, fourth season, fourth, four, four.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Not four, three?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No, four, four.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Four, four.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Four, three?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, four, three.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Four, three?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ok, four, three.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
All by one error.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, all by one error.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Again, a slightly different episode.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is a joke that we had in our hands,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
where we are making some kind of connection.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Podcasts with beer makers,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and a podcast in the garden.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then we said that this is a square versus a full square.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The idea is that, on the other hand,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
lovers of technology and the law

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
have joined forces with beer makers,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and we, technology,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
drink in the middle.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, one story with beer.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We decided last, I think, second season

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to make a podcast with alcohol.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a no-go.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We have very poor experience,

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so we decided to do it again.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Before we give you a talk,

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to introduce yourself,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you have to tell us what you drank today.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What did I drink?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
First, a disclaimer that the Minister of Health warns

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that we should not drink alcohol.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Just one glass.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You know what's inside.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Cheers to the Minister of Health.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can tell you later,

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that this disclaimer is really important.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was a declaration of alcohol users.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes, I don't know if it's still a declaration,

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but yes, especially for me.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think we also have it as a podcast.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you say that the garden is a hobby,

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and then podcasting is a hobby,

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think you have to declare it as a hobby.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't think so.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But let's go back.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What we have here in the garden

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is a former workbench.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It was a daily printer for work.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now it's a tectonic brewery.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
They also have their own brewery,

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Tectonics.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Then they have beer,

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
which they brew here,

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which they call open league,

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
which are smaller series,

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
or test series.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Today we have something ultra-special,

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
simply a black IPA,

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
black IPA,

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
which has 6.3 volumes of alcohol.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The photo was brought to us

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
by the owner of the brewery.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And that's it.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing special.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I wanted to take goats and sheep,

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but they said they didn't have

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
enough beer for that many people.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I was like, okay,

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
give us something to drink.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So that's it.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are we recording now?

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How do you two start?

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
First of all,

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
long live Žiga.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And long live Andraža.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, long live Andraža.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We are Petar and Žiga,

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
two goats,

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because I'm Petar,

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and he's a goat.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're doing a podcast,

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
P na Kvadrat,

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
where Andraž talks about

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
our technological favorite topics

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and law,

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
law and technology,

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and, of course, beer.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because we handle alcohol,

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
not the podcast.

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So that's what we do.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And as a colleague from FACS,

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm an advisor to Žiga,

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and CryptoSveto.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What do you do, Žiga?

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm a kind of an operations lead

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
at Block Analytica,

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and we work on various solutions

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
for the field of financial

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
investment,

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so deep in the financial world.

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's it.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So,

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is it a pure

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
kind of law?

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is it a sub-category?

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is it very narrowly

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
directed?

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, I think

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
the law is very divided.

114
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If you start from the very beginning,

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
very technically,

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
theoretically,

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
there are probably a few areas,

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
economic, civil, legal, and so on.

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then you have the majority,

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and I don't know how you

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
divide it in the office,

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but you also have the industry,

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
where you cover more areas.

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So you can say,

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
for example, that you deal

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
with pharmaceuticals,

127
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
then everything from IP

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
to international agreements,

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to health regulation,

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and so on.

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's how I would say.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's something you probably

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
have to learn by yourself,

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but it's not something

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
that the faculty gives you.

136
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No, no.

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's the same as for us.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I mean, through practice and work.

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Front-end, back-end,

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
DevOps, SRE,

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and so on.

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Whether you do CRM,

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
streaming,

144
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
various fun scientific videos,

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
or other problems.

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's it.

147
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Software, hardware,

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
no very informatica.

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No very informatica, yes.

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We are electronics.

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Anyway, let's first say hello.

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Welcome,

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
let's say,

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to the creation of a joint podcast.

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's say hello.

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A quick greeting.

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I hope the mic is working.

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Good stuff.

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How is it?

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Fantastic.

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I must admit,

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not a big fan of black pears,

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
because they are too sweet.

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But black apples are great,

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
because you have a dark soul,

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
but at the same time

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
it's very tasty,

168
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
because it's an apple.

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's more ethical.

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes, this is great.

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Not too bitter,

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
good for the body.

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Shall we start?

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's start.

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everyone in the city,

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
when they see

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that we are starting a podcast,

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
they say,

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
why are you doing this?

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know,

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
how did you start it,

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
for a long time,

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
or did you feel

184
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the need

185
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to share

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
with others?

187
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm a classic man of fair podcast,

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you feel like a man who needs it.

189
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your opinion is the most important thing in the world.

190
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It started

191
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
when we went to Pyr,

192
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
near Tektonik.

193
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was a teacher there,

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
but I didn't take it seriously,

195
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
because I drank too much,

196
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
then I suffered,

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and then I thought

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
about Tektonik.

199
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know,

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
when we were at Pyr,

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
it wasn't just a debate

202
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
about home, work, etc.

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We talked about legal and technological issues,

204
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and we thought

205
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
it would be fun to do a podcast.

206
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That was the start.

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Then we started

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to progress,

209
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and now

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
relatively well.

211
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's been a month and a half or two,

212
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
because we are both awake.

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And now

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you have

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
a community

216
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
of colleagues

217
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
who are in the same field,

218
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
enthusiasts who follow you.

219
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I would say yes.

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What I really like

221
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
about this podcast format is

222
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that you don't have to

223
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
look for feedback.

224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If people don't come,

225
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
they comment.

226
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
For example, what you do,

227
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you have Discord,

228
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
which is great,

229
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
because you have more debate

230
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and more personality.

231
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But yes,

232
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think we have some good listeners,

233
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
everyone who gets feedback.

234
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Of course, the feedback

235
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
was via e-mail,

236
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
or also on the street,

237
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
or business-wise.

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Like, hey, Zančevi is a good podcast.

239
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes, it's more like that.

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
E-mail is pretty rare.

241
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't know how many people

242
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
want to record with him.

243
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No, not you.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But that's more for

245
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
after podcast.

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, but I want to say

247
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that he is alive,

248
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't know what his colleagues

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
are doing, if I'm not mistaken.

250
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He told me, hey,

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I listen to it very well,

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and it's interesting to listen

253
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to my lawyers,

254
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and IT people.

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You get what you have,

256
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
those two extremes.

257
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's like a cross between them.

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, it's interesting

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
when someone you don't expect

260
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
says, hey, it's a good podcast.

261
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And you listen to it.

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Our story is

263
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
very similar.

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
At some point,

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
in the coworking,

266
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
one of our

267
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
voice actors

268
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
had a coffee,

269
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and then the first episode

270
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
came out.

271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And we put it out.

272
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
With what purpose?

273
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then we talked about it.

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But is it like that

275
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
in the legal circles?

276
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Where are the lawyers?

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
At the meet-ups.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Was it like

279
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the first shift

280
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and you had to change

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
which side you had the most problems with?

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How does it look like?

283
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
At the meet-ups,

284
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
there are different events,

285
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and those variants,

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
for example, the 19th school

287
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
in April.

288
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The older you are,

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the more fun it is to see your colleagues from FACS.

290
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Those events,

291
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know,

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
different conferences,

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
those are the closest

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to a meet-up.

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And you have more of a crypto meet-up.

296
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes, I was

297
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
coming from the point of view

298
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that podcast is a good way

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
to translate

300
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
serendipity

301
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
in English.

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a bit random,

303
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
but you get into it

304
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and realize that maybe someone

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
will come to me with the same interests.

306
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Maybe I will meet someone

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and he will teach me something

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and I will learn something from him.

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's similar to a meet-up,

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
but there is too much

311
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
one-way communication.

312
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
When it comes to meet-ups,

313
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
there are not that many.

314
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't know,

315
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
conferences are more like

316
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
very professional events.

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think that in the developer world,

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
there is a lot of it.

319
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can show your solutions.

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, we are more like middle schoolers.

321
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
All of my colleagues

322
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
from FACS

323
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
are more or less the same age as me,

324
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
but I think that there is always

325
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
someone higher up on the podium.

326
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There can't be a meet-up.

327
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There are a lot of things

328
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
that can't be shared.

329
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And now we are going to show

330
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
how we solved it.

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, we are very confident about it.

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Does it help

333
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to be transparent?

334
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It depends

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
on the context.

336
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
For example,

337
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
transparency.

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Most of the meetings

339
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
are publicly announced.

340
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a legal debate

341
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
whether to publish

342
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
all the meetings

343
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
publicly.

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think that

345
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
it's not a problem for the society.

346
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's not digitalized.

347
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
For example,

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
when people talk about AI,

349
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
where do you first scan

350
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
all the data?

351
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that it can be shared.

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Transparency

353
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
would help

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
the society

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to understand

356
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
how the sausage is made.

357
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What's going on behind the scenes?

358
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why do some things

359
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
last as long as others?

360
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's my biggest criticism.

361
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why does it last so long?

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because you have some hands.

363
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
For example,

364
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you have 30 days to answer

365
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
a question.

366
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you haven't answered

367
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in 30 days,

368
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you can answer in 45 days.

369
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's logical

370
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to give people time

371
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to prepare.

372
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Is this time

373
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
used up?

374
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do we have a buffer

375
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to take this time?

376
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Are we so busy

377
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that the government

378
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
thinks that they are

379
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
taking their time?

380
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is there so much backlog

381
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
that they can't

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
share everything?

383
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's my question.

384
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It depends on the court.

385
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Some have so much backlog

386
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
that they don't follow it.

387
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think that the court

388
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
has a lot of backlog.

389
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Some courts have to solve

390
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
the backlog.

391
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's one aspect.

392
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The other aspect is

393
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
the rules.

394
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You have 30 days

395
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
to answer a question.

396
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If they put you in jail

397
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
on 100 pages,

398
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
you'll get a fine.

399
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But most things

400
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
are simple.

401
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You can answer

402
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
in advance.

403
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But the organization

404
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and the court

405
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
work in triage.

406
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You don't have to do it first.

407
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I like that.

408
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's the same for me.

409
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think that people

410
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
go to the court

411
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
or to the health center

412
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and ask to open the file

413
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and see the backlog.

414
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You work in triage anyway.

415
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you're in jail and you don't do 5 things,

416
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
what will you do first?

417
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We have the advantage

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that there is

419
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
mostly a digital background.

420
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There is very little

421
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
physical image in a paper

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
or in a magazine.

423
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's why we don't know how to write.

424
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I agree.

425
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
People always carry it in a suitcase.

426
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, in a suitcase.

427
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's physical,

428
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but it's written communication.

429
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know how many of you

430
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
have the experience.

431
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Theoretically,

432
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
it's possible

433
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to insert an electronic decision.

434
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's so difficult

435
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that it's easy to print and insert.

436
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It wouldn't be a UX designer

437
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to check it

438
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
because of the simplicity.

439
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You don't have to click

440
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
for every file you upload.

441
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Then you have a ruler

442
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
that tells you that every application

443
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
has to be a selected file.

444
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Then you have this application

445
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
that tells you the date,

446
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
click, sign,

447
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and so on.

448
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I uploaded a vlog for 5 hours

449
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and I had to insert

450
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
at least 200 files.

451
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In such situations,

452
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I print and insert.

453
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's easier for me.

454
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Is it a web interface?

455
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes, it is.

456
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why didn't you decide

457
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to offer it?

458
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It would be nice if I offered it.

459
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In general,

460
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
if there was

461
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
a digitization

462
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
of the legal system,

463
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
would it help

464
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
or solve

465
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
something?

466
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Would it speed up

467
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the process?

468
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I can tell you

469
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that recently

470
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I was at an event

471
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
where there was

472
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
a meeting

473
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in which 10 pages

474
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
of the meeting

475
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
could be submitted

476
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to the court.

477
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The court had to copy

478
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the meeting.

479
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I uploaded it physically,

480
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but then I ordered a USB key

481
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that I brought to the court

482
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
in ODT format.

483
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I already clicked

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
so that it wouldn't be you.

485
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It was very nice.

486
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If there was an electronic system

487
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
in which 10 pages could be printed

488
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
by hand,

489
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
it would be helpful.

490
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Now we solved it.

491
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm glad

492
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
that the whole country

493
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
is talking about digitalization

494
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and AI.

495
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can have data first.

496
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you don't have

497
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
digitalized data,

498
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
what does AI help you with?

499
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I will pull it out of my pants.

500
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I will hallucinate

501
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
when I see this room

502
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
from 10 years ago.

503
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We will talk about these topics

504
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
on the podcast.

505
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I like the gaming geeky topics

506
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the most.

507
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm happy to hear

508
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
that you are involved.

509
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I learn things from him.

510
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't understand this world.

511
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He does.

512
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm interested in

513
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
crypto

514
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and how it can be

515
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
regulated.

516
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And then

517
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
it comes into the game.

518
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
In the sense of

519
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
working on the side of regulation

520
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
or protecting

521
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
the end users.

522
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What are

523
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
the biggest legal challenges?

524
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I think it's everything.

525
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Maybe it's interesting

526
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that America is going in a different direction.

527
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
With Trump.

528
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
My personal opinion is

529
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that it can be very good or very bad.

530
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We will see in the next

531
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
mandates.

532
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
In Europe, we went

533
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
to regulate everything

534
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
with stable coins

535
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and so on.

536
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think

537
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
there are more things

538
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
that can be done legally.

539
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You can be on the side of regulators

540
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
or companies that

541
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
allow you to

542
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
break through

543
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
the mess of regulations.

544
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Plus, to not run into

545
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
something else.

546
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You have some financial regulation

547
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
depending on the decision you make.

548
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I've been in this since 2017

549
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and at that time

550
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
there were a lot of things

551
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
that were not clear.

552
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't think

553
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that more or less

554
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
work has been done.

555
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Do you think we are moving

556
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
to a better direction?

557
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I mean, if you

558
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
manage the work

559
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
in the same way,

560
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
is it changing to a better direction?

561
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes, I would say so.

562
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because

563
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
you have a clearer picture

564
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
of what is possible and what is not.

565
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
At that time, we were just doing something new.

566
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It was similar to this and similar to that.

567
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You could see the evil.

568
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You relied on

569
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
things that were similar.

570
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't know,

571
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you approached regulators,

572
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
you approached other industries

573
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and nobody could tell you anything.

574
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Now you have a framework

575
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that you can stick to.

576
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Now you have to make an assessment yourself.

577
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Does it fall apart?

578
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Does it fall apart?

579
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Are you regulated?

580
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It seems to me that

581
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
crypto is so specific that

582
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
there are still

583
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
a lot of things that are not regulated.

584
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Although they have already been regulated a lot.

585
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There are still

586
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
European NFTs.

587
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It is regulated.

588
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Meme coins.

589
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The whole decentralized finance system

590
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
is also very dependent.

591
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So, yes.

592
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
As you mentioned

593
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
EU versus Europe.

594
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I would say that

595
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
in Europe,

596
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
we are going to regulate everything.

597
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We are going to set some laws

598
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
for all areas.

599
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And then

600
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
some

601
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
breakthrough in Europe

602
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
with technological fairs

603
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
or some

604
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
knowledge.

605
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Some start-ups would create

606
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
a lot of things.

607
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It seems to me that

608
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
this regulation is pushing us

609
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
to start outside of Europe.

610
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
How do you see this?

611
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Is it too deep

612
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
for a start?

613
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
No, it is not too deep for a start.

614
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I also ask myself

615
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
these questions.

616
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If we go straight to MICO,

617
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
the regulation for cryptocurrencies,

618
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
in defense of regulation,

619
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
for example,

620
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
is better.

621
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
If you are a member of a state,

622
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and you are in the

623
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Crypto Asset Service Provider,

624
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
then you know

625
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
that it will be the same in the whole EU.

626
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Similarly,

627
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
for financial instruments,

628
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
you sell shares or whatever.

629
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If you are licensed in one state,

630
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you can also passport

631
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
to another state.

632
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Which is great,

633
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
because you have a bigger market

634
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and you can do it easily.

635
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Of course, it is difficult

636
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
if the regulation is too fast

637
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
without...

638
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I would say that it is not too fast

639
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
for crypto, but for example

640
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
for AI-Activ,

641
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
which is potentially

642
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
enchanted.

643
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
With AI-Activ,

644
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
it is still a risk-based system.

645
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What we want and what we don't.

646
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
For example, it is already limited

647
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that AI will not be able

648
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to make a decision.

649
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Thank God!

650
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
In the US, there are garbage-in-garbage-out

651
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
problems,

652
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
which were used

653
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
to determine what is the maximum penalty.

654
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Ten years ago,

655
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
some EU systems

656
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
were taking more penalties.

657
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Why? Because the data was like that.

658
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know.

659
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I am not interested in it.

660
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There is still a dilemma

661
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
whether the EU is a unicorn or not.

662
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes, in the US it is.

663
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It is a different

664
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
side of the debate.

665
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What does it mean for the economy

666
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
as a whole?

667
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I would say that the average quality of life

668
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
in the EU is still much higher than in the US.

669
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Will unicorns solve it or not?

670
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But yes, I agree.

671
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Maybe it is because

672
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
most people

673
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
with

674
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
better

675
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and higher

676
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
income

677
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
are less connected

678
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
to the EU.

679
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Maybe.

680
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yes, maybe.

681
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I don't know.

682
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I think it is a bit difficult

683
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
because the biggest

684
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
technology

685
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
like Spotify,

686
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Skype, etc.

687
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We have SAP,

688
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and the exception

689
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
is ASML.

690
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It is a huge capitalization.

691
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I think we are like that.

692
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
In Europe and the US we have two different approaches.

693
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
They are like

694
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
risk on, leverage,

695
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
we employ thousands of people

696
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and even if they disappear in a day, it is OK.

697
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
In Europe we are like

698
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
ten people a year,

699
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
then ten more,

700
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
then a bank loan.

701
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I think we should

702
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
regulate

703
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
more in Europe,

704
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
more risk on

705
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
in the US.

706
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
How to change it?

707
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We could be a bit

708
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
behind.

709
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But

710
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
how can you be behind

711
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
if you don't have capital,

712
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
if you don't have a data system?

713
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and then, of course, those who are more inclined to go to America,

714
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
those who are not, maybe, well, let's give Europe a credit.

715
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They have a lot of

716
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
don't ask for permission,

717
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
ask for forgiveness,

718
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
which is also indicated by the AI,

719
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
they have parsed the whole internet.

720
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes, yes.

721
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And what about that?

722
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It would be ironic for me

723
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
if this OpenAI

724
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
criticized DeepSeek

725
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that they violated their copyright

726
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and I thought, oh, really?

727
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But

728
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I, for example,

729
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
GDPR,

730
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
which is a public organization in the field of personal data,

731
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
they criticize it a lot,

732
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
but a lot of developers, I know,

733
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
who criticized it, I would like this project to be

734
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
based on personal data, okay, I agree,

735
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but the logic is

736
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
privacy by design, that you start

737
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
with a privacy mindset.

738
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But when I look at what's going on in America,

739
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I see that, for example,

740
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
a phone number, God forbid,

741
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
you give it to any company,

742
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
because you're just robocalling

743
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in the dark,

744
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
while in Europe,

745
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I mean, GDPR, and then you have

746
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
European Electronic Communications Code,

747
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
IECC, which conducts this robocalling,

748
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and I think,

749
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
well, maybe I wouldn't be in this dystopian world

750
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
if I lived in America.

751
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So, yes, it's a trade-off,

752
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
but, for example,

753
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't know about GDPR,

754
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
but there was an article

755
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
that said, for example,

756
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
that a long time ago,

757
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Target,

758
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
this pharmaceutical company,

759
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
was so happy

760
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
that they were expecting

761
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
something like

762
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
prenatal vitamins,

763
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
where they said that

764
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
their daughter was buying

765
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
things that indicated

766
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
that she was probably pregnant.

767
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I've never heard anything like that.

768
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Is it still a problem

769
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
that when you say something,

770
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
you get a response like that?

771
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Well, I don't know,

772
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
they could have said

773
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
that all certain things

774
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
in Europe

775
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
are too complicated,

776
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and then, actually,

777
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
they could have said

778
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that it's an IT thing,

779
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and that it makes no sense

780
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to re-engineer it.

781
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't know,

782
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
the Cookie Directive,

783
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I mean, what have we achieved

784
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
with it?

785
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
In a way, it works

786
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
like job security.

787
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
All those who sold something,

788
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
now got it back.

789
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We need this feature,

790
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
so everyone can sell it back.

791
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's a fucking annoyance.

792
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yes, and also,

793
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
with the Cookie Directive,

794
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't know how much

795
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
they've spent on it,

796
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
but it's a different story.

797
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
For the Cookie Directive,

798
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't know,

799
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't see the point anymore.

800
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The best thing is when it's

801
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
optimized for the phone,

802
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and then you try to watch it.

803
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But, for example,

804
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
one thing,

805
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
we mentioned scraping,

806
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
which is a different view

807
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
for public data.

808
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You have the Open Data Directive,

809
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
which, according to the law,

810
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
means that information is public,

811
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
because public entities

812
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
store certain data,

813
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
in machine readable formats.

814
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The logic is that

815
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
what the state has collected

816
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
from some useful information,

817
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
which may have commercial purposes,

818
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
everyone can access it.

819
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Then there's regulation,

820
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
which means that it's possible

821
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that someone will get

822
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
all the data from a bus driver,

823
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and someone will develop a solution

824
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
to optimize it.

825
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So, I don't know.

826
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
In the US, there's also

827
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
something terrible with public data.

828
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
We're not that far behind

829
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
in terms of digitalization.

830
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And, for example,

831
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
what you mentioned,

832
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the passporting of financial data

833
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
works much better in Europe

834
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
than in the US.

835
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
All those providers,

836
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
crypto exchanges, payment providers,

837
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
have to go state-by-state

838
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and get licensed

839
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
before you can get married.

840
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
In fact, the barrier to entry

841
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
in the US for some services,

842
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
which are regulated

843
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
at the state level, is very, very low.

844
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And it's better here in Europe.

845
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So, I think

846
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
we've probably reached some breakthrough.

847
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You can go to the whole market

848
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
very quickly.

849
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
In some areas, we're a bit

850
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
too predictable.

851
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Maybe we should

852
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
limit it to the end,

853
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
because Terminator will come out differently.

854
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Will it be that fast or not?

855
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's the question.

856
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I think it's hallucinating even more.

857
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
In my opinion,

858
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
if you get to know

859
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
how things work in the US,

860
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I often think

861
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
that everything is very liberal.

862
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The Big Eagle flies around

863
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and says,

864
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
they didn't hire me.

865
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Why not?

866
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm the only one in that state.

867
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
They didn't pay for that state

868
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
out of all those papers

869
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
to hire only me.

870
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
If you're from Nevada,

871
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
you'll work in California,

872
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and then in Nevada,

873
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
there are only

874
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Las Vegas developers.

875
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's it.

876
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't work there.

877
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't drink alcohol

878
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
in the US.

879
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Most people tell us

880
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
to buy whiskey from Germany.

881
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I've been to

882
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
the Cannabis Business Conference

883
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
in Slovenia,

884
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
where I met

885
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
people from Canada and the US.

886
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Marijuana is fully legal there,

887
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
but not on a federal level.

888
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Their biggest challenge

889
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is to switch

890
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
from one US state to another.

891
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Especially if the US

892
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
doesn't agree.

893
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's a federal shipping

894
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and on a federal level

895
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it's still legal.

896
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Their interaction

897
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
between the US and the US

898
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
is very confusing.

899
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The EU still has its problems,

900
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
but it has to follow

901
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
its own rules.

902
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You can't have

903
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
a local police

904
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and an interstate police

905
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
on a different level,

906
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
while they can arrest you

907
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
or arrest you

908
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
in a different way.

909
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
For us, Europeans,

910
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
it's very confusing.

911
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm interested in

912
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
if you can go from Croatia

913
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
to Portugal without

914
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
checking your passport

915
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and roaming.

916
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Data roaming is a great thing.

917
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'd say we know

918
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
what happened in the past.

919
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I think many young people

920
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
are convinced

921
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
that everything is worth it.

922
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
There was nothing

923
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
better than everything.

924
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
If you go to England,

925
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
they'll tell you

926
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that one megabyte is 10 euros.

927
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Please,

928
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
just open the data

929
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and you'll see

930
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
that it's 300 euros.

931
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What has the EU

932
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
done for us?

933
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Nothing.

934
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Maybe that's it.

935
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
There are too few

936
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
of these things.

937
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We've decided

938
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
on one thing

939
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
with the EU,

940
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and we've made it

941
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
a common denominator

942
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
that everything is better.

943
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Not that everything is bad,

944
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
but when I started

945
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
with IT,

946
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
it looked like

947
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
we really can't

948
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
make any progress in Europe.

949
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's easier to open a company

950
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
in Delaware in America

951
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and start something there.

952
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Sometimes,

953
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I think everything is

954
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
a general world.

955
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Maybe we shouldn't

956
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
be afraid of the EU regulations.

957
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I think many of these things

958
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
are media-driven.

959
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You open a website

960
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
or a magazine

961
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and they show you

962
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
a list of regulations

963
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and you're like,

964
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
wow,

965
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
what is this?

966
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
If you're a layman,

967
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
you think

968
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
there's a lot of this,

969
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
but I think

970
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
a lot of companies

971
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
fall out of this,

972
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
including IT.

973
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
In some episodes,

974
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
a lot of companies

975
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
are very regulated,

976
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
but very few are not.

977
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
We have a bunch

978
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
of irrelevant things

979
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
that I could probably

980
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
cut out,

981
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
but there are also a lot of things

982
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
that don't fall under.

983
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
They are placed in the media,

984
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
various

985
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
subcontracting agencies,

986
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
legal agencies,

987
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and maybe

988
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you just need to go

989
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
to the world to explain

990
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
what you need and what you don't.

991
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Don't be afraid of this, be afraid of that.

992
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Sometimes you will be afraid

993
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
if you don't know

994
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
what's going on.

995
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I mean, sometimes

996
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
it turns out that

997
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
for certain things

998
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
it's better

999
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
to pay a fine

1000
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
when you weren't

1001
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
prepared enough,

1002
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
or too little,

1003
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
or you didn't give

1004
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
everything you had,

1005
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
or you said

1006
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
that it's not as easy

1007
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
as it sounds.

1008
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I would say

1009
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
that it's not that hard

1010
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
to regulate.

1011
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
If we look at IT,

1012
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
a start-up,

1013
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
four colleagues

1014
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
working on a company,

1015
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
they are all changed.

1016
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
What you put on paper,

1017
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
you will have to deal with

1018
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
for a long time,

1019
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and it can be more difficult

1020
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
than with regulation.

1021
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
In my experience,

1022
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
it's more difficult

1023
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
with regulation

1024
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
than with everything else.

1025
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Especially if you have a lot of money,

1026
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
because sometimes you say

1027
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
that you gave this,

1028
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
but you didn't give that.

1029
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I compare a start-up

1030
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
to a band.

1031
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
When a band is formed,

1032
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it's very fast.

1033
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Who wrote the lyrics,

1034
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
who did the arrangement,

1035
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
who did the music.

1036
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
With a start-up,

1037
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
it's the same logic.

1038
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You can change it

1039
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
on Friday,

1040
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
on Saturday,

1041
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
on Sunday,

1042
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
on Monday,

1043
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
when you are a friend,

1044
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
when you are not a friend.

1045
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That's good wisdom.

1046
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's the best.

1047
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
When you mentioned

1048
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
regulation,

1049
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
it's one of two things.

1050
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
One interesting thing

1051
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
that will probably

1052
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
affect everyone,

1053
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
at least someone who is

1054
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
self-employed,

1055
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
because they sell

1056
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
their equipment

1057
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
in a critical

1058
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
infrastructure.

1059
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's why

1060
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
they can be

1061
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
regulated

1062
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
in accordance with that.

1063
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Everyone who is outsourced.

1064
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There are a lot of them.

1065
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
There is also Doro,

1066
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
which is an arrangement

1067
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
for the financial sector.

1068
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I've already heard

1069
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
that they started

1070
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
sending it to SP

1071
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and SP programmers.

1072
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Most of them are SP.

1073
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
They are outsourced

1074
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
and they have to...

1075
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
These are strict conditions,

1076
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
like the right of audit,

1077
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
so they can check everything.

1078
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
On one hand, it's logical,

1079
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
because if a bank

1080
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
has an outsourced SP,

1081
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
they don't have to

1082
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
check all the sensitive data.

1083
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
There are a lot of financial institutions,

1084
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
unfortunately.

1085
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
They provide a cloud

1086
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
with two-factor access.

1087
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes, absolutely.

1088
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But I don't know.

1089
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You are a security expert.

1090
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
No, no.

1091
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Once we were in a beer,

1092
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
there was a debate

1093
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
that those who

1094
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
operate as a company

1095
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
should come here

1096
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
as someone who is alone.

1097
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Because the cost

1098
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
for them is not too high.

1099
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And then again,

1100
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
the question is

1101
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
will only the big players

1102
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
survive?

1103
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Or will the small ones

1104
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
start working in some shops

1105
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
or in some firms?

1106
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I don't know,

1107
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
but the question is

1108
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
with the SPs,

1109
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
who will start thinking

1110
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
about joining the DOO?

1111
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Then you can go in that direction.

1112
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If you have a few colleagues

1113
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
in a shop,

1114
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
then you can start a firm

1115
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and sell your equipment that way.

1116
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I was thinking in that direction.

1117
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
With every regulation,

1118
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
what's the point?

1119
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
For example,

1120
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
for critical infrastructures,

1121
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I would...

1122
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
If we give an absurd example,

1123
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
if someone works

1124
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
as an outsourcer

1125
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
or a developer,

1126
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I would be happy

1127
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
to have a security protocol.

1128
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because I know so much

1129
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
about IT security developers

1130
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
that everyone thinks differently.

1131
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And to have a developer

1132
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
with security,

1133
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't know,

1134
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
it's impossible.

1135
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yes, it's true,

1136
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
but I would say

1137
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
that all these things

1138
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
are getting worse.

1139
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Also,

1140
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
20 years ago,

1141
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
when we were still

1142
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
working on Balkan-related things,

1143
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
someone said

1144
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
let's hire him

1145
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
to work on critical infrastructures.

1146
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think we gave it a chance.

1147
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's better,

1148
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
but still,

1149
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
it's likely

1150
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
that it won't happen.

1151
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I've already said

1152
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
that someone

1153
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
on their personal computer

1154
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
is probably storing data

1155
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
that would be classified

1156
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
for trust or something like that.

1157
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yes, or user access control.

1158
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
In some companies,

1159
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
everyone has access

1160
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
to everything,

1161
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and when someone new comes,

1162
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
he has everything on video.

1163
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It seems to me

1164
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
that when you work in IT,

1165
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
you look at these

1166
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
various controls

1167
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
on various security standards,

1168
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and then you download it,

1169
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
and you're like,

1170
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
these are really stupid controls

1171
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
that tell you the password

1172
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
must be greater than 12 digits.

1173
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Thank God that we have

1174
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
these regulations,

1175
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
because it's the minimum standard.

1176
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's impressive

1177
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
how many people,

1178
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
a year or two ago,

1179
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
we had some written debates

1180
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
where we were two-factor

1181
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
about what we already had.

1182
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It wasn't such an important system,

1183
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
but we were like,

1184
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
why are we still using two-factor systems?

1185
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I mean, you already log into every bank

1186
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
with two-factor systems.

1187
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
In my opinion,

1188
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Slovenia contributed a lot

1189
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
to the fact that security

1190
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and two-factor authentication

1191
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
were used.

1192
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I wouldn't say banks,

1193
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I would say scammers

1194
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and this kind of crime

1195
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
contributed to the fact

1196
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
that so many people

1197
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
suffered that it became

1198
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
such a serious problem

1199
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
that banks wanted

1200
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
to improve their users.

1201
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It could be an indie band.

1202
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Scammers.

1203
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I still think that

1204
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
we will never solve

1205
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
social engineering.

1206
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
When you hack

1207
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
a person

1208
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
and he gives you all the access

1209
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
because he thinks

1210
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
he can give you something bad,

1211
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
that's the worst thing.

1212
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's pure human psychology,

1213
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
how to

1214
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
actually...

1215
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You don't have to think

1216
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
how to hack.

1217
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's just about

1218
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
what kind of attitude

1219
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you will have towards the person,

1220
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
that you will gain someone's trust

1221
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
or in a smart way

1222
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
so that the feedback

1223
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
on the other side will be better.

1224
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So, in times

1225
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
like

1226
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
long, long time ago

1227
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
when those companies

1228
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
had those doors,

1229
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
like today,

1230
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
sometimes it was just

1231
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
because you had

1232
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
a bad day

1233
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and you wished

1234
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
a good day,

1235
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
you went over the fence.

1236
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Or just because

1237
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
you know exactly

1238
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
where you are going

1239
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and you don't need help,

1240
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
they told you

1241
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
it's a psychological trap.

1242
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And I don't know

1243
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
if we will ever solve it.

1244
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Because today

1245
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I think

1246
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
a lot of people have a problem

1247
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
because they don't know

1248
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
how to talk to AI.

1249
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
They already know that.

1250
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes, that's a big problem.

1251
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
How to talk to AI.

1252
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I don't know.

1253
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
There are a lot of people

1254
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
who don't have it.

1255
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because I already know

1256
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
that it's such a specific problem

1257
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
that they don't have it inside.

1258
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Just give me a chat.

1259
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I don't know.

1260
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I understand why it's happening

1261
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
because there are a lot of people

1262
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
but when I know that it's a specific problem

1263
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
there is no chance

1264
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
that the answer will be given.

1265
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
From our point of view

1266
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
is it better than getting

1267
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
an index on the other side?

1268
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Yes.

1269
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
We had a lot of experiences

1270
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
when we called someone

1271
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
and we were friends.

1272
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
More and more companies in Slovenia

1273
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
have AI chatbots.

1274
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I recently had a very interesting

1275
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
experience with emails.

1276
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I wanted to check where

1277
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
they sent me a package

1278
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that they didn't send me.

1279
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And just with the number of the package

1280
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
the email gave me all the data.

1281
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And I was like

1282
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
as much as possible

1283
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I could have my neighbor

1284
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
or someone else get it from the email.

1285
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I was talking to the bot

1286
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
on the other side of the phone

1287
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and I was like

1288
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
ok, interesting.

1289
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
He recognized everything I said.

1290
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So I was like

1291
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
ok, we definitely made

1292
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
a jump here.

1293
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But the security

1294
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
bothered me a bit.

1295
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The problem is

1296
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
with the package.

1297
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
When we were in the IT department

1298
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
someone sent me a chatbot

1299
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
on the GPT platform.

1300
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The problem was

1301
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
that developers said

1302
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that they have limited data

1303
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
that they can send.

1304
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
They can't just send it

1305
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
without someone getting

1306
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
the price of the product.

1307
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That was a real dilemma.

1308
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
If that chatbot

1309
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
gives you the price of a product

1310
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
you can buy it

1311
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
but the price will be different.

1312
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
That's problematic.

1313
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And if you have a company

1314
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and they give you a fake price

1315
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
you can't do anything.

1316
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I understand that developers

1317
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
can't just jump

1318
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
but they will go to the company

1319
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and you will tell them

1320
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
that this laptop costs 200 euros

1321
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and he offers it for 200 euros.

1322
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I want it for 200 euros.

1323
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So, yeah.

1324
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh, so they sent you a contract.

1325
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You can always say that.

1326
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

1327
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I think it's okay to say that.

1328
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
There have been cases

1329
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
where the market inspector

1330
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
told them off.

1331
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
A couple of companies

1332
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
already had problems

1333
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
with the pricing

1334
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
so they bought it

1335
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
but the market inspector

1336
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
didn't do anything.

1337
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It's an interesting balance.

1338
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I think there are also

1339
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
certain problems

1340
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
with very small

1341
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
releases.

1342
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
For example,

1343
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
this car model

1344
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
costs 12,000 euros

1345
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and they have 3 cars like that

1346
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and the rest are for additional equipment.

1347
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's a lot of money

1348
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
in a way.

1349
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Our market inspector does not fuck around.

1350
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I mean, he knows how to be more active

1351
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and also to sell more.

1352
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I think that

1353
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
there have been enough

1354
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
cases where

1355
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
it was necessary to

1356
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
make a decision.

1357
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah, and that's probably

1358
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
the difference between the USA and Europe.

1359
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
For example, in Slovenia

1360
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
not only because of

1361
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
the time limits

1362
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
but also because of

1363
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
private enforcement.

1364
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
For example, in Slovenia

1365
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
we rely on law enforcement

1366
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
because in that way

1367
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I can sue them.

1368
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But for me it would be difficult

1369
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
because I don't know how much time

1370
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I would need for that.

1371
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Unless I'm a lawyer

1372
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I would worry a lot.

1373
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And maybe

1374
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
in the USA

1375
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
the regulatory bodies

1376
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
are doing something.

1377
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
At the moment, no.

1378
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's more like

1379
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm going to sue.

1380
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
There is also a difference

1381
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
because in the USA there are

1382
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
financial damages

1383
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
that are not in Europe.

1384
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
It's not only the value

1385
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
but also the damages.

1386
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
If you have a loss

1387
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
or a loss of income

1388
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
in the USA

1389
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
there are also punitive damages.

1390
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Millions and millions.

1391
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
In Slovenia, even less.

1392
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The first association was

1393
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
the competition clauses

1394
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
that have defined

1395
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
contributions.

1396
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The competition clause

1397
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
with a big contribution

1398
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
that in Europe

1399
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
doesn't drink water.

1400
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yes.

1401
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The competition clause

1402
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and the punishment

1403
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
if you break it.

1404
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You all know

1405
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
there is always more.

1406
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
At the end of the day,

1407
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
it's a punishment

1408
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
if someone

1409
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
washes the windows.

1410
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The competition clause

1411
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
it's hard to get a lot of knowledge.

1412
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
No.

1413
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
The developer is

1414
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
doing something

1415
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
that doesn't have

1416
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
a lot of knowledge.

1417
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You said before

1418
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
that you could

1419
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
go to court

1420
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
because you know

1421
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
that the overhead is not that big.

1422
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I don't know

1423
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
because I do other things.

1424
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But then I thought

1425
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
that the programmers

1426
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
ask us

1427
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
what is the fear

1428
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
that you will go to court.

1429
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
What about you?

1430
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I mean, I can write

1431
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
that I will go to court.

1432
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
How do you look at it?

1433
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I write

1434
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but I don't say that I don't.

1435
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Although there is a lot of language in Slovenian

1436
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
which is very

1437
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
American, native, rich

1438
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and I don't know

1439
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
of course, but OK.

1440
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
For the court

1441
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I am also

1442
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,520
I've heard that there are already some cases on the court that seem to have been written down.

1443
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
I think they will be closed soon.

1444
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,000
Because, for example, in a case you have to structure the requirements of the part,

1445
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
when the plaintiff does not pay so much and so much.

1446
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Aha, there was a prompt.

1447
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yes, there was a prompt.

1448
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And there is a very rigid rule of how it can be composed.

1449
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Or, well, this one has to pay, that one is even simpler.

1450
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
But when you have a case for a more complex case,

1451
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
there we are also in the office, double-checking, triple-checking with colleagues,

1452
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and he drinks water for you.

1453
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Because it is a very formal logic and for that AI for now, no fucking way.

1454
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But yes, I don't know.

1455
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm just worried there, because, you know,

1456
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
everyone can be a little connected to it, but how to fuck them up, right?

1457
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So I will always need AI for the diagnosis of my medical condition.

1458
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Sure.

1459
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Okay, we will apologize for this problem.

1460
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Well, actually, I also heard from a medical colleague

1461
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that with a very well-described prompt,

1462
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
or what he understood from the patient,

1463
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
he got a very good answer,

1464
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
in which direction to think ahead, or what could be.

1465
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
That's right.

1466
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So maybe in that direction, some analysis,

1467
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
or in that direction that, I don't know,

1468
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
you will assign a stream of medical records, or a case,

1469
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and he will, you know, pull out a digest and say,

1470
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
this is where this came from, or be aware of that.

1471
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I don't know. Think about it.

1472
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yes, I think it is very similar to developers.

1473
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
If you know the whole topic, then somehow the field, the area,

1474
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
on which you then send 4GPT or whatever AI model to work,

1475
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
it is a great combination.

1476
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
If you are a pure layman, and you put something in it,

1477
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and the result goes a little in one direction,

1478
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
you don't know, you don't know how to logically combine it,

1479
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
or check the result.

1480
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
By itself, this is very weak.

1481
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So maybe this entry level,

1482
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
for an entry level person,

1483
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
this is a bit of a weak barrier,

1484
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
plus competition.

1485
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It seems to me that,

1486
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
maybe we are in a situation where, I don't know,

1487
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
if I didn't teach my child right now,

1488
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
the question is,

1489
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
would I teach them software development?

1490
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yes, maybe a little more, I don't know.

1491
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
In my opinion, the main problem,

1492
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
for us juniors, for us preparers,

1493
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
this will be the biggest problem.

1494
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Because when I work,

1495
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
if there was a spiritual task at the time,

1496
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
where there was this x-structure,

1497
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
then there is this x-structure,

1498
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and if it is quite simple,

1499
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
you just can't deal with it,

1500
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
because it does some other things,

1501
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
then you give it to a junior,

1502
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and then you sit down for 2 days,

1503
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
it goes in the right direction,

1504
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
it doesn't go in the right direction,

1505
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
it's like that for 3 minutes,

1506
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
and then it just writes like that.

1507
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I think that this entry level position

1508
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
will be in the software,

1509
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
and there will be even more of this gap.

1510
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I said the same thing,

1511
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
how can you be a senior developer,

1512
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
if you are not a junior?

1513
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
For us writers,

1514
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
when I started 10 years ago,

1515
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
as a preparer,

1516
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
most of the changes we made,

1517
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
and this is normal,

1518
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
because for a lot of changes,

1519
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
if you write anything in front of a notary,

1520
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
then you have to register in Slovenian,

1521
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
most of the examples,

1522
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I don't know, a group of Germans,

1523
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and they don't speak English,

1524
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
and then you have to translate.

1525
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Google Translate already existed,

1526
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and it was relatively good,

1527
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
and if you compare it now,

1528
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
it was really good.

1529
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But we are still very satisfied,

1530
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
we are very, very satisfied,

1531
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
yesterday at 9 o'clock,

1532
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
we published it,

1533
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
tomorrow at 12 o'clock,

1534
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
we sign it,

1535
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
100 pages,

1536
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I don't know how many people

1537
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
translated it,

1538
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
in all the writers,

1539
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
in Slovenia,

1540
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
they did it like that.

1541
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Now it's less people,

1542
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
AI, Google Translate,

1543
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
you still have to check it,

1544
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and yes,

1545
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
it's more fun,

1546
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
and I see that

1547
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
more people are using

1548
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
AI tools,

1549
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
so it can be more fun stuff.

1550
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
But yes, absolutely,

1551
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
to know what to ask,

1552
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
is very important.

1553
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I also use some GPT models

1554
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
for legal research,

1555
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
but I know exactly what to ask,

1556
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and I know exactly,

1557
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
because sometimes,

1558
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I don't know,

1559
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I don't know what to say.

1560
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But I think

1561
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
it's possible to

1562
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
draw a prompt,

1563
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
to put clear enough

1564
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
names, what to answer,

1565
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I mean,

1566
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
to train yourself.

1567
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I already tried

1568
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
to give the whole text of the law,

1569
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
because I couldn't find the link,

1570
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I don't know why,

1571
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I gave the text of the law in Word,

1572
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
uploaded it,

1573
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
and I saw the text of the law,

1574
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and I thought,

1575
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
if it's not in this text,

1576
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
then it's not in the law.

1577
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I mean,

1578
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I used it a lot

1579
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
for Visual Basic programs,

1580
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
to write it in Word,

1581
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
it's great for these things,

1582
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
but it's a low-level

1583
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
programming,

1584
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
you can't find it online,

1585
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
but instead of looking for it,

1586
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I write it down and it works.

1587
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
For these things,

1588
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
as I know, you said,

1589
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
for these simple things, it's great,

1590
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
but if it's more, you need to know

1591
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and understand all these things.

1592
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
That's it.

1593
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
When you looked at

1594
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Open Source licensing

1595
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
for these

1596
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
large language models,

1597
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
what does it mean?

1598
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Is it really

1599
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Open Source,

1600
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
where you can see

1601
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
how the model was learned,

1602
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
or

1603
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
are things a bit

1604
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
distorted?

1605
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I didn't look into it.

1606
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You did.

1607
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I would like

1608
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
to say

1609
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
that you lived here.

1610
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's very common for me,

1611
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
in public debates,

1612
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
open source

1613
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
solutions,

1614
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
or Open Source software,

1615
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
in the beginning,

1616
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
no matter how you

1617
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
translate it,

1618
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
it means that

1619
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
the code is public,

1620
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
everyone can check it,

1621
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and most of the licenses

1622
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
come with a lot of freedom.

1623
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You can take it,

1624
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
distribute it, modify it,

1625
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
if you deserve

1626
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
your annual income

1627
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
to exceed 1 million euros,

1628
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
you can ask us explicitly

1629
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
for a license.

1630
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But that's not the case

1631
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
in Open Source software,

1632
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
or the licenses that

1633
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
these organizations recognize as open source.

1634
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
We have the classic MIT,

1635
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
that's huge.

1636
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
When you look

1637
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
and talk about

1638
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
open source models,

1639
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
there are some models

1640
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
that you have to pull down,

1641
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
that are some kind of a burden,

1642
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
maybe an explanation

1643
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
of how the circus learned it.

1644
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But there are some skills

1645
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
inside.

1646
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It's very interesting

1647
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
to look at the scraps,

1648
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
licenses,

1649
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and all those solutions.

1650
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And then there's the hint,

1651
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
if you're an average Joe in Slovenia,

1652
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
or a physical person,

1653
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
it's not a problem.

1654
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But there are those

1655
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
that you can use,

1656
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
but if you're a direct competitor,

1657
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
then no.

1658
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
How are we going to do it?

1659
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
You can't distill it.

1660
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You can't take

1661
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
the information from that model

1662
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and re-license it

1663
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
with something else.

1664
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I think it's harder

1665
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
to clean open.

1666
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's very good marketing,

1667
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
but then there's the problem

1668
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
that people think

1669
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
that if you take it all together,

1670
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
you can't take it all

1671
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
with you.

1672
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's like taking

1673
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
a different terminology.

1674
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Basically, it's like this.

1675
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
If Lama or Meta

1676
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
have a license,

1677
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
they have the right to

1678
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
release it as it is.

1679
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But it's hard to call it open,

1680
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
even though I know that

1681
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
certain open source licenses

1682
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
have some limitations.

1683
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You have a lot of things

1684
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
when you do technical due diligence,

1685
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
to see if it's open source

1686
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
so that you can see

1687
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
what it's really worth

1688
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and what value it gives you.

1689
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You have to prepare it all night

1690
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and decide if you can

1691
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
take it out or not.

1692
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm not sure about that,

1693
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
but it's interesting.

1694
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Marketing.

1695
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
How did you look at those licenses?

1696
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Is it interesting to you?

1697
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
We, the programmers,

1698
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
click on them.

1699
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Like EULA.

1700
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You scroll down

1701
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and press accept.

1702
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I've already written about EULA.

1703
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It's a company

1704
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
where we also put

1705
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
half of the distilling inside.

1706
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
It's interesting to me

1707
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
how enforceable it is.

1708
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You also have

1709
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
intellectual property.

1710
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You have copyrights,

1711
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
copyrights, patents,

1712
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and database rights,

1713
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
which a lot of people don't know.

1714
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
If you scrape those

1715
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
on the internet,

1716
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
if you don't break the copyright,

1717
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
you'll break their database rights.

1718
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
If you put a database together,

1719
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
it's like

1720
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
in Bollywood,

1721
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
SQL base or whatever,

1722
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
it's a database right,

1723
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
and you can't...

1724
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
It has a value,

1725
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
a phone number.

1726
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I would say,

1727
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I took only one part out of it.

1728
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Did you break it,

1729
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
or do you say

1730
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
that when you put it all together,

1731
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
you break it because

1732
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
someone made a catalog?

1733
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Most of the time,

1734
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
we talk about the whole thing,

1735
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
but there's also

1736
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
public data,

1737
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
phone numbers,

1738
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
but you structured it,

1739
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
and that's why it has a value.

1740
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
For example,

1741
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
you have a website

1742
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
with a list of

1743
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
car accidents.

1744
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We'll talk about that later.

1745
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
If I made a decision

1746
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
to break the database,

1747
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
and then do something else,

1748
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
you want to say

1749
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
that it's not OK.

1750
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's not OK,

1751
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
plus there's another difference

1752
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
when it comes to the interactivity

1753
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
of the database,

1754
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and that's Terms of Use

1755
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
on the website.

1756
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
If you make a website

1757
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
for Terms of Use,

1758
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
it's convenient,

1759
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and it probably says

1760
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
that you can't break it.

1761
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
But for distillation,

1762
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I was thinking about

1763
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
how technical the problem is.

1764
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
The first time I heard

1765
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
about this concept,

1766
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I was like,

1767
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
you can't make a better model

1768
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
on the basis of that.

1769
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
But technically,

1770
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
it was done with DeepSea.

1771
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I think it's more about

1772
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
price-performance.

1773
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
You don't need all of that,

1774
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and maybe it's a bit weak,

1775
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
but in the end,

1776
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
it doesn't cost half a billion dollars

1777
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
to learn it,

1778
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and it's not that shady,

1779
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
but it's still a good price

1780
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
when you invest in it.

1781
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
That's how I understood it.

1782
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
No, no, no,

1783
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I just agreed that

1784
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
you can't do that,

1785
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and I was like,

1786
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I don't know how,

1787
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
but it's a part of it.

1788
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
That's an additional question

1789
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
about how many lawyers

1790
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
you have,

1791
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
and where you can

1792
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
look at something

1793
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
to see if it's technically

1794
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
correct or similar,

1795
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
or if you're not

1796
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
on the same page,

1797
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
and that's it.

1798
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Yes.

1799
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You always need to know

1800
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
the actual situation.

1801
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
No one can explain it to you,

1802
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
you just have to look at it.

1803
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
If you just look at the situation

1804
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
and say, yes, it looks great,

1805
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
the actual situation is something else.

1806
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So, the cooperation

1807
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
with the technical staff

1808
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
is always necessary.

1809
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You can't just

1810
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
go to your office

1811
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and write it down and say,

1812
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
that's it.

1813
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
This is the beginning

1814
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
of the isopressure.

1815
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Everything is on paper.

1816
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Yes.

1817
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
How practical

1818
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
is the question,

1819
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
because I've been

1820
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
to companies

1821
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
where everything

1822
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
went well

1823
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
with the contract,

1824
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
but it didn't reflect the actual situation.

1825
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Or did it reflect

1826
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
the actual situation of the moment

1827
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
when the contract was shown,

1828
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and they said, yes,

1829
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
let's fix it and move on.

1830
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The auditing period

1831
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
starts the next Monday,

1832
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and then you come back

1833
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
and you have to wait

1834
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
and then you come back.

1835
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
But, yes, it's according to the standard.

1836
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
But, also according to the standard,

1837
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
our sponsors are on paper.

1838
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Ah, yes.

1839
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So, we're on paper now.

1840
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So, now Andras

1841
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
is pleasantly hinting

1842
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
that we should thank

1843
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
our sponsors,

1844
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Human Frog, V-Nect, Kaldi,

1845
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
and Kufr for the space

1846
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
they give us for the recordings.

1847
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And, of course, Patreon,

1848
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
who have already created

1849
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
this episode.

1850
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Reptenica.

1851
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
If we try in Grodje,

1852
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
we can do it in Reptenica.

1853
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
No, in Grodje, they only support themselves.

1854
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Ah, yes.

1855
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Makes sense.

1856
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It's complicated.

1857
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
People are like, how many times

1858
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
have you had this in Grodje?

1859
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And I'm like, no, it's a framework,

1860
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
it's logical.

1861
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I interrupted you on purpose.

1862
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Amata is watching,

1863
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
because she doesn't know the question.

1864
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
We were like, she's not interested,

1865
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
he is.

1866
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
No, I think it's a good point.

1867
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I don't know, what worries me the most

1868
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
are the people

1869
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
of the legal part of their job.

1870
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's always...

1871
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
For me, it's like...

1872
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I'm always like...

1873
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I'm always like...

1874
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I work for a client,

1875
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
and I work for a client.

1876
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And it's a job,

1877
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
when you work for 15 years,

1878
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and you have a lot of risks,

1879
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and you have a lot of agreements,

1880
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
and I have some patterns of those agreements,

1881
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
that I worked with the legal team,

1882
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and I took other agreements,

1883
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
and I was like, why does it say

1884
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
that there must be access to the toilet?

1885
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And I was like, maybe I won't give it.

1886
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Or, for example, in a war,

1887
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
maybe I won't call it,

1888
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I won't give it either.

1889
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And those things,

1890
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
then you try to make some patterns,

1891
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
but everything you said,

1892
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I have good manuals,

1893
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
so we never argue,

1894
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and those agreements are never challenged.

1895
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But what worries me the most

1896
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
is always like, hey,

1897
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
now we have this hobby project,

1898
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
and it's some kind of Buddhist app.

1899
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
What is the minimum standard

1900
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
if I make an application

1901
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and someone else uses it

1902
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
with my colleagues and my family?

1903
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And that's something

1904
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
that I'm like,

1905
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
do I have to have a password?

1906
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Do I have to have GDPR?

1907
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Do I have to collect data?

1908
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That's one thing

1909
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
that I'm like,

1910
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
okay, what is the minimum standard?

1911
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And I hope that I'm like,

1912
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
or I copied it,

1913
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
because I'm a programmer.

1914
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Or plain text.

1915
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I think that's the top one

1916
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
from the shooting range

1917
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
for me.

1918
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
You're probably going to take

1919
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
an American one,

1920
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and you're going to ride that wave

1921
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
as long as you don't get caught.

1922
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Yeah, I do a lot of things

1923
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
for the Americans,

1924
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
but a lot of my colleagues

1925
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
are more German engineers,

1926
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
so they're like,

1927
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
what do I have to do?

1928
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
What is the worst thing

1929
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
that can happen to you

1930
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
in this job?

1931
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And then you say, okay,

1932
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
that's a thousand euros of damage.

1933
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It's hard to imagine

1934
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
all the possible examples.

1935
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Not a thousand euros of damage,

1936
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
but a life.

1937
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
A life that's in danger.

1938
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Okay, let's not go there.

1939
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I'm just doing a side job.

1940
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I started automatics and robotics.

1941
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Terms of use is fine,

1942
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
but you need to know

1943
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
that you're not being scraped

1944
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
or robbed.

1945
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Do I need to write

1946
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
who's behind it?

1947
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Am I an SP or DOO?

1948
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Do I need to write

1949
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
that I'm a DOO?

1950
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It's probably written in...

1951
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I don't know if it's translated

1952
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
or not.

1953
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I don't think you can see

1954
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
a DOO for an SP.

1955
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I don't know if the registrar

1956
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
writes you who's behind it.

1957
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
No, but if

1958
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
you need to

1959
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
go to an organ

1960
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
or a court,

1961
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
they can ask the registrar.

1962
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You can hear it until

1963
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
you destroy the door.

1964
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
It depends on what

1965
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
you're doing.

1966
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
As you said,

1967
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
you're making personal data.

1968
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Do you share personal data?

1969
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
What can you safely

1970
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
store? Do you have a printer?

1971
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
No, I don't have a printer.

1972
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That's the context.

1973
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's not a mail problem.

1974
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's a mail problem.

1975
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I don't know

1976
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
what the website does.

1977
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I don't know, let's say

1978
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
the website allows you to track

1979
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
all the batches of kombucha you're making

1980
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
at home. Or let's say

1981
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
you're making beer at home.

1982
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
You can go to the fermenter

1983
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and get a mail when you're done.

1984
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
No, that's already...

1985
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
That's already a whole stack.

1986
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
That's already a lot of data.

1987
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So, you're just

1988
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
making beer and that's it.

1989
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
No, because

1990
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
at the conference

1991
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I had with

1992
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
an information assistant, she said

1993
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
personal data is

1994
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
very different from the context.

1995
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But you can identify the employer.

1996
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
For example,

1997
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
a few years ago,

1998
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
IP,

1999
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
when they were more dynamic,

2000
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
more popular,

2001
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
but also dynamic,

2002
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
you could identify

2003
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
who had that IP at that moment.

2004
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So, yes,

2005
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
data privacy,

2006
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
yes, that's a whole list.

2007
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
About registration,

2008
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
there must be some...

2009
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Privacy policy.

2010
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
By the way, I really agree.

2011
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Our information service, Slovenian,

2012
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
is one of the most friendly

2013
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
regulators in Slovenia.

2014
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
It also has a lot of resources

2015
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
on the website.

2016
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Guidelines.

2017
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Guidelines are also very friendly

2018
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
for questions.

2019
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Because it varies from regulator to regulator.

2020
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
For my work,

2021
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
the best regulators

2022
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
are the ones that are like

2023
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
OK, let's find out

2024
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
if we did a bad job

2025
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
with the law, we'll be punished.

2026
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And most of them, thank God, are like that.

2027
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Also, maybe...

2028
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
A good idea for a project,

2029
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
to write a wizard.

2030
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That's the best.

2031
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You just don't know the template.

2032
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Something that is very different from the context

2033
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
to program a wizard.

2034
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Typical IT.

2035
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I like that a lot.

2036
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Maybe because it's so different from the context,

2037
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
it's good to have

2038
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
a constant process.

2039
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Whatever you add to the website,

2040
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
oh, we need to change the Terms of Use,

2041
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
we need to change the Privacy Policy,

2042
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
we need to screw up something else.

2043
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
You have to periodically

2044
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
save something

2045
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
and

2046
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
that the legal compliance

2047
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
part is done.

2048
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That's where you sold your job security.

2049
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
We don't need someone

2050
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
who will constantly work on that.

2051
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
The worst thing that Europe

2052
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
hasn't done is to make a draft

2053
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
of something for them.

2054
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I mean,

2055
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
if I sit in a vlog

2056
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
of a private person and say

2057
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I'm not a lawyer anymore, I'm fucked.

2058
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Now, if I have to say...

2059
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
If I have to give advice,

2060
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I'll do it minimally

2061
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
so that there won't be...

2062
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I tried, but...

2063
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You have to build it.

2064
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I understand.

2065
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So that no one finds you.

2066
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
There are also people

2067
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
who look for problems

2068
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
and will say,

2069
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
there isn't any,

2070
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
now I'll look for it.

2071
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It's not like in Slovenia

2072
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
when the neighbor will call you,

2073
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
or the competitor will call you.

2074
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I don't know how many competitors

2075
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
there are on the market for Apple

2076
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
compared to Kombucha,

2077
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
but you never know.

2078
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Maybe, I don't know,

2079
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
maybe you just need to measure

2080
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
and that's it.

2081
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Then there's

2082
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
the other extreme.

2083
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Let's say

2084
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
that this app

2085
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
works for you,

2086
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
and you're there,

2087
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
now you have

2088
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
an incoming student

2089
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
who hacks this app.

2090
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Does that mean he has black hoodies

2091
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
and...

2092
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
He hacks it,

2093
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
and everyone gets emails.

2094
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
He's so friendly

2095
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
that he can say,

2096
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Andraž, I saw this,

2097
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
you're so reliable.

2098
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
What are you going to do about it?

2099
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I think that's

2100
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
pretty late.

2101
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
The information system

2102
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
because you always have

2103
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
these white hat hackers

2104
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
to good people.

2105
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
The problem is how to deal with it.

2106
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I know that

2107
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
there are a lot of hackers.

2108
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
When I was younger,

2109
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
they were

2110
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
just a healthy expression

2111
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
for the use of cracker.

2112
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
It was like a difference

2113
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
if you're a hacker or a cracker.

2114
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Then, because of the pirate games,

2115
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
they just used cracker

2116
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and there was a bit too much racial slur

2117
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
for white people.

2118
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
There was also the script kiddies.

2119
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Those who just copy

2120
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
what they see on the internet

2121
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
and then they copy it.

2122
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
They don't know how it works

2123
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
and then they do all the magic.

2124
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It's a good thing

2125
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
because all IT people,

2126
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
developers, security experts,

2127
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
they want a proof of concept.

2128
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Not just that you found

2129
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
a vulnerability,

2130
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
you want to get inside.

2131
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
That's not OK.

2132
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
If they call you and say,

2133
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I think that's it,

2134
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
it would be great

2135
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
if they would just call you

2136
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
and say, sorry, there's a bug.

2137
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It's really hard

2138
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
because until you try it,

2139
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
you're not sure if it's a bug or not.

2140
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
But technically,

2141
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
it can affect

2142
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
good in the IT network.

2143
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
That's why it's good.

2144
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
If someone is more professional

2145
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
in pen testing,

2146
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:14,400
You either have to agree to it, or you look for companies that have publicly announced bug bounty programs or agree to it.

2147
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,400
You are a bit more on the safe side.

2148
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:35,200
No, it's not like that. Larry Farrie, for example, always puts himself in the role of personal relations, if it's a state-owned company or public enterprise, because he doesn't know how to protect our health and information security.

2149
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:44,400
You know, if someone pays you too little for help, and then you tell him about it, they will go medieval on your ass.

2150
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,400
It's a bit of a managed relationship.

2151
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:57,200
Maybe that's one scenario, that you are the villain.

2152
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:03,200
But I would say that there are a lot of people who believe in good things.

2153
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:09,199
They want to demonstrate, to say that they have the ability to do so.

2154
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:20,000
On the other hand, I can take it as a defense, and say that I did it.

2155
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I just showed it, I didn't do anything wrong, I didn't steal anything from him.

2156
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:36,000
But on the other hand, in the logs you can see that there is some evidence that he was there.

2157
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:46,800
I would say that you should try to communicate with different bodies, such as C-Cert, etc.

2158
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:58,800
But they don't make a full disclosure with the website, or with your personal website, like you do.

2159
01:16:59,599 --> 01:17:07,599
I found some reliable photos in the health homes, and then I asked for C-Cert as a mediator.

2160
01:17:07,599 --> 01:17:11,600
It wasn't just...

2161
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,600
Esquiline Jackson.

2162
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,600
Esquiline Jackson, I just said in the title, it's the same.

2163
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:25,600
And I saw that Esquiline Jackson, I didn't touch that table or anything, and I sent C-Cert.

2164
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:32,399
It was weird that the developer wrote in the logs that he developed it,

2165
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:38,399
and then I went to Google and found all the other health homes with the same reliability.

2166
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:40,399
And then it lasted for quite a few years.

2167
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:42,399
But what about the conclusion?

2168
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:44,399
They sent it, but it lasted for a long time.

2169
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:48,399
And I didn't disclose it until it was removed.

2170
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:53,199
It's not reasonable, but it's a responsible disclosure.

2171
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:59,199
That if you find a reliability, you don't disclose it to anyone before it can be removed.

2172
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:05,199
Technically, I did it with the intention of discovering that reliability,

2173
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:09,199
but I didn't have much data on it.

2174
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:13,199
I only knew that it was technically reliable, but I didn't write any data.

2175
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And you can see that if you give an anonymous statement,

2176
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
it means that it's not a scam and you don't make a specific mistake,

2177
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
because you know that it's reliable, but you don't know anything about the system.

2178
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yes, but it's interesting for a new student.

2179
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Yes, that's why you don't do it.

2180
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:36,000
No, I remember that in our FAQs, when we had the electronic index relatively fresh,

2181
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,800
I think it was obvious to us that there was a mistake.

2182
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,800
You logged in with your e-mail address and password,

2183
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,800
and it wasn't just a basic HTML page,

2184
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
where your e-mail address was inside,

2185
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
and you changed it.

2186
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Yes, and I could see everything from another student.

2187
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,800
I think they fixed it, but you can think,

2188
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
yes, that's also true.

2189
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:09,600
What is the responsibility of the one who did it?

2190
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:15,600
Not the one who did it, but the one who founded the Cambucha site,

2191
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,600
which could have done it in such an unreasonable way.

2192
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,600
That's what we talked about today.

2193
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,600
Don't we have some kind of law

2194
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,600
that you can't park your car anywhere,

2195
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:30,399
and if something happens to your car,

2196
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,399
it's your fault?

2197
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:34,399
It's not a law,

2198
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,399
but I think it's probably interpreted that way.

2199
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:40,399
I don't know if it's the most correct interpretation.

2200
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:42,399
You know,

2201
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:46,399
I said this in one of my FAQs,

2202
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:50,399
the fact that someone has a locked Wi-Fi,

2203
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:52,399
doesn't mean that you can get close to it.

2204
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:54,399
If there's a locked door,

2205
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:56,399
it doesn't mean that you can go inside and steal it.

2206
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,200
But it's a different FAQ.

2207
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:03,200
Yes, but I think that the Italians and Germans

2208
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
had...

2209
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,200
I mean,

2210
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,200
they were at the public places,

2211
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,200
right?

2212
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,200
The point was open,

2213
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,200
but now,

2214
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,200
such an offer is a crime

2215
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,200
for any nonsense that could happen.

2216
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,200
Yes, and that's why

2217
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,200
in Italy and Germany

2218
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,200
you always have a page

2219
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
with all the necessary information.

2220
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
On the other hand,

2221
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
you remember the podcast,

2222
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
don't you?

2223
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I don't remember which episode,

2224
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
but yes,

2225
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
it's very important

2226
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
to look through the prism

2227
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
of civil responsibility.

2228
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I mean,

2229
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
what kind of responsibility is there

2230
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and then look at the cause,

2231
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
the damage,

2232
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
and all that.

2233
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
If it's a very small damage,

2234
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
it's a big problem,

2235
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
then you have to

2236
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
look at it case-by-case

2237
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and simply check

2238
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
all the actions.

2239
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
It's completely dependent.

2240
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
A company could develop it

2241
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
and then release it.

2242
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Now, when I look at

2243
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
technical problems,

2244
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I don't know, SQL injection,

2245
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I'll say, I don't know what it is,

2246
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
it's a big damage, small damage,

2247
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
small damage,

2248
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
small damage,

2249
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and then look through it.

2250
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Then comes the damage

2251
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
responsibility.

2252
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Now, how the company will act

2253
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
from the inside,

2254
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
they may then look for the culprits,

2255
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
but again, it's a bit of a work law,

2256
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
a bit of a civil damage.

2257
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
It will be decided what kind of damage

2258
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
is there.

2259
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Yes, that would be

2260
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
prepared at the court.

2261
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It's just a rule of thumb.

2262
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
For example, SQL injection,

2263
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
it's a very old technique,

2264
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
but it's well-known.

2265
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I don't know how much more

2266
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
it's well-known.

2267
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It's still present

2268
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
in the top 10.

2269
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
You didn't read

2270
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
the input.

2271
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But maybe, for example,

2272
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
it would be right

2273
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
to mention

2274
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
the rule of thumb.

2275
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
The company, the developer,

2276
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
on the other hand,

2277
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
did it,

2278
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
and then it was transferred.

2279
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Then, of course,

2280
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
an IT security expert

2281
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
said, look, this is bad.

2282
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
No one would do that.

2283
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
No one would

2284
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
put out a fire

2285
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
with gasoline.

2286
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I don't know, I'm joking,

2287
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
but it would be a court action

2288
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
because there was responsibility

2289
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and it's very difficult.

2290
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I mean, it's the same with

2291
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
response errors.

2292
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
You always look at the standard,

2293
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
what is expected of the respondent,

2294
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and so on.

2295
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
If you are a respondent,

2296
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
which is a free call,

2297
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
do you have that responsibility?

2298
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Yes.

2299
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It's a very bizarre thing

2300
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that we have,

2301
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
because there are people

2302
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
from Great Britain

2303
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
in Slovenia,

2304
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
so you either

2305
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
don't have it,

2306
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
or you can

2307
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
take it

2308
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
from the intermediary

2309
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
just in case.

2310
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's really interesting.

2311
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Yes, for the respondent,

2312
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I mean, notaries don't do it,

2313
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
but the respondent has the right

2314
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
to make a call for insurance,

2315
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
and then...

2316
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I was looking for that

2317
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
and we were looking for that,

2318
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
and they called us for insurance,

2319
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and it was like,

2320
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
OK, what is that, why do you need it?

2321
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Like building a bridge.

2322
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's a very different development.

2323
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I mean,

2324
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
it depends on what you do,

2325
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
but I think

2326
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
it's still very difficult

2327
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
to express my responsibility.

2328
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I mean, OK, we had that,

2329
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
but as far as I understand,

2330
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
the programming process,

2331
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you know,

2332
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
a lot of times it's like,

2333
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
it doesn't work.

2334
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I mean, is there really

2335
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
someone who screwed up,

2336
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
or is it the hardware,

2337
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
or some other factors?

2338
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I think a lot of those,

2339
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I don't know,

2340
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
probably in other industries

2341
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
it's very similar.

2342
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I mean,

2343
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
a team,

2344
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
like a company with a reputation,

2345
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
but they also develop

2346
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
some juniors

2347
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
and students

2348
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
that they have there,

2349
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
because it's a sub-private sector

2350
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
that develops it,

2351
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
and those people

2352
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
don't know anything different.

2353
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
They don't have those kilometers,

2354
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and they come from certain mistakes.

2355
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And now someone has to answer for that.

2356
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
What was that example

2357
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
when this security company

2358
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
froze the whole Windows cube?

2359
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Crowdstrike.

2360
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
That was a complex mistake.

2361
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
The problem is,

2362
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
we don't have a judicial inquiry.

2363
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I'm an electrician.

2364
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Telecommunications.

2365
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I could screw an antenna,

2366
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
but I can't work with microwaves.

2367
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
So I'm programming some complicated hardware.

2368
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Technically, it's not my expertise.

2369
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
But Crowdstrike,

2370
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
especially in development,

2371
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
has an extra step,

2372
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and I think it will stay that way,

2373
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
even on a daily basis.

2374
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
It will start differently.

2375
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
QC, right?

2376
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You need to test it.

2377
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Yes.

2378
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
But you,

2379
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
you come to it through mistakes.

2380
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It also happened to me,

2381
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
as I mentioned yesterday,

2382
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
in the weather forecast,

2383
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
that you have a few bad weather forecasts,

2384
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and then you think,

2385
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
OK, I made a mistake here,

2386
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
if I don't fix it,

2387
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I'll be fined, etc.

2388
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Yes, I mean,

2389
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
the IT forecast I work with

2390
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
is also a matter of experience,

2391
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
knowledge, and process.

2392
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
My colleague worked with city forecasts,

2393
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
and the more you do them,

2394
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
the more city things you see,

2395
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
you know what's good to include,

2396
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and so on.

2397
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
With the IT forecast,

2398
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
it's good to know the source code,

2399
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
who it belongs to,

2400
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
what are the disadvantages,

2401
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
what are the advantages,

2402
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and so on.

2403
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Or the maintenance forecast,

2404
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
SLA, and so on.

2405
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You mentioned it earlier.

2406
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
The forecast I have

2407
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
in the Slovenian version

2408
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
says that the right

2409
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
for the code I produce

2410
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
is brought by the company,

2411
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
paid for by the account.

2412
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
That's what it says in the forecast.

2413
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
With larger corporations in Slovenia,

2414
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I always get the right one.

2415
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
When they say,

2416
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
no, that can't happen,

2417
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
we pay for it, and it's brought to us,

2418
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and so on.

2419
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
That's the kind of thing

2420
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I need.

2421
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That's the most typical change I get.

2422
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Yes, that's true.

2423
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
On the other hand,

2424
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
there are a lot of things

2425
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
that you simply

2426
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
don't think about,

2427
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
in the sense that

2428
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
you have a developer

2429
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
on the other side,

2430
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and you have the right code,

2431
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
and so on.

2432
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
What about the admin access,

2433
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and who has it?

2434
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
If you are connected to the developer,

2435
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
and you have admin access,

2436
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
and you can also host,

2437
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and if you don't pay for it,

2438
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
it can be very difficult.

2439
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Two or three years before

2440
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
your page is solved,

2441
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
and you don't have anything.

2442
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
It's good to think about

2443
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
these things in practice.

2444
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Our listeners

2445
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
like to hear war stories.

2446
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Do you have a name,

2447
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
an IT name,

2448
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
that would be interesting,

2449
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
or

2450
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
a Slovenian name,

2451
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
or something that

2452
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
receives the respect?

2453
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I didn't say this earlier,

2454
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
but there was a similar case,

2455
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
where our side,

2456
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I don't know if it was

2457
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Lisanjan Kulijan,

2458
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
said it very well,

2459
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
that it's good in all IT development

2460
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
situations,

2461
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
because of the client,

2462
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
and it's also good

2463
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
because we still get

2464
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
a lot of headaches,

2465
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
and now it's solved.

2466
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Yes, it's impossible,

2467
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
but how can you not feel it?

2468
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Because you signed it.

2469
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
It was for a development project

2470
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
with a page that cost

2471
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
over a million,

2472
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
and it was for an online shop.

2473
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I didn't know what a million and a half

2474
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
would cost, because there was

2475
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
nothing special.

2476
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I agree,

2477
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
but I think that the developers

2478
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
are very smart,

2479
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
our side is one of the top developers,

2480
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
and they are all smart,

2481
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
especially in terms of

2482
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
the economy,

2483
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
because it's going to be crypto-based,

2484
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
and on the blockchain,

2485
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
and they paid a lot for it,

2486
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
but then our side

2487
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
didn't want to pay at the end,

2488
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
because the page wasn't worth it,

2489
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
and then we started to stop

2490
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
everything,

2491
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
and they paid for it,

2492
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
but instead,

2493
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
they hosted the source code.

2494
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
All of this was done by the developers.

2495
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
They pulled the plug,

2496
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
our side couldn't

2497
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
generate income,

2498
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
because they didn't work on the website

2499
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
for sales, and then they tried

2500
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
to put it together

2501
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
with some old databases.

2502
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It was a horror story,

2503
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
when you want to help a page,

2504
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
but you're like,

2505
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
hey, how can you help me?

2506
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'll call him in two years,

2507
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
and he'll sign it,

2508
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
but he won't sign it.

2509
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
And then,

2510
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
let's sit down

2511
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and talk a little,

2512
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
if you find

2513
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
some mediation,

2514
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
and you come together.

2515
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Absolutely,

2516
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
mediation is a great thing,

2517
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
but the problem is that

2518
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
a lot of pages

2519
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
are full of ego,

2520
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
in the business,

2521
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and he won't even

2522
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
bring me a call.

2523
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And if Slovenia is small,

2524
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
2 million people,

2525
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
you'll probably be able

2526
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
to get along,

2527
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
maybe you'll find a colleague.

2528
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
What's your horror story?

2529
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
When you said that

2530
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
the biggest horror for me

2531
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
is when someone says,

2532
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
hey, we signed this,

2533
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
that's it.

2534
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
It also happened that

2535
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
we signed this,

2536
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
and I said,

2537
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
it's over,

2538
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
and he said, no,

2539
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
we'll move on.

2540
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And it also happened

2541
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
that on the other side,

2542
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
they said,

2543
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
ok, you want it a little different,

2544
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I added things in,

2545
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and we went to a more meaningful

2546
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
meeting.

2547
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I have a lot of horror stories,

2548
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
but you'll find out

2549
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
how it goes.

2550
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
If you work as a reporter,

2551
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
you have hundreds of pages,

2552
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
it's different than if you're

2553
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
an in-house reporter.

2554
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Yes, the pages are more

2555
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
scanty.

2556
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
You can't reduce anything,

2557
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
we worked hard on it.

2558
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
But yes, you don't know what it is.

2559
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
There's still brownie,

2560
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
but you don't know what it is.

2561
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I mean, yes,

2562
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
thank God,

2563
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I have a lot of luck,

2564
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I work for a big newspaper,

2565
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
you can have a fair page,

2566
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
and you can't pay for it.

2567
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And you can't change it,

2568
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
because we can,

2569
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
maybe we got it,

2570
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
but no,

2571
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
it's a piece of work,

2572
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
which is fine,

2573
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
but it's good to be honest,

2574
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
it's a joke,

2575
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm just saying.

2576
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Well,

2577
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
we already drank a lot,

2578
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
so now it's time

2579
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
for the second round.

2580
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
For the second round,

2581
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
we said it's after,

2582
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
because we'll record

2583
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
something else,

2584
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
just beer.

2585
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
So,

2586
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
what was your final thought?

2587
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Did you like it?

2588
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Yes, yes.

2589
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Now it's a topic.

2590
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Yes, after midnight.

2591
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
That's the setup.

2592
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
No, I liked it a lot,

2593
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
but it's nice to have

2594
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
a different perspective on things,

2595
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
because, you know,

2596
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
we have two lawyers,

2597
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
and as a guest,

2598
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
we also have lawyers.

2599
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Where can we find you?

2600
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
On every podcast platform.

2601
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I'm a bit of a CEO genius,

2602
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
so it's hard.

2603
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Maybe it's easiest to find me

2604
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
on one name.

2605
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Yes, because we have P2 Podcast,

2606
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
and we have 2.0.

2607
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
It will change once.

2608
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Yes, once.

2609
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
But I have Apple Podcast,

2610
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Spotify.

2611
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
On YouTube,

2612
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
if you type P2,

2613
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it will find you.

2614
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
What did I miss on YouTube?

2615
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Google Podcast, Kino,

2616
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I don't know.

2617
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And LinkedIn, Facebook?

2618
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Yes.

2619
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And which pubs?

2620
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Whichever.

2621
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Is there a chance

2622
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
that you are more present

2623
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
than recently?

2624
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Not recently.

2625
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Recently, I've been writing

2626
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
under Messenger,

2627
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
but in Ljubljana,

2628
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
one of the best pubs

2629
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
is Sir William's.

2630
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
It's an institution.

2631
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Plus 10.

2632
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Tectonics, too.

2633
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I like Tectonics,

2634
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
because it experiments.

2635
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Leibach.

2636
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
More than that, yes.

2637
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
But you drink too much alcohol

2638
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
every year.

2639
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
That's it.

2640
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
You can still find us

2641
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
on classic channels.

2642
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Like and subscribe.

2643
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000

to their pub.
