1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're very sorry for the delay.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're very sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We always accept criticism

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to forget to introduce our guests

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in the garden.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We don't have any guests.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't have any guests.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can try to make an intro.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And today,

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to introduce

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
our guests.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I'm going to introduce

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
our guests.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I'm going to introduce

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
our guests.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And today, in a new episode in Grodno,

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in the fourth season,

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I think we've seen each other

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in the fourth season.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Rockets and fish.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm a rocket, he's a fish.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And today, in Grodno, you're called

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Andraž Sraka,

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Loki,

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Andraž Brodol,

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Brodnik Brodol.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What about me?

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And the host Otto Bergles.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Is that okay?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're not

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in the same boat.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're in the same boat.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're a flat structure.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're a flat structure.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Otto is the boss.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I feel naively responsible

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for taking so long.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We're all the same.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dr. Nipi and Otto Kril.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now you're alone in the garden.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We have to figure out

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
what to do.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We've invested so much time and energy

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that now I feel naively

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that we have to push it forward.

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, push me.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The title of this episode

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
is Rockets and Fish.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I hope that during this episode

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we'll discover a different,

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
better terminology

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and we'll get a title out of it.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's the title of the documentary.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As I said,

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
this is the first episode

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
of the fourth season in Grodno.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who would have thought

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that we'd make it this far?

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The agenda for today is

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to bring together

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the topics

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that are close to us

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and that we'll talk about.

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We'll see

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
how far we'll get.

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You've already

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
interrupted me.

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who would have thought

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that we'd make it to the fourth season?

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I mean, who?

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you had said

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that we'd record

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
this speech

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and three years later

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we'd be here.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's good.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, Nikol,

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
my thinking was...

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You know,

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm not sure

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
what it'll be like for me.

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's always a direction

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
we want to go.

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are we close to that direction?

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How many years has it been?

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Three?

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's the fourth season.

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We have so many major releases

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
on the app.

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's the name, right?

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know.

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Last time I had an update

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
on the Grodno.ca page

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and I went there

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to change the header text

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
to Grodno.

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think this mission

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
is kind of balancing

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
what we want to be

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and what we want to become.

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think it's becoming clearer

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
what's yes and what's no.

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We're slowly preparing

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
what we want to be.

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Last year,

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I thought we had to come up

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
with a new strategy

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
for Grodno.

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now that we've seen

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that there's a new law,

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I feel like

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we won't be able

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to position ourselves

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
as a media.

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Everything is primary.

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
PICASI says

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that Grodno is a technological community

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
of people

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
who want to connect

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and create

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
those personalities.

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We want to be a community

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
of seniors,

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
of the younger generation,

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and we want to

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
talk about the things

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that are important to us.

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think we're united.

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can correct me if I'm wrong.

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's all about the question

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and the discourse.

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Are we

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
managing

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
this mission?

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If we look at it

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
like this,

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
last year,

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
if I'm not mistaken,

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
last year

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we made

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
17 episodes,

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
16 plus one,

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
something like that.

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's a lot.

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
During the year

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
not all of them were 90 minutes long.

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Some of them were

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
even shorter.

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We made

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
17 episodes,

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
some of them were special

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
only for Patreon.

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Those were some kind of

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
content production.

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We also went to

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
various conferences

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and meetups.

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We also hung out with people

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
or supported conferences

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and events.

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We retweeted

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and posted on LinkedIn

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
when something happened.

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We tried to

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
bring people

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to these events.

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We tried to bring

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the online community

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and the offline community closer.

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think we managed to do that.

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
During the last event

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
at the end of the year

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
some people

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
who organized the conference

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
came to us and promised

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to do something interesting this year.

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
we positioned ourselves well.

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why is that good?

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the market

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that we have

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
with these people is relatively small.

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I think it's good that we are close

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to the people for whom

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
these events are organized.

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
interrupt you.

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I would like to ask

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
the same question.

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How does it look like

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
last season?

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How do you see

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
where we started and where we are now?

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We supported

198
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
a student group

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and moderated

200
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
a round table.

201
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think that

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
when I talk to people

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
my peers

204
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
who are senior people

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I think that

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
it's good

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to listen to them.

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have a lot of time

209
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to listen to them,

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
but I don't like the idea.

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think it's good

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to have an icon

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
or a northern star

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in the group.

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Even if they don't follow you.

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Even if they are not

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
regular listeners,

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
they can consume it.

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We have

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
ultra-fans who are super happy.

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We have people who are really happy

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to cover a specific topic.

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
For example,

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I work more in the field of ESRI,

226
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DevOps, systems.

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They are like, oh my god,

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we are really happy

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
when it comes to these topics.

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think that for someone

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
who likes this industry

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
it's really valuable.

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I also watch it

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
quite often.

235
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know how meaningful

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
it is for us to be in this live stream,

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but it will be really fun

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to watch it in 10 years.

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm really happy.

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I know it's cringy,

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but it's such a cool production.

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We can honestly talk about

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
some things.

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's purely anthropological.

245
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What we do,

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
what we are doing,

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think it's really good.

248
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's quite unique.

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not filtered.

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know.

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A few times

252
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
we were reminded

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that we are at the beginning

254
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and we have a slow start,

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but we are engineers.

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
When I come in the morning,

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have a coffee,

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I open a pool request to review,

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but I'm an engineer.

260
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If I were a DJ

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
or a professional,

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I would deal with public performances.

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I would be full of energy

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and all-American.

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why aren't you?

266
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I am what I am.

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think that

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
authenticity is

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
the most valuable thing.

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I realized that

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
if we talk

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to people

273
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
who do these things,

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
who have done these things,

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
who live for these things,

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it's easier to connect

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and organically add some personality.

278
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you have someone

279
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
who talks about topics

280
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
that are not close to us,

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you lack the journalist's

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
point of view,

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the journalist's experience.

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't want to say it in a bad way,

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but I think it's not interesting.

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I mean,

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't want to try

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
to get out of the water

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
because you fail.

290
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Maybe we can practice

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and do something

292
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to be more conversational.

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you want to do interviews

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
one-on-one,

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
then you can practice.

296
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Andraž, what do you think

297
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
about last season in Grozny?

298
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What energy?

299
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's a question

300
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
that really makes me sad.

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's been half a day in five

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
since the last interviews.

303
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Half a day in five.

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No, to be honest,

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think that...

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I honestly didn't think

307
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that I would drive him to sleep.

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Shock.

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Shock.

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Partly because

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
we let go of

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the inner tension.

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I would keep that

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
somewhere.

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
On the A channel?

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, sometime during the recording.

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
People come to us, right?

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes, they do.

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, joke.

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We actually

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
got to the point

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
that the fourth season,

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
as Otto said,

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we did a lot of things

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that you

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
probably didn't

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
even imagine

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
at the time.

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It was like,

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
why would I

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
have my own Discord,

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
why would I have

333
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
that interaction with people?

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It made sense.

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why would I

336
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
want to be on YouTube?

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It makes sense,

338
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
whether you want it or not.

339
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I think that

340
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
we talked about it

341
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
at the beginning,

342
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
when we were recording here,

343
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that the last season

344
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
was very on the road.

345
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A lot of things,

346
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
because he was jumping around

347
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
in Grodno,

348
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
so...

349
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I made a mistake

350
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
about that.

351
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Couch?

352
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes, couch.

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We made some

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
organizational changes

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
for the fourth season,

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
so that we have

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
two-week

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
retros and planning.

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We're not a startup anymore.

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Now we need a corporate,

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and some meetings.

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We talked about

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
what works

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and what doesn't.

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
One thing that we

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
noticed is that

367
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we went to a lot of events,

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and we were present.

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's a logistical

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and demanding task.

371
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You have to transport people,

372
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
then you're in a group,

373
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and so on.

374
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's stressful

375
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to record events,

376
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
if you're in that environment.

377
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think it's very important

378
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
to emphasize that

379
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
it's not our job.

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's not something

381
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that we do for free.

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's our free time.

383
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's our hobby.

384
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I wanted to say

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that we did a lot of events,

386
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and the episodes

387
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that were recorded

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
on the conference

389
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
will have a different dynamic

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
than if they were recorded

391
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
in a couch.

392
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Maybe this year

393
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
we'll have a bigger couch,

394
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and less conferences.

395
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But it's a good thing

396
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that we did

397
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
a mini-series of Bites

398
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
between the last episodes.

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We did the shorter episodes,

400
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think it's like

401
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
half an hour long,

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
three episodes.

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's very interesting,

404
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
because it's something

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that we did easily at the conference.

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can bring your friend

407
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and talk about

408
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
one topic at a time.

409
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The feedback was also

410
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
very interesting,

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
people liked the format.

412
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I won't say

413
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
that we won't do anything

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
at the conference this year,

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
but maybe in a different format

416
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
we'll find a balance

417
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
of pleasure.

418
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
As you said,

419
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
we're both startups.

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
A very important thing

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
that we can't forget

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
is that we do it

423
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
freely,

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we finance ourselves

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
with Patreon,

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
with our supporters,

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and the cash goes to production,

428
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
equipment and expenses.

429
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We need to realize

430
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
that we're people

431
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
who want to do it,

432
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
who take time for it,

433
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
who don't work with others

434
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
because of that.

435
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When you try to lead

436
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
such a synergy,

437
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you have to respect it.

438
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We also come to the question

439
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
why don't you have girls,

440
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
why don't you have Asana,

441
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
why don't you have a ticketing manager?

442
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
When I get another girl

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
for this job,

444
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I see that it's more

445
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
organized.

446
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We're all Slavs.

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Programmers.

448
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
To some extent,

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
it's nice to connect a hobby

450
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and a job,

451
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
so it's a bit like

452
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
my ex-manager.

453
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But I don't know

454
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
if you'd look for a ticketing system

455
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
for the city of Grodno.

456
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I mean, it's there now.

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't know,

458
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think there are

459
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
about 90 people

460
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in Grodno now.

461
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And that

462
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
simplicity means

463
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
that we have a new service,

464
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
a new website, a new project.

465
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It means that people

466
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
can invest their time

467
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
in this project.

468
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And maybe it doesn't work

469
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
like we have a big team

470
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and users.

471
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If people rotate,

472
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
we got new

473
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
support.

474
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I hope that

475
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oliver, who will help

476
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
in PR,

477
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
that we'll get

478
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
new audiences,

479
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that we'll be able to

480
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
improve

481
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
all the topics

482
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
by individuals

483
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and organizations that prepare us

484
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and support us to improve communication.

485
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I hope that

486
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
we'll get

487
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
what we're trying to do.

488
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's it.

489
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What else did we learn

490
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
from last season?

491
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Maybe that

492
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
it's very important

493
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to work for ourselves

494
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and that it's cool for us

495
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
to work with people who are close to us.

496
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Because then we can work

497
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
for others.

498
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Anything else?

499
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If I don't have more...

500
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, I'm just happy that

501
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't have to watch Mišalka anymore.

502
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And that this technique

503
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
is only for January 15th.

504
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a law.

505
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm very happy that someone else

506
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
started writing LinkedIn posts.

507
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I can't tell you how much

508
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
it means to me.

509
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And that it's well written.

510
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That it's better written.

511
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I hope we'll improve it.

512
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't be sad anymore.

513
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's move on.

514
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's move on to the future.

515
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You didn't tell us

516
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
where are the 10 topics

517
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that we talked about today.

518
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The idea is that we'll

519
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
talk about rockets and fish.

520
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I wrote here

521
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
ccc.de

522
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's Chaos Communication Congress.

523
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's a conference

524
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that takes place every year

525
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
in Frankfurt.

526
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No, it's Hamburg.

527
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No, no, no.

528
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It was in Hamburg and then

529
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
moved to Berlin.

530
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Then it was in Hamburg again.

531
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There were some events in Leipzig.

532
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But mainly in Hamburg.

533
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm a big fan of this conference.

534
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oto, why haven't you been there yet?

535
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I have a problem.

536
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Wait, wait, wait.

537
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
First of all, I'm afraid.

538
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I hear that it's the best

539
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and you don't have to

540
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
be a researcher or a hacker.

541
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If you haven't been there,

542
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
you'll lose all credibility.

543
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you haven't been there,

544
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've already confirmed that.

545
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But this conference is

546
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
for Christmas and New Year holidays.

547
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What do I mean?

548
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
25th, 26th, 27th...

549
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
From 27th to 30th.

550
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's December.

551
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

552
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's a small date.

553
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's the biggest problem.

554
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you have three kids

555
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and you tell your wife

556
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
sorry, babe,

557
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
for the New Year holidays.

558
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's a bit risky.

559
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Everyone will be older.

560
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I know you have to prepare

561
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
for everyone to have it.

562
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But tell us about the date.

563
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's very interesting.

564
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So, yes.

565
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It was on the 38th

566
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
when

567
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
this event took place.

568
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What is it about?

569
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's easiest to describe

570
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
a well-known DEF CON.

571
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes.

572
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I would say

573
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
it's a European DEF CON.

574
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Besides that,

575
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
security hacking is...

576
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I won't say it's not,

577
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
but it's so bad.

578
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hacking is

579
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
art,

580
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
biohacking,

581
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
everything you can

582
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
include here.

583
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
In the broadest sense.

584
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
In the broadest sense

585
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
possible.

586
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
People

587
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
who deal

588
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
with technology

589
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in a different way,

590
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
for technology,

591
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
let's say

592
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
from physical

593
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
hardware hacking

594
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to food hacking,

595
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
to the level

596
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
of metaphysical,

597
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
philosophical,

598
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
legal,

599
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
civil society,

600
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
where we go,

601
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
are the laws in the right places.

602
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The idea

603
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
of this congress is

604
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
four days

605
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
of

606
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
lectures

607
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
by

608
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
employees

609
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
who are prepared,

610
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
go through a meeting

611
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and then return.

612
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think this year

613
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
there were about

614
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
190 lectures.

615
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I think you gather

616
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
between seven halls

617
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and

618
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
a group

619
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
of

620
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
self-organized assemblies

621
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
where the employees

622
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
or some groups

623
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
go and

624
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
meet.

625
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So,

626
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know,

627
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I think there were

628
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
14,000 people

629
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
at the meeting.

630
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The maximum capacity

631
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
of the Hamburg

632
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
congress center

633
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
is

634
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
something like

635
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
four days.

636
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This year

637
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I was

638
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
pleasantly surprised

639
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
that there were

640
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
a lot of Slovenes

641
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
after a long time.

642
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I think there were

643
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
35 Slovenes

644
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
when I counted

645
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
or when I managed

646
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
to gather

647
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
a lot of students

648
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and a lot of people

649
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
who were first.

650
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It is commendable

651
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
that this conference

652
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
or congress is in this spirit.

653
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We are doing it

654
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
on a fairly free level

655
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and what is being financed

656
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
is to cover the expenses

657
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
of the event,

658
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
the venue,

659
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know,

660
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the 50 giga optics

661
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
in the congress center and so on.

662
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Is it hard to get a ticket?

663
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I mean, it is hard.

664
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let's say

665
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that this year

666
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
it was relatively easy,

667
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
but last year

668
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
there were a lot of people

669
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
so it is easier

670
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
to get a ticket

671
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
if you join a group

672
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
or if you meet people

673
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
who are there

674
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
to get a ticket.

675
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If you work in an open source project

676
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
you know that there will be

677
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
a group of people there.

678
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Tickets are valid

679
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and you can join

680
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and you know that you will be there.

681
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It is easier to get a ticket

682
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
if you know that you will help

683
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and that you are a part

684
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
of their angel system.

685
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
This year I saw that

686
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
a few Slovenes

687
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
also helped.

688
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
For example,

689
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
security hacking

690
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
means modifying

691
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
technologies

692
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
in their own name.

693
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You can say modifying

694
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
but you can also say

695
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
searching.

696
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This is important

697
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
because if you say

698
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
hacking to someone

699
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
they don't think what we think.

700
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Full hacking means

701
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that people

702
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
don't think what we think.

703
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Give us an example.

704
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
What was interesting for you?

705
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Last year

706
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I didn't go

707
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
to lectures that much.

708
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Wait.

709
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You go up for 4 days

710
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and you don't go to lectures?

711
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You know that

712
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
things happen at lectures.

713
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Ok.

714
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You know, you hang out

715
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
with people

716
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and most of those lectures

717
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I would say 99%

718
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
are quality

719
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
recorded

720
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
with transcripts

721
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and simultaneously

722
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
translated.

723
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Of course, it's great to see it live, but those things that happen when you hang out with these people after the show,

724
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
you ask them, you join them, they have some kind of event that hasn't been recorded yet.

725
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Those things have some added value, why it made sense to be there.

726
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Or if you are part of an open source community, when something is being done there, to be a part of it in the end.

727
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Now, this show, I don't know, what was interesting, I don't know how well-known it was two years ago,

728
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
this big affair in Poland with these trains.

729
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes, you make a recap.

730
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes, the Poles bought some trains.

731
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
No, there is a vendor.

732
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
In Poland, right?

733
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
In Poland, there are more vendors that deliver trains.

734
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Do they deliver or service?

735
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
No, they deliver.

736
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
No, no, they deliver.

737
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And then there is this thing where you have to take the trains for repair or, I don't know,

738
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
summer service, as far as the cars are concerned, they are not summer anymore, I don't know,

739
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
but it takes a lot of time.

740
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And what started to happen is that these trains,

741
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you make a recap, we want this train, and then you buy the train as a manufacturer,

742
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but in the beginning you want it to be serviced independently of the manufacturer.

743
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So you can go to any vendor and then you tell the manufacturer,

744
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
we want to have it written down how to service this train, and it has to be as usual.

745
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But if you buy a car, it is not prescribed that you have to go to the repair service,

746
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
really, no guarantees.

747
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This was a gift that these services are still in operation,

748
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
because this is an operational service, they have a certificate that they know how to service these trains.

749
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, let's make it simpler, let's imagine it for a car.

750
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And this gives the developers inside Geofencing or other mechanisms

751
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that an independent servicer or another servicer,

752
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
these are not independent, like someone who screws cars,

753
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
but like a big factory that repairs trains, or maybe repairs trains itself,

754
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
couldn't fix them because of these screws.

755
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Actually, in the firmware, the train vendor made a lock-in,

756
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
which is in connection with the fact that others won't know how to fix it,

757
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
like we do, which means that these specific services

758
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
were then asked by the developer for help,

759
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and this was calculated successfully by the developer,

760
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and yes, on a certain schedule,

761
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
because, of course, the vendor also applied for a schedule for maintenance,

762
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
this vendor failed, and when these trains needed repair,

763
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
it turned out that a lot of things went to waste,

764
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and those who prepared the schedule, or the municipality, or whatever it was,

765
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
had such a problem that they were literally eaten by hackers.

766
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So they were actually eaten, and it wasn't even the fans themselves.

767
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
No, no, no, they were eaten, and it's a funny thing,

768
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
how they were eaten, as if Google would say,

769
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
hey, let's get rid of a lot of hackers in Poland,

770
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and then someone fell out, let's go,

771
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and the fans were so far away,

772
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
okay, we'll solve this,

773
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and they were very professional in solving these problems,

774
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and reverse engineering, and they found a bunch of vendor lock-ins,

775
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I don't know how it's done, I don't know,

776
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
like you said, Andraž, geo-fencing,

777
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
that when you're at a certain point, the train stops,

778
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
or when it stops for a long time, you can't start it again,

779
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and similar problems,

780
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and these problems, they presented it two years ago,

781
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
made a disclosure that it's happening,

782
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
but in January or December, it was a different story,

783
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
when the thing has actually surpassed the state level,

784
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
that it's now being solved at the courts,

785
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
where the court line is now,

786
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
that the vendor is now a hacker,

787
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and that it was a modification of the firmware,

788
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and you have these funny photos,

789
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
like snapshots of a certain code,

790
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
which is actually their own code,

791
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
or inside, and you know,

792
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
that's what the hackers wrote,

793
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and it's actually from the original firmware.

794
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And they say it's because the manufacturer is trying to say,

795
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that for all their trains,

796
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it's a free upgrade.

797
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Now they want to cover up these problems.

798
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
To destroy the train.

799
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's right.

800
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And now it's a problem,

801
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
which is developing in Poland,

802
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and a lot of these members,

803
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
these hackers,

804
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
these penetration developers,

805
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
who came to these conclusions,

806
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
are actually getting civil lawsuits.

807
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
A documentary was made,

808
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that was one of the things,

809
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
which was among the most discussed,

810
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and it's also interesting.

811
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's made, it's online.

812
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Only one question,

813
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I have one question,

814
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
while we're talking.

815
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're a security researcher,

816
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
how did they come to these codes,

817
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
to be able to investigate them?

818
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Can you tell us?

819
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Do you have that insight?

820
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because what I'm saying,

821
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
how did they come to these codes?

822
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
They dumped the hardware,

823
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
the firmware,

824
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and then the firmware made a debugger,

825
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and they tried to reverse engineer it,

826
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
to see how it works,

827
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and they successfully combined it,

828
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
to make sure that there's no geofencing,

829
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
that there are coordinates,

830
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
that there are parameters,

831
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
and that's it.

832
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You know what I'm interested in?

833
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I don't want to hijack the whole thing,

834
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but among all the millions of people,

835
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
who are invested in this infrastructure,

836
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and programming,

837
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is it hard to get to these dumps?

838
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No, these are PLCs.

839
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You need a physical one,

840
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I understand that we're all freaks here,

841
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
but we're also electrotechnicians.

842
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You have the hardware,

843
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
it's a bit more complex,

844
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
but it has PLCs.

845
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Programmer logic computer.

846
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Or controller.

847
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
In PLCs there are ROMs,

848
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
ROMs are security PLCs,

849
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and ROMs have standards,

850
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and that's very well defined.

851
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You have C++ extensions,

852
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but that's not why the hardware

853
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
has so many standard things.

854
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The controller is a security PLC,

855
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
so it doesn't press anything,

856
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
or locks on trains.

857
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Those are additional standards.

858
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
In the end, it's a computer.

859
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
If you take B as a PLC,

860
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
it's an ARM or slow Windows,

861
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
where the system runs on isolated cores.

862
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's a software.

863
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You dump the images,

864
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and you can put them in ADO or WD Compiling.

865
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You can't program everything,

866
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
so it's easier to reverse engineer.

867
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Because you have standard things,

868
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
that are not on the PLC.

869
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because the ports are clearly defined.

870
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No, you don't compile a binary and put it up.

871
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You write it in a language,

872
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
like Ladder or Structure Text.

873
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Those are the two languages.

874
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You write something.

875
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It has C++ extensions,

876
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
but you can't audit it inside the company.

877
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You have to understand,

878
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
that the trains are not programmed

879
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
by someone who made them for free.

880
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's done by machines,

881
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and it's more structured for the sake

882
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
that it's more maintainable.

883
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's not like, let's write a code,

884
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and the compressor will run on the train.

885
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You write a hex,

886
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and you decompile it.

887
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Then you look at it.

888
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The registers are on the physical relays.

889
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
When you change a bit in the virtual memory,

890
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
it can mean that on the PLC

891
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
you opened the physical relay.

892
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
These are more complex systems.

893
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm curious,

894
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
are they encrypted?

895
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No, it's not encrypted.

896
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's encrypted in the sense that...

897
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Do you have physical access?

898
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's not like there's a USB port,

899
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
where you can see where you have to stop

900
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
to get to the train.

901
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But it's not obfuscated.

902
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The safety, the traffic lights...

903
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You can imagine that in a traffic light,

904
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
you can't have two green lights on.

905
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Obviously.

906
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
In the PLC, it's solved.

907
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But in a safety,

908
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
when the safety controller sees

909
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
that something went wrong,

910
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
it will go into error state.

911
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
In a traffic light,

912
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
you can't increase the speed.

913
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
No, but it's just a premonition.

914
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I thought that this is

915
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
a software-defined train

916
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that goes here and there.

917
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
When you go left, you go right.

918
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I wanted you to give us a background

919
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
so that people have a feeling

920
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
of what we're talking about.

921
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You have a lot to do with wireless.

922
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Did you go more into wireless hacking?

923
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yes, I did.

924
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Is 5G a topic you're interested in?

925
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
No, I mean...

926
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
AI, was AI a topic?

927
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This year,

928
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I think that from the inside,

929
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
besides the fact that there are

930
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
different networks,

931
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
wireless networks,

932
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
where people get access to the Internet

933
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and the internet,

934
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
there is a project called GSM.

935
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
There is a phone network

936
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
where you can get an extension

937
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and you can log in or log out.

938
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This year, it was very retro

939
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and they installed the ISDN network.

940
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
They were the first ones

941
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
to install the ISDN technology.

942
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
BBS, Klicalce, etc.

943
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Very retro.

944
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yes, very retro.

945
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You can start something

946
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
with this technology.

947
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It was all very well documented.

948
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If you didn't participate at the time,

949
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
or you were a viewer,

950
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
now you can have the opportunity

951
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
to see a lot of these things.

952
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
There was a lot of talk

953
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
about open source projects.

954
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It was an interesting topic.

955
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't know.

956
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
One of the lectures

957
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
was about how to solve a satellite

958
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that has lost control

959
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and is circling in orbit.

960
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
A student at a faculty

961
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
said how he managed

962
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
to reprogram the firmware

963
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
so that it can no longer

964
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
flash the firmware.

965
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What was the communication

966
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
with the dead satellite?

967
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The satellite was not dead,

968
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
but it was returning certain data

969
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
to the server.

970
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It didn't return certain data

971
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
because part of the firmware was deleted.

972
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The entire firmware and all the registries

973
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
were on the same stack.

974
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Part of it was deleted

975
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and they had the feeling

976
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that they had lost control over it.

977
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But you could still access it.

978
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It was his doctoral thesis.

979
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
He took the time to reverse-engineer

980
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
certain things.

981
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It was one of the oldest satellites

982
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that a German university shot down.

983
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It was a soft shell,

984
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
like a cube in orbit.

985
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He successfully activated

986
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
the camera that the satellite had.

987
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The firmware did not support it

988
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and they never tried it.

989
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
They never worked with it.

990
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Part of it was written off

991
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
so that it was a deep picture.

992
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It was such a good find

993
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
How old was it?

994
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Was it a 10-year-old satellite?

995
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No, it was a school satellite.

996
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It was a 10-year-old or 8-year-old in orbit.

997
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
When you launch a rocket,

998
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
you have different dimensions of the satellite.

999
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Typically, they are cubic or circular.

1000
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Circular ones are stable,

1001
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
but a lot of them crash.

1002
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
They are school satellites.

1003
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
There are also other things on the CCC.

1004
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
People hack devices for communication,

1005
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
or biohacking,

1006
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
or cooking,

1007
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
or how to make apple cider.

1008
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I once talked to a person

1009
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
who did a doctorate on pear cider in France.

1010
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You have a lot of things.

1011
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
One more question.

1012
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We sold you.

1013
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
When you started talking,

1014
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you said that all the important things

1015
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
are recorded,

1016
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
but you also said that it is very important

1017
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
what happens on sidewalks.

1018
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Do you like whiskey?

1019
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I also taste whiskey.

1020
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
No, I like the whiskey on the balcony.

1021
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
All the whiskey is here.

1022
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Only the CCC has whiskey licks.

1023
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
When people bring their whiskey,

1024
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
you turn it around and lick it.

1025
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's a coincidence.

1026
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I wanted to ask you.

1027
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
We have a lot of listeners

1028
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
who don't go to conferences.

1029
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We were at a conference last year.

1030
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
How do you start talking

1031
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
to people who are teachers?

1032
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Like when we talked about satellite hacking.

1033
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
How do you set up communication?

1034
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
We have a lot of introverts

1035
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
who come to us.

1036
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It's great.

1037
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You go to the Slovenian Kubernetes Meet,

1038
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and you talk to me.

1039
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You go to Whiskey Licks,

1040
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
you drink something,

1041
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and then you start talking.

1042
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Give us something more specific.

1043
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What is the best icebreaker to talk to?

1044
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I listen to conversations in the garden,

1045
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and then you come to a person and say hi.

1046
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That's it.

1047
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Why do you ask that?

1048
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Not necessarily.

1049
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
People often ask me

1050
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
what I do for a living.

1051
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I don't know how I advance in this industry.

1052
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But if you want to...

1053
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You have to get out of your comfort zone.

1054
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You don't rush into the topic.

1055
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I think the beginning

1056
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
is a small event.

1057
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You have a small event at home.

1058
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You have to record everything,

1059
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
you have to stream,

1060
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
you have a Discord,

1061
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and everything is online.

1062
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You try a small event.

1063
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
At the beginning,

1064
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you are just a listener.

1065
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Then you start networking.

1066
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You join a group,

1067
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
maybe invite people,

1068
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
but also ask some questions.

1069
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You introduce yourself.

1070
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm new here, I don't know you.

1071
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't know much.

1072
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
When you are a senior,

1073
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
what do you do to get a better job?

1074
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
What do you have to do?

1075
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Definitely sell.

1076
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Is it hard to make your flow stop?

1077
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
No.

1078
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Maybe it won't be

1079
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
at the main hall,

1080
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but you will come to a smaller hall.

1081
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Even if your flow doesn't stop

1082
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
at the main part of the program,

1083
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
it's still a self-assembly event.

1084
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You have a hall,

1085
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
where you talk to people.

1086
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I will demonstrate that.

1087
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's like football.

1088
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You play football.

1089
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You start regional.

1090
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If you want to be in the Premier League,

1091
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Slovenian organizers

1092
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
always look for a teacher.

1093
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It's not like people contact you

1094
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and tell you how much they want you.

1095
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's the opposite.

1096
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You want to organize an event,

1097
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
you find a local teacher,

1098
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and then you look for another one.

1099
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You don't need to have a phone

1100
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
or a map,

1101
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
but you need to motivate people

1102
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
to come.

1103
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You start regional,

1104
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and then you connect.

1105
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
If you want to go to CCC as a visitor,

1106
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
there will always be 5 people

1107
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
in the Discord group.

1108
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You tell them how many times you've been there,

1109
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and they tell you that you've been there 10 times.

1110
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
We've been there 18 times.

1111
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
18 times?

1112
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
One question related to that.

1113
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Do you have to be an expert to do that?

1114
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
No.

1115
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I think a lot of people have that problem.

1116
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Do you have people who are self-confident?

1117
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
No.

1118
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Do you have to be a technologist

1119
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
to do that?

1120
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
No, because you have impostor syndrome

1121
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
and you have no idea.

1122
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You have meetups.

1123
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You have a 5-year organized meetup.

1124
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
If you have that standard

1125
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
that it has to be more and more,

1126
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
you'll be the only one at the meetup

1127
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
who knows,

1128
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
because they have meetups from beginner

1129
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
to intermediate to advanced.

1130
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I would say that at the beginning

1131
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
it's more important that you do that meetup.

1132
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
People are like,

1133
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
if I go to a meetup,

1134
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I don't go there because of the meetup.

1135
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
If I'm interested in implementation,

1136
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I go to the meetup to see what's going on

1137
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and I don't have to do a meetup

1138
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
because I'll have a written skin.

1139
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
When you're a senior,

1140
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
you're doing nothing,

1141
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
and if you do a meetup,

1142
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
it's very unlikely that you'll be able to do

1143
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
exactly what you want.

1144
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I think that general,

1145
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
beginner and intermediate meetups

1146
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
are the most important.

1147
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I don't look at the meetup

1148
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
because I've been watching it for 10 years.

1149
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
To put it simply,

1150
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
maybe CCC is not the place

1151
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
where you want to start.

1152
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Football?

1153
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's great that we have you.

1154
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Maybe at the beginning of the year

1155
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
or the beginning of the first season,

1156
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
if you need some ideas for this year,

1157
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
maybe try a talk until the end of the year

1158
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
at one of the local meetups.

1159
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Go to Sonya Odobja and try to submit something.

1160
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
If you don't know where to submit,

1161
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
DM me.

1162
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
DM Andraža directly, we'll exchange.

1163
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Is that why you're so busy?

1164
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
No, I'm the only one who cancels.

1165
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I cancel you.

1166
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Let's continue.

1167
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Let's go to another topic.

1168
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
One of the most random topics

1169
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
is that last year

1170
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Python overtook JavaScript

1171
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
on GitHub

1172
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
as the most popular language

1173
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
in the world.

1174
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's the most used language

1175
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
according to their metrics.

1176
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
What's your comment on that?

1177
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Are you crying, JavaScript?

1178
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Are you crying, Python?

1179
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Both of you are crying.

1180
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't know if the world has changed

1181
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
because this metric has changed.

1182
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You're both in organizations

1183
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
where Go is the main stack.

1184
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I have a feeling

1185
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
that since AI is still Python

1186
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I don't know why

1187
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
AI and Python are so different.

1188
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Landscape is like that.

1189
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Or are there other tools

1190
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
that Python is ahead of?

1191
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
As far as I'm concerned,

1192
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
you can learn everything.

1193
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
JavaScript, Python, Django.

1194
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
If you're a senior,

1195
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
you need to know everything.

1196
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
At the end of the day,

1197
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
it's all about coding.

1198
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I don't know.

1199
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,160
I think the hype is due to data science and AI,

1200
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,160
that Python has grown a bit,

1201
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,800
and I think there is a movement

1202
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
that people just want to do things,

1203
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,440
and if you want to make a fast SaaS,

1204
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,000
you need a system like Ruby on Rails or Django,

1205
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,639
or Elixir, just so you can run in 3 days

1206
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:23,639
a bunch of models and render something.

1207
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:25,639
Python can make a job done, that's it.

1208
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:28,400
That's what I've noticed.

1209
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,880
The question was why Python in AI,

1210
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,160
and engineering, data science, AI in the world,

1211
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
why is that?

1212
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,520
Users start giving these tools at random,

1213
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,520
and when you see that the implementation

1214
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,520
of those libraries is always using some C,

1215
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,520
C++, Rasta, something more exotic,

1216
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,560
and Python is said to be a very nice

1217
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:01,200
and ergonomic wrapper on top of that.

1218
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
They are building a wrapper,

1219
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,199
but they are trying to learn the language.

1220
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,199
Yes, it's good enough,

1221
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:09,199
it's good enough,

1222
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,199
there will always be problems,

1223
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:13,199
because it's a bit like

1224
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,199
a European type of engineering,

1225
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:17,199
diversity, right?

1226
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,199
Well, at the end of the day,

1227
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,199
you have to know everything.

1228
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:23,199
I know the scales.

1229
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:25,199
We left that for later,

1230
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,199
but it was a milestone for me,

1231
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:29,199
when I wrote it down.

1232
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,199
OK, we've covered that point quickly,

1233
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,199
so let's move on.

1234
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,199
One of the bigger topics that

1235
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:39,199
everyone is talking about,

1236
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,199
and that are relevant,

1237
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,199
is the job market.

1238
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,199
For all three of us,

1239
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:49,199
last year we replaced

1240
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:51,199
our core pages,

1241
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:53,199
and we were all in the process

1242
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:55,199
of looking for

1243
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,199
other customers, I would say.

1244
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,199
I'm just curious,

1245
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,199
what did you see

1246
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:03,199
in the job market

1247
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,199
in the summer of last year,

1248
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:07,199
and what do you see as trends for the future?

1249
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,199
I won't jump directly

1250
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,199
into that focus.

1251
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,199
Last year I noticed,

1252
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,199
and I see this year as well,

1253
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:19,199
that there is a big increase

1254
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,199
in what we call

1255
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,199
ghost jobs.

1256
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,199
Ghost job is a term

1257
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:27,199
that is now used

1258
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:29,199
to describe some phenomena,

1259
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,199
which I will describe,

1260
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,199
and then you can ask me

1261
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:35,199
about it.

1262
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,199
Organizations constantly

1263
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,199
announce that

1264
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,199
they have an open job

1265
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,199
available for all possible

1266
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,199
living positions.

1267
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,199
These jobs are

1268
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:49,199
freshly announced,

1269
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,199
and they are constantly

1270
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:53,199
being announced.

1271
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:55,199
When you sign up for

1272
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,199
this job ad,

1273
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:59,199
you either don't get

1274
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,199
any response,

1275
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,199
or you see that

1276
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:05,199
10,000 people have

1277
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:07,199
signed up for the job interview,

1278
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,199
or you see that a copy

1279
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,199
has been uploaded again,

1280
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:13,199
or it also happens

1281
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:15,199
that organizations

1282
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:17,199
have this job interview

1283
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,199
process now,

1284
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,199
I don't know exactly why,

1285
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,199
but they have 7-8 steps,

1286
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,199
which I think

1287
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,199
has almost doubled

1288
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,199
compared to some

1289
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:31,199
previous years,

1290
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,199
and today this process

1291
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:35,199
of job interviews has become

1292
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,199
completely different.

1293
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,199
Then I also notice

1294
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,199
that until

1295
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:43,199
the interviews

1296
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,199
are almost repeated,

1297
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:47,199
and then when you go through

1298
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,199
all these processes,

1299
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:51,199
you end up being left out.

1300
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:53,199
They don't give you offers,

1301
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,199
or whatever,

1302
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,199
or they say,

1303
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:59,199
thank you,

1304
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:01,199
now we have given you

1305
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,199
our base,

1306
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,199
and that's it.

1307
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:07,199
This is something

1308
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,199
I was very careful about,

1309
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,199
when they say,

1310
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,199
yes, you are very interesting,

1311
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,199
or we will give you an offer,

1312
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:17,200
and you focus on

1313
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,200
one person,

1314
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
and then you prepare yourself

1315
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,200
for the interview,

1316
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
you go through everything together,

1317
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
but in the end,

1318
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
you don't get the job.

1319
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
This is something

1320
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
I was careful about,

1321
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
and I don't have to comment

1322
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
on Slovenia,

1323
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
because they have already

1324
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
started doing this.

1325
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,200
So, yes,

1326
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
you have the term

1327
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
GoJobs,

1328
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
and you don't have

1329
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
these symptoms.

1330
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
I think that

1331
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
these things are still relevant,

1332
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
and I don't know,

1333
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,200
the quota on the stock market

1334
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,200
is somehow increasing,

1335
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
and they are still

1336
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
investing in the staff,

1337
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
and so on.

1338
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
The question is,

1339
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
are they really increasing

1340
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,200
the staff,

1341
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,200
or are these jobs,

1342
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,200
what I saw in Ljubljana,

1343
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
was it really

1344
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,200
a trend,

1345
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,200
where,

1346
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,200
as you said,

1347
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,200
you didn't get any

1348
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
feedback,

1349
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
or was it

1350
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,200
an automated way,

1351
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,200
where a bot

1352
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,200
went through your CV,

1353
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
and if it found

1354
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
enough keywords,

1355
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,200
then maybe you had

1356
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
someone who said,

1357
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,200
yes, I'm interested,

1358
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
but I was very surprised

1359
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
that it was so hard

1360
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
to get to the first initial screening.

1361
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
So, you get a person

1362
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
on a call, and you

1363
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
talk to someone,

1364
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
and there was a lot of

1365
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
replying,

1366
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
a lot of replying

1367
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,200
to positions

1368
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
where you didn't

1369
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
really have a say.

1370
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
But I understand,

1371
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
it looks like

1372
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
it's...

1373
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
It's a phenomenon

1374
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
that we have,

1375
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
that people are looking for

1376
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,200
security staff,

1377
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
and so on,

1378
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
but then you realize

1379
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
that you can't

1380
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
hire someone

1381
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
on a daily basis.

1382
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
And now,

1383
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
I would say that

1384
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
a lot of good people

1385
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
are on the market today.

1386
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
I don't know,

1387
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
in our field,

1388
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
it's a normal,

1389
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
average period,

1390
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
two to three years,

1391
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
when you work with a client,

1392
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,200
or you're employed

1393
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,200
So, a lot of people

1394
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
are still looking for

1395
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
new opportunities,

1396
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,200
and it's interesting

1397
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
how this

1398
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,200
doesn't happen today.

1399
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
I think,

1400
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
first of all,

1401
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
for Landscape,

1402
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
I had a lot of trouble

1403
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
deciding between

1404
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
hiring

1405
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,200
and recruiting.

1406
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
People would say,

1407
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Andraž, we have these problems,

1408
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,200
and you get a job,

1409
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,200
and then you're like,

1410
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,200
ok, we're going to stop this project.

1411
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,200
And then people are like,

1412
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
no, we're going to close the company,

1413
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
and we're going to get a job.

1414
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
That's a problem I have.

1415
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
I, on the other hand,

1416
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
from the industry,

1417
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
think it's really weird.

1418
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
It's one of those things.

1419
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Talking about jobs,

1420
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
first of all,

1421
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,200
you have the staff,

1422
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,200
and then you have all the resources

1423
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,200
to go through this process.

1424
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
And then, even if you don't

1425
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,200
need to actively look,

1426
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,200
you still have these positions open,

1427
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
so you have a fresh pipeline

1428
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
of people,

1429
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
which you can technically hide.

1430
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,200
And if you're a company

1431
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
that's going to grow,

1432
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
it's really nice to have

1433
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
this pipeline of people

1434
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,200
that I mentor,

1435
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
and it's one thing.

1436
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
But if you have this,

1437
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,200
when you're hiding people,

1438
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,200
you have a team

1439
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,200
that deals with

1440
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
some potential

1441
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
new staff,

1442
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
which means you have

1443
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,200
a lot of hours,

1444
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
and you have a fixed schedule,

1445
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
so you're busy,

1446
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,200
you have people to work with,

1447
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
you're filling out a notepad.

1448
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
You also have some engineers

1449
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
that have to deal with it.

1450
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
It's a collateral damage.

1451
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
It's one hour for one technical screening,

1452
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
but you're filling this tunnel,

1453
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
and then you're starting to

1454
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
dilute the time in this funnel,

1455
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
and you're literally diluting it.

1456
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
And then at some point,

1457
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
when you're like,

1458
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
hey, we want to grow,

1459
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
you're just clearing this funnel.

1460
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,200
I've seen this,

1461
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,200
but you know,

1462
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
that's one thing.

1463
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200
The other thing,

1464
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
which I think a lot of companies do,

1465
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,200
is full stack engineering,

1466
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,200
and then what happens?

1467
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,200
When I send my mentors,

1468
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,200
I tell them,

1469
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
hey, you're a junior for us,

1470
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,200
you've done everything,

1471
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
you've done this system,

1472
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
and they've done that system,

1473
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,200
but these are private people,

1474
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
and we won't take you

1475
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
because you know too little.

1476
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,200
And that's one thing.

1477
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
And then there's one answer,

1478
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,200
hey, you know too little.

1479
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
The other thing,

1480
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
if you're a senior,

1481
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,200
you're actually

1482
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,200
pulling them through the interviews,

1483
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
so they're really poisoned.

1484
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,200
And then at the end,

1485
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
you say, hey,

1486
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
I want this,

1487
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
and you say, hey,

1488
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,200
that's too expensive.

1489
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,200
And then you have this exhaustion

1490
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,200
and you think,

1491
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,200
this person will take this offer,

1492
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,200
and you'll exhaust him.

1493
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
But something good

1494
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
probably isn't the only thing

1495
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
for which you...

1496
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,200
No, but you're

1497
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,200
8, 10, 14,

1498
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
and if you want to prepare...

1499
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
And then the engineer says,

1500
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
you have to ask in the second interview

1501
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
what the response fee is.

1502
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,200
That's our industry,

1503
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
you can't write hours for a meeting

1504
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
and travel expenses,

1505
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,200
so maybe somewhere else in the technical world.

1506
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
And then you have this.

1507
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,200
And again, it's the same trick.

1508
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
You have people who are

1509
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
permanently employed

1510
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,200
and those people,

1511
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
if they're idling you,

1512
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
aren't utilized.

1513
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
And then you look,

1514
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,200
if you get a good job,

1515
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
because you're still in the market,

1516
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
opening up some sectors

1517
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
with a good price-performance ratio,

1518
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
and then you have to

1519
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
take a risk.

1520
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
Watch out, there are people watching.

1521
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Yeah.

1522
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
You know, people ask me,

1523
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Andraž, we're looking for this

1524
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
profile for OBS,

1525
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,200
and I say, look,

1526
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
I know all the people I know,

1527
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,200
they're on vacation,

1528
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
and they're like, we're not interested.

1529
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,200
Because they know

1530
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
the best price-performance ratio

1531
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
is zero, so it's a discount.

1532
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
But they'll still come to me,

1533
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
and I'll get the job.

1534
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
And so,

1535
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
I get the same experience

1536
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,200
and the same questions.

1537
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
One of the things I tell people

1538
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
is that until you have

1539
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,200
a document,

1540
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
it's an offer,

1541
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
you haven't really changed.

1542
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Because I see people

1543
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
going, yeah, I'm the first step,

1544
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
then the second, then the third,

1545
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
maybe you try to

1546
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
talk to two or three companies,

1547
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
and then

1548
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
you try to get offers

1549
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
from different companies.

1550
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
Don't try to stick to one company

1551
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
on the first try.

1552
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
I know that

1553
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,200
it's not the best time,

1554
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
and there aren't a lot of offers,

1555
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
but try to take a risk

1556
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
and talk to bigger companies.

1557
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
And when you're in an interview,

1558
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
and they ask you if you talk to other companies,

1559
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
it's a bit like...

1560
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,200
It's a dance.

1561
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
I won't give you a football example,

1562
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
but I'll tell you that

1563
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
it's a bit like dating.

1564
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,200
If you're dating someone

1565
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
who's in Maribor,

1566
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,200
and he says,

1567
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
let's go on a date in Maribor,

1568
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
you go to Maribor,

1569
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,200
let's go on a date in Maribor,

1570
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,200
you go to another date in Maribor,

1571
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
and you say, if you come to Ljubljana,

1572
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
I don't know if I'm in Ljubljana now,

1573
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,200
I don't know if I'm in Ljubljana now,

1574
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
and I don't have a problem

1575
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,200
going on a date twice or three times.

1576
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,200
But if we don't change our date,

1577
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
they'll look at it in a different way.

1578
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
I mean,

1579
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
in our industry,

1580
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
you typically

1581
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
don't go on a date

1582
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,200
and don't count on a date.

1583
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
That's obvious to us.

1584
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,200
But you say,

1585
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,200
what's the cost of a new business?

1586
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,200
But if it's a date,

1587
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
it's a date,

1588
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,200
and it's the same

1589
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,200
with interviews,

1590
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,200
with domestic tasks.

1591
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,200
I always tell people,

1592
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,200
domestic tasks are bullshit,

1593
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,200
and in this process,

1594
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
they're doing engineering

1595
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
at the same time

1596
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,200
as you're doing it.

1597
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,200
The engineer will be on the car

1598
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,200
for six hours,

1599
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,200
and the domestic task for six hours.

1600
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,200
It's a symmetrical relationship.

1601
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,200
The job market,

1602
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
if we draw a line on this topic,

1603
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
is still broken.

1604
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
In my opinion, it's even more broken

1605
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
than it used to be.

1606
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
People use to say

1607
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
that the job market is broken.

1608
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Yes, we can't find

1609
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,200
too few engineers.

1610
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
In the end,

1611
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,200
seven steps out of the picture,

1612
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
or eight, and we kick the river.

1613
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
After 20 years of experience.

1614
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Crazy.

1615
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
If you don't have a job,

1616
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
you don't have a junior position.

1617
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,200
I'll ask people

1618
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
some more questions.

1619
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
Blendor from Maribor,

1620
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,200
shout out.

1621
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,200
He wrote to us,

1622
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,200
he would like to hear more about

1623
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,200
programming in robotics.

1624
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,200
Thank you, greetings from Maribor.

1625
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,200
What is robotics?

1626
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
Programming in robotics.

1627
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,200
He is completely interested in

1628
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,200
programming in robotics.

1629
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Apart from the fact that

1630
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
you programmed for Yaskawa,

1631
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
I don't think you have

1632
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
any experience in robotics.

1633
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
No.

1634
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
This is our job.

1635
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
We can discover things that interest us.

1636
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
That's why I said

1637
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,200
he should come.

1638
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,200
The thing with robotics is

1639
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
that they are great.

1640
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,200
But to have three-axis

1641
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
robots, as people imagined,

1642
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
with a lot of cars,

1643
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,200
it's not a big deal.

1644
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,200
What do you mean?

1645
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
It's not a big deal?

1646
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,200
When you are in the industry,

1647
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
you are working on a product.

1648
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
You are optimizing

1649
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,200
the most meaningful,

1650
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
complex solution for the application.

1651
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Meaning,

1652
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
if you have a milk cart in a dairy,

1653
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
you won't have a robot

1654
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,200
that moves in three axes

1655
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,200
to pour milk for you.

1656
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
If you could do it technically,

1657
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
it would be terrible to maintain.

1658
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,200
But it would look good.

1659
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,200
It would look good, yes.

1660
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,200
I haven't worked on projects with three-axis robots.

1661
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
They looked good.

1662
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,200
They looked fine.

1663
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200
For example, if you want to fill something

1664
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
from one container to another,

1665
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
you need a three-axis robot that pulls it out

1666
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,200
and moves it inside.

1667
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,200
Two engines, three engines.

1668
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,200
Two engines, one line,

1669
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,200
and then the thing moves.

1670
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Ok, I'll put it this way.

1671
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
In robotics, we will get

1672
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,200
someone who deals

1673
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,200
with industrial design,

1674
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,200
and we will talk about that.

1675
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,200
I'm more interested,

1676
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
when you started this project

1677
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
and with the robots,

1678
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
did you have any knowledge

1679
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,200
about how to fly,

1680
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,200
or how to fly?

1681
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
Is it like you give a tutorial

1682
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
and watch YouTube?

1683
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,200
How do you come to the level

1684
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,200
that you can fly?

1685
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
Is it something you have to be a part of

1686
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,199
a bigger organization to come to the level

1687
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,199
that you can fly?

1688
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,199
A lot of metadating.

1689
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:11,199
Robots are like networking.

1690
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:13,199
Proper networking.

1691
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,199
Not industrial,

1692
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:17,199
but for some big companies.

1693
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,199
You have a company

1694
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:21,199
that comes and says,

1695
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:23,199
we will make a line

1696
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:25,199
and we will do something.

1697
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:27,199
We will have three-axis robots,

1698
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:29,199
or packing milk.

1699
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,199
And then you call the vendors,

1700
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,199
who are really good at

1701
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:35,199
welding round things.

1702
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:37,199
ABB, if you watched

1703
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:39,199
a video from Tesla,

1704
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:41,199
when a drone flies

1705
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:43,199
those are not Tesla robots,

1706
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:45,199
those are ABB robots.

1707
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:47,199
They assemble cars

1708
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:49,199
and weld doors.

1709
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,199
And then you say,

1710
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:53,199
we have cash here,

1711
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,199
our process is like this.

1712
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,199
And then you exchange with the producer

1713
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,199
and their integration teams

1714
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:01,199
and they prepare everything.

1715
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:03,199
And it's like networking.

1716
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,199
You say, we have this application,

1717
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:07,199
you don't talk to the press,

1718
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:09,199
but you buy social equipment,

1719
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:11,199
you implement it,

1720
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:13,199
and it works.

1721
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,199
Because it's made to work.

1722
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:17,199
If you can't make a car in half an hour,

1723
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,199
it's completely lost.

1724
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,199
It's not hacking.

1725
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,199
It's a kind of career

1726
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,199
that is predictable,

1727
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,199
but on the other hand,

1728
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:29,199
it's not a big market,

1729
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,199
because when you do it once,

1730
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:33,199
it works.

1731
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,199
I think it's a bit of an overstatement.

1732
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,199
Wait, wait.

1733
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:39,199
No, no, wait.

1734
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,199
Let's get to the second part.

1735
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:43,199
What does it look like in Germany?

1736
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:45,199
And in Slovenia,

1737
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,199
it looks like this.

1738
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:49,199
We have a robot here,

1739
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,199
it has 15,000 hours.

1740
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:53,199
And we bought it at a high price.

1741
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,199
Is it needed?

1742
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,199
Yes, it's needed.

1743
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,199
The Germans will take it out

1744
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,199
because it's expensive

1745
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,199
and has a high error rate.

1746
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:05,199
And the robot that wasn't made

1747
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:07,199
is this Slovenian system.

1748
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,199
In the sense that we have

1749
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,199
a big network system here,

1750
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:13,199
and we're going to design it.

1751
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,199
And then you flick it,

1752
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,199
and it scans,

1753
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,199
and everything works.

1754
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,199
You described it as software developing.

1755
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,199
Wait for it to finish.

1756
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,199
Wait for that goal.

1757
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,199
And now you have something like that.

1758
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,199
But the good thing is that

1759
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,199
we find ourselves in the same situation.

1760
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,199
I'm not an automaton.

1761
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,199
I studied communication,

1762
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:37,199
but I'm an automaton.

1763
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,199
When you work in a company

1764
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,199
that knows robotics,

1765
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:43,199
you're not allowed to do that.

1766
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,199
There are some competitive clauses

1767
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,199
in those companies,

1768
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,199
and you're not allowed

1769
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,199
to do other things.

1770
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:53,199
Why would you touch a robot

1771
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:55,199
that's out of date,

1772
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,199
that's 40 years old?

1773
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,199
I think that's suffering.

1774
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,199
I've solved a lot of those projects

1775
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,199
that were totally broken.

1776
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,199
But also

1777
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,199
tooling...

1778
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,199
I mean,

1779
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,199
if I want to put

1780
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,199
milk in a pot,

1781
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,199
I'll buy

1782
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,199
a German-made robot.

1783
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,199
I'll probably buy

1784
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,199
a few brands that are the most popular,

1785
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,199
so I'll have some SDKs,

1786
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,199
and I'll prepare everything.

1787
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,199
SDKs?

1788
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,199
No, you buy a robot,

1789
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,199
and you get a controller.

1790
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,199
I don't know.

1791
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,199
You get a Siemens S-series controller,

1792
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,199
and you pay 15 euros

1793
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,199
for a license for the controller.

1794
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,199
And then you have

1795
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,199
the CAM development,

1796
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,199
where you have

1797
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,199
a simulator

1798
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,199
of how the hand moves,

1799
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,199
and for your application...

1800
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,199
It's visual, right?

1801
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,199
It's visual, yes.

1802
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,199
You program it,

1803
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,199
and you'll probably also

1804
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,199
change the hardware,

1805
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,199
because you have to change the pins,

1806
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,199
and if you buy it...

1807
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,199
You hack it at home,

1808
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,199
and you were probably smart

1809
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,199
and bought a 3-axis robot

1810
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,199
to make something

1811
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,199
that would be much simpler.

1812
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,199
I ask people,

1813
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,199
what is robotics?

1814
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,199
Because in your machine

1815
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,199
there's a robot,

1816
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,199
a 3-deficient robot.

1817
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,199
Can you imagine a 3-axis robot

1818
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,199
that you grab like this?

1819
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,199
Yes, I can.

1820
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,199
And that's also robotics.

1821
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,199
I wish there was a market for that.

1822
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,199
So, in the beginning...

1823
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,199
That's why in the educational system

1824
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,199
you don't have robotics,

1825
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,199
but you have automatics.

1826
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,199
Because when you hit a button,

1827
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,199
it's like they're doing

1828
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,199
some boring things

1829
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,199
for typical people,

1830
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,199
and they're not humanoid robots.

1831
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,199
But they're made to

1832
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,199
do very efficient things,

1833
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,199
to make a general

1834
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,199
humanoid robot,

1835
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,199
like Tesla does.

1836
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,199
If you're a computer scientist,

1837
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,199
we're very used to

1838
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,199
general purpose languages.

1839
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,199
It's great that general purpose

1840
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,199
can do anything.

1841
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,199
In the physical world,

1842
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,199
if you have an electric motor,

1843
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,199
and you don't use it,

1844
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,199
you'll fail anyway.

1845
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,199
And you don't want

1846
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,199
that thing to be productive.

1847
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,199
KPI in the industry

1848
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,199
is a bit lower

1849
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,199
than in software development.

1850
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,199
If you download it on Friday,

1851
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,199
it won't work.

1852
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,199
If BMW doesn't do it on Friday,

1853
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,199
the whole line will be like this.

1854
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:43,199
If they don't do it for 10 minutes,

1855
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,199
there will be a problem.

1856
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,199
Are people like the first experience

1857
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,199
with automatic robotics?

1858
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,199
With microcontrollers,

1859
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,199
Raspberry Pi,

1860
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,199
will everyone get a feeling

1861
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,199
of what it's all about?

1862
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,199
If you want to play with

1863
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,199
automatic robotics,

1864
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,199
I recommend the following.

1865
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,199
Buy a microcontroller,

1866
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,199
CX series, CX300,

1867
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,199
from Beko,

1868
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,199
and their IDE,

1869
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,199
and how it's compiled,

1870
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,199
you can also find it

1871
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,199
in Visual Studio.

1872
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,199
Visual Studio,

1873
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,199
it's for 100, you don't need

1874
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,199
a license,

1875
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,199
and FrontCosta,

1876
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,199
that microcontroller will cost

1877
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,199
500 euros.

1878
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,199
It's industry-grade,

1879
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,199
and you'll have

1880
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,199
that expectation.

1881
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,199
It's what it is.

1882
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,199
They've also made it

1883
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,199
so that

1884
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,199
when you open valves,

1885
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,199
you close valves.

1886
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,199
It's industry-grade,

1887
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,199
and it's very accessible.

1888
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,199
You take TwinCat,

1889
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,199
you take Beko,

1890
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,199
and microcontroller.

1891
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,199
If you call Beko in Slovenia,

1892
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,199
and tell them

1893
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,199
that you're a programmer,

1894
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,199
and that you'd like to play,

1895
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,199
they'll give it to you for 100,

1896
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,199
and they'll say,

1897
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,199
I'll give it back in a month.

1898
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,199
If you do it all at once,

1899
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,199
then they'll have new ones.

1900
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,199
He'll give it to you,

1901
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,199
you'll look at it,

1902
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,199
and he expects you to work on it.

1903
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,199
Anyway, you'll buy it.

1904
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,199
Tell me,

1905
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,199
will it be your new hobby?

1906
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,199
You have a house,

1907
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,199
and you have a bunch of robots

1908
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,199
inside to assemble a car.

1909
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,199
I'm lucky that we put a house

1910
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,199
in Milan.

1911
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,199
I don't have any automation

1912
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,199
in my house.

1913
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,199
For example, if I have a glass,

1914
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,199
I press it, and it goes up and down.

1915
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,199
If you're really cool...

1916
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,199
I don't have anything else.

1917
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,199
No Knix,

1918
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,199
no automation, no sensors,

1919
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,199
nothing. If I have it on my phone,

1920
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,199
I know it's washed and cleaned,

1921
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,199
I have it, but...

1922
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,199
If you're really cool,

1923
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,199
instead of eating end-consumer...

1924
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,400
or products for home automatization.

1925
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,280
You are like an industrialist inside.

1926
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,080
Because you will do better, but it won't be that easy.

1927
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,880
Blender, I hope you answered it.

1928
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,680
No, wait.

1929
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,480
And we hope that the next episode

1930
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,280
which will be very hardware,

1931
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,480
it won't be in robotics,

1932
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,480
but it will be very interesting.

1933
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,480
It's already in the pipeline

1934
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,200
and we have already agreed to film it.

1935
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:45,200
At this point, I would like to thank our supporters.

1936
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,200
I would like to thank Humanfrog,

1937
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,200
which supports us on this mission.

1938
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,200
I would like to thank Kaldi,

1939
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,200
which supports us on this mission.

1940
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,200
I would like to thank our new supporters,

1941
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,200
who joined us for this season.

1942
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,199
I would like to thank Visionact,

1943
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:07,199
and I would like to thank Kufr,

1944
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:12,199
which offered us 3TB of storage for our episodes.

1945
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:14,199
I would also like to thank everyone

1946
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,199
who supports us via Patreon.

1947
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:19,199
We are now on 8K resolution.

1948
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,199
No.

1949
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:23,199
And everyone who supports us on Patreon,

1950
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:26,199
one of the perks is that you can get

1951
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,199
Hey, did you bring the merch?

1952
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,199
Yes.

1953
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:33,199
I brought it by car.

1954
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:37,199
Andraž will confirm the presence of the merch in the building.

1955
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,199
So, thank you to everyone who supports us.

1956
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:42,199
These are cool companies and they help us

1957
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:45,199
to achieve our goals.

1958
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,199
Now, looking at the time,

1959
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:51,199
I think we still have two topics to discuss.

1960
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,199
Shoot.

1961
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:53,199
Right away.

1962
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,199
Right away.

1963
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:56,199
Don't lose the conversation.

1964
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,199
I thought it was about robotics.

1965
01:16:58,199 --> 01:16:59,199
No, no.

1966
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,199
That was a good one.

1967
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,199
We have two more questions.

1968
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:09,199
One was from Robert Sedovšek.

1969
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,199
How to connect your domain knowledge

1970
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:15,199
with a hobby that has no direct connection

1971
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:18,199
with technology and build a business out of it?

1972
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:21,199
This was written by the guest of the wrong podcast

1973
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,199
Miha Rekar's Parallel Passion.

1974
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,199
It's a Slovenian podcast.

1975
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:28,199
Miha has been doing it for some time.

1976
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:31,199
It's more about what you do

1977
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:35,199
besides being an expert in technology.

1978
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,199
The main question is how to connect

1979
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:40,199
your domain knowledge with a hobby

1980
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:42,199
and how to do something with it.

1981
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,199
I thought about it a lot and studied it.

1982
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:48,199
Learn marketing and sales.

1983
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:49,199
No, really.

1984
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,199
If you think about it,

1985
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:54,199
you know something about technology

1986
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:56,199
and you're interested in something.

1987
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:58,199
For example, about software.

1988
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:01,199
You say, we're going to make an app for software.

1989
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,199
It's simple.

1990
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:04,199
You know about software or a hobby

1991
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:06,199
and you know about technology.

1992
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:08,199
But what you really don't know

1993
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:10,199
is marketing and sales.

1994
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,199
If you know these two,

1995
01:18:12,199 --> 01:18:15,199
the most typical thing in the world

1996
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,199
which is product development,

1997
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,199
is to do it in Excel

1998
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,199
and learn marketing and sales.

1999
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,199
That's how you'll see if it's interesting.

2000
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,199
In the end,

2001
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:28,199
when I look at everything,

2002
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:30,199
it's all about business.

2003
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:34,199
Neither your hobby nor your technical implementation

2004
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:35,199
is important.

2005
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,199
You need to get those two skills up

2006
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,199
so that you can launch it.

2007
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,199
It's hard to hear,

2008
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,199
especially if you're good at technology.

2009
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:49,199
You need to lower the technological level

2010
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,199
so that it's not as important

2011
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,199
as marketing,

2012
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:56,199
entrepreneurship,

2013
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,199
validation of ideas,

2014
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:00,199
especially if you're at the beginning.

2015
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:03,199
These are very different skill sets

2016
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,199
and different metrics

2017
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,199
when it comes to software development.

2018
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:10,199
You need to trust.

2019
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:12,199
Look at our Tomas.

2020
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:14,199
He was like,

2021
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,200
I didn't like the end consumer

2022
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,200
from the optics operator.

2023
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,200
I hacked it and now I'm making my own router.

2024
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,200
You need to trust.

2025
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,200
You need to know these things.

2026
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,200
You can't be prejudiced.

2027
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
You need to simply...

2028
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,200
In the long run,

2029
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,200
marketing and sales are geniuses.

2030
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,200
That's it.

2031
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
You drive it.

2032
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:47,200
You're lucky that it's all the same for you.

2033
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:51,200
No, I think you said it.

2034
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,200
But I don't know if it's...

2035
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,200
It's a missing link

2036
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,200
if you go into a business.

2037
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,200
I understand the question

2038
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,200
where you find the connection

2039
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,200
with your hobbies.

2040
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,200
But that's really...

2041
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,200
I know what you want to hear.

2042
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,200
In the end,

2043
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,200
it's the hard work

2044
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,200
that's not really your hobby.

2045
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,200
In life,

2046
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,200
when you're down and scared,

2047
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,200
you can always move on.

2048
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
That's your northern star.

2049
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
So marketing and sales.

2050
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,200
But there are certain things

2051
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,200
that you'll never be good at.

2052
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
That's why you outsource.

2053
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
Yes, but...

2054
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,200
You can only learn certain things

2055
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,200
to a certain extent.

2056
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,200
Maybe you're the type of person

2057
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,200
that will never do certain things.

2058
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,200
Or for certain things,

2059
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
you can invest a lot of time

2060
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,200
and it doesn't make sense

2061
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
if you can't do it.

2062
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
I strive for it,

2063
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
and I'll tell you my answer.

2064
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
First of all, you're a partner

2065
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
who knows good marketing and sales.

2066
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,200
But you need to know

2067
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,200
that the technical part

2068
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
is a minor part of the product.

2069
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
That's the thing.

2070
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
You need to find a partner

2071
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,200
or a team

2072
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
to come together

2073
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,200
when you're doing it alone.

2074
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
I have a great team.

2075
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,200
I mean,

2076
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,200
let's go back to the beginning.

2077
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
Let's say,

2078
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,200
if only one person

2079
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,200
was doing this podcast,

2080
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,200
how far would you go?

2081
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,200
That's what I'm striving for.

2082
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,200
Maybe I...

2083
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,200
Well...

2084
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,200
In the first place,

2085
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,200
I see that...

2086
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,200
One thing is OK.

2087
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Let's talk about it.

2088
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,200
We'll get into it

2089
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,200
in due time.

2090
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,200
We'll invite people together,

2091
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,200
choose a topic,

2092
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,200
look for speakers,

2093
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,200
talk about it.

2094
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,200
Then we'll patch it.

2095
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,200
Then we need to

2096
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,200
edit it,

2097
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,200
make it deliverable.

2098
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,200
And then

2099
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,200
you need to make your product

2100
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,200
reach people.

2101
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,200
And if you failed

2102
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,200
to make it work,

2103
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,200
to have an excellent product

2104
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,200
but you didn't give it to people,

2105
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,200
you failed.

2106
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,200
Maybe you need to think

2107
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,200
about how to develop it

2108
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,200
and how to make it

2109
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,200
reach the people

2110
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,200
who need it.

2111
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,200
How far will I go?

2112
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,200
One of the good

2113
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
early moments

2114
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,200
with Ugrodje was

2115
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,200
when I went to meetups

2116
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,200
and asked people

2117
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,200
what Ugrodje is,

2118
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,200
why we do it.

2119
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,200
They said it's interesting.

2120
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,200
Then they picked up the phone

2121
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,200
and wrote Ugrodje in front of me.

2122
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,200
Ugrodje doesn't exist on YouTube.

2123
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,200
I realized

2124
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,200
that our product,

2125
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,200
if it's the best on the market,

2126
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,200
will miss the last step

2127
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,200
to reach the people it's meant for.

2128
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,200
And you're not here.

2129
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,200
Try to figure out

2130
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,200
who you're working with,

2131
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,200
give them feedback,

2132
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,200
give them feedback,

2133
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,200
give them feedback,

2134
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,200
and ask

2135
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,200
how you'll get money

2136
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,200
from them in the end.

2137
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,200
I think it's important

2138
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,200
what your goal is.

2139
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Are we building a job

2140
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,200
or are we sharing ideas?

2141
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,200
Or are we sharing something?

2142
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,200
It can be two very different things.

2143
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,200
I think it's very important

2144
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,200
that

2145
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,200
what you started

2146
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,200
when you started

2147
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,200
or whatever you started doing,

2148
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,200
it's a path.

2149
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,200
You're learning on this path.

2150
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,200
Maybe it's not exactly

2151
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,200
for a bricklayer,

2152
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,200
maybe it would be

2153
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,200
for a gardener.

2154
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,200
You have to be

2155
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,200
objective

2156
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,200
when you look at your ideas.

2157
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
You have to be prepared

2158
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,200
in front of criticism

2159
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,200
and correct that direction.

2160
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,200
To find what you're meant for.

2161
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,200
If you're going into business,

2162
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,200
you're going to pivot

2163
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,200
in a different direction.

2164
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,200
If it's not

2165
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,200
your hobby anymore,

2166
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,200
you'll probably turn your business

2167
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,200
aside and say,

2168
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,200
that's not what I want to do.

2169
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,200
There are a lot of books about it.

2170
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,200
I think you'll need

2171
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,200
to find them quickly.

2172
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,200
In the end, it's up to you

2173
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,200
how you're going to do it.

2174
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,200
It's convenient.

2175
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,200
On the other hand,

2176
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,200
it's not so bad to get some seed money.

2177
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,200
When people give you money,

2178
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,200
they torture you

2179
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,200
and it's going to

2180
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,200
suck.

2181
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,200
One comment is

2182
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,200
that as soon as

2183
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,200
you find people

2184
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,200
who see the same problems

2185
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,200
in the same space,

2186
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,200
you're going to solve

2187
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,200
them with a product.

2188
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,200
As soon as you find that feedback,

2189
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,200
you're going to see who you're working for.

2190
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,200
I think that's a lie.

2191
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,200
Whether it's a business

2192
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,200
or a hobby,

2193
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,200
you need a partner to help you.

2194
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,200
As soon as you find

2195
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,200
a group of people

2196
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,200
on a subreddit

2197
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,200
or a club,

2198
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,200
whatever,

2199
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,200
you're done.

2200
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,200
Tomas already said that

2201
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,200
I think that we gave

2202
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,200
some sources.

2203
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,200
Mark, I think we addressed it well.

2204
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,200
Let's open one.

2205
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,200
Let's do it quickly.

2206
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,200
Let's just ask.

2207
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,200
Are you going to do a lot in the cloud?

2208
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,200
No,

2209
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,200
we're going to do it in the cloud.

2210
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,200
We received

2211
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,200
one more question

2212
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,200
from one of our

2213
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,200
members.

2214
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,200
His nickname is

2215
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,200
fighter slash random user

2216
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,200
1, 2, 3, 4.

2217
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,200
Sniper16.

2218
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,200
I'm interested

2219
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,200
in AI and Jobs.

2220
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,200
How will it affect

2221
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
juniors

2222
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,200
who have been employed for a year

2223
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,200
and those who are not yet?

2224
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,200
Maybe this is also

2225
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,200
a question we had

2226
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,200
before.

2227
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,200
How do you see

2228
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,200
using

2229
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,200
the latest AI tooling?

2230
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,200
How do you see

2231
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,200
day-to-day Jobs

2232
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,200
changing because of it?

2233
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,200
If you can give

2234
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,200
an insight

2235
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,200
on how it affects

2236
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,200
juniors.

2237
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,200
You started

2238
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,200
using it more.

2239
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
Is it easy to use it?

2240
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,200
I started

2241
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
in the last

2242
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,200
two or three years

2243
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,200
using AI

2244
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,200
more.

2245
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,200
I have two

2246
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,200
use cases.

2247
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,200
The last

2248
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,200
two B-Sides events

2249
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,200
wouldn't have happened

2250
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,200
without AI.

2251
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,200
We lost

2252
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,200
Katja, who used to

2253
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,200
run PR and

2254
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,200
marketing.

2255
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,200
She became

2256
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,200
busy and

2257
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,200
no one could generate

2258
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,200
text.

2259
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,200
ChetGDP was good enough

2260
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,200
to make

2261
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,200
this trivial.

2262
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,200
This is

2263
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,200
one such use case.

2264
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,200
I imagine

2265
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,200
that in

2266
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,200
the agency

2267
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,200
AI

2268
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,200
reduces

2269
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,200
certain tasks.

2270
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,200
It can

2271
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
overwhelm

2272
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,200
a certain person.

2273
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,200
It is still

2274
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,200
a problem to write

2275
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,200
a good prompt.

2276
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,200
Maybe there are more

2277
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,200
gifts in engineering

2278
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,200
and how to get something

2279
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,200
done.

2280
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,200
What do you use

2281
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,200
specifically?

2282
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,200
We know that the agency

2283
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,200
generates the text.

2284
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,200
In the last year

2285
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
I was in a process

2286
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,200
where a

2287
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,200
SaaS product is being developed

2288
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,200
which is more like

2289
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,200
a no-code compilation of

2290
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
Lego bricks.

2291
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,200
I have to use this product

2292
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,200
as well.

2293
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,200
There is a group of

2294
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,200
JSON objects.

2295
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,200
I help

2296
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,200
a lot of things

2297
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,200
with jq

2298
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,200
when I make transformations.

2299
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,200
It is very

2300
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,200
simple to say

2301
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,200
this is my object

2302
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,200
or JSON object.

2303
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,200
I want it to look

2304
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,200
like a command

2305
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,200
or jq

2306
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,200
filtering

2307
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,200
or tasks.

2308
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
I use it

2309
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,200
on a daily basis.

2310
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,200
Recently

2311
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,200
I learned a lot

2312
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
because

2313
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,200
in a way

2314
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,200
you learn jq syntax

2315
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,200
in an experienced way.

2316
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
This was

2317
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,200
a good use case

2318
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,200
in my case

2319
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
where the task

2320
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,200
was maximized.

2321
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,200
I don't program

2322
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,200
and I didn't

2323
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,200
need an AI

2324
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,200
to write a boilerplate

2325
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,200
or to prepare a code.

2326
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,200
But when I need

2327
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,200
to make a transformation

2328
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,200
it is easy to use.

2329
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,200
If you generate

2330
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,200
jq expressions

2331
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,200
you just take

2332
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,200
the input,

2333
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
look at the output

2334
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,200
and try

2335
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,200
to understand

2336
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,200
what the output is.

2337
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,200
It depends.

2338
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,200
Sometimes it is good

2339
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,200
if you know you will need

2340
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,200
to change something

2341
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,200
and then you can

2342
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,200
do it yourself.

2343
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,200
It is good to start

2344
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,200
with a very simple JSON object

2345
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,200
with 10.000 classes

2346
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,200
and a nested JSON

2347
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,200
for 9.

2348
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,200
Debugging is a bit

2349
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,200
hard to understand

2350
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,200
for 9.

2351
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,200
But yes, it is

2352
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,200
a very...

2353
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,200
I would say

2354
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,200
that jq is one example.

2355
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,200
I would say that

2356
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,200
anyone can snipe

2357
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,200
some codes and say

2358
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,200
I need this code to behave

2359
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
a bit differently

2360
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,200
and you can get

2361
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,200
a very good score

2362
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,200
that you can already use.

2363
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,200
Recently I tried

2364
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,200
a network configuration

2365
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,200
and it is written

2366
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,200
in the configuration

2367
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,200
of vendor A

2368
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,200
and it transforms

2369
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,200
into vendor B

2370
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,200
and for a lot of things

2371
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,200
it was a very good approach.

2372
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,200
I won't say that I hope

2373
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,200
the same will happen

2374
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,200
on direct production

2375
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,200
on the vendor B box.

2376
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,200
But you can get

2377
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,200
and it is used

2378
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,200
in some way.

2379
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,200
Have you tried different models?

2380
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,200
Do you pay for them?

2381
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,200
Yes, currently I use OpenAI the most.

2382
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,200
I have tried

2383
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,199
others as well

2384
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,199
but somehow

2385
01:32:06,199 --> 01:32:08,199
everything that is payable

2386
01:32:08,199 --> 01:32:10,199
is OpenAI more

2387
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,199
focused than anything else.

2388
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:14,199
Ok.

2389
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:16,199
I write 90%

2390
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:18,199
of the code for AI.

2391
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:20,199
But it is very different

2392
01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:22,199
than what people imagine.

2393
01:32:22,199 --> 01:32:24,199
It doesn't mean that you say

2394
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:26,199
I have this problem,

2395
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:28,199
write me this.

2396
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:30,199
Or you use

2397
01:32:30,199 --> 01:32:32,199
something integrated in the editor.

2398
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:34,199
And I already have a code

2399
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,199
or a pivot

2400
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:38,199
and then I make micro-changes.

2401
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:40,199
I say, change

2402
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:42,199
this so that I literally know

2403
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:44,199
if this does this

2404
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:46,199
and then it flows out

2405
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:48,199
and then everything

2406
01:32:48,199 --> 01:32:50,199
that is written to me

2407
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:52,199
goes through the editing process

2408
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,199
and then I say, this is fine

2409
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:56,199
or I make some changes.

2410
01:32:56,199 --> 01:32:58,199
But I don't type

2411
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:00,199
the code as I would

2412
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:02,199
if I wrote a function.

2413
01:33:02,199 --> 01:33:04,199
Very little.

2414
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:06,199
I say, this is a bash

2415
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:08,199
I don't know what a bash is

2416
01:33:08,199 --> 01:33:10,199
write me a bash function

2417
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:12,199
For example, the word bash

2418
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:14,199
and shell

2419
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:16,199
you make very fast syntactic changes

2420
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:18,199
because it is a very rigid language

2421
01:33:18,199 --> 01:33:20,199
you will forget the sequence

2422
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:22,199
and it won't do anything.

2423
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:24,199
It is not what it auto-generates

2424
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:26,199
a hundred times more.

2425
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:28,199
It works very poorly

2426
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:30,199
on github actions

2427
01:33:30,199 --> 01:33:32,199
it doesn't work very well.

2428
01:33:32,199 --> 01:33:34,199
I do it manually

2429
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:36,199
but everything else is written to me.

2430
01:33:36,199 --> 01:33:38,199
But these are micro-questions

2431
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:40,199
I get the result in the editing process

2432
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:42,199
and then I iterate it.

2433
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:44,199
I don't have to type

2434
01:33:44,199 --> 01:33:46,199
the syntax of the language

2435
01:33:46,199 --> 01:33:48,199
anymore

2436
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:50,199
and also my prompts

2437
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:52,199
are already synthesized

2438
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:54,199
or postulated.

2439
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:56,199
I don't write in human language

2440
01:33:56,199 --> 01:33:58,199
with this AI.

2441
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,199
I say seven words

2442
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:02,199
and it understands.

2443
01:34:02,199 --> 01:34:04,199
We already have a relationship

2444
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:06,199
whatever that means.

2445
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:08,199
I use it a lot

2446
01:34:08,199 --> 01:34:10,199
in an office setting

2447
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:12,199
private

2448
01:34:12,199 --> 01:34:14,199
and also

2449
01:34:14,199 --> 01:34:16,199
in a business setting.

2450
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:18,199
I get all the transactions

2451
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:20,199
which are not my personal

2452
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:22,199
or business transactions

2453
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:24,199
but a food marketer.

2454
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:26,199
I connect it

2455
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:28,199
and then I engineer the prompt

2456
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:30,199
so that it pulls

2457
01:34:30,199 --> 01:34:32,199
400 transactions per year

2458
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:34,199
and then I group them

2459
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:36,199
these are categories

2460
01:34:36,199 --> 01:34:38,199
that it helps me.

2461
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:40,199
I say, try to do it yourself

2462
01:34:40,199 --> 01:34:42,199
and if you don't like it

2463
01:34:42,199 --> 01:34:44,199
solve it one by one

2464
01:34:44,199 --> 01:34:46,199
and I will only write categories for you.

2465
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:48,199
It's easier for me

2466
01:34:48,199 --> 01:34:50,199
to access them in Excel or Sheets.

2467
01:34:50,199 --> 01:34:52,199
And then I go to work

2468
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:54,199
and that's how I do it.

2469
01:34:54,199 --> 01:34:56,199
Do you use OpenAI or GPT

2470
01:34:56,199 --> 01:34:58,199
or do you use LAMO

2471
01:34:58,199 --> 01:35:00,199
and Selfhost

2472
01:35:00,199 --> 01:35:02,199
or do you use different vendors?

2473
01:35:02,199 --> 01:35:04,199
I used LAMO

2474
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,199
quite often

2475
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:08,199
because I was more interested

2476
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:10,199
in their implementation

2477
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:12,199
of guardrails

2478
01:35:12,199 --> 01:35:14,199
and how to

2479
01:35:14,199 --> 01:35:16,199
create an escape.

2480
01:35:16,199 --> 01:35:18,199
Obviously.

2481
01:35:18,199 --> 01:35:20,199
Yeah, ok.

2482
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:22,199
It's very good

2483
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:24,199
for work

2484
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:26,199
it's not

2485
01:35:26,199 --> 01:35:28,199
strictly trivial

2486
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:30,199
but I felt

2487
01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:32,199
that it was

2488
01:35:32,199 --> 01:35:34,199
quite slow

2489
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:36,199
and it's a fast laptop

2490
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:38,199
and I think

2491
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:40,199
that

2492
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:42,199
if

2493
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:44,199
it was just on the fly

2494
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:46,199
it's good enough

2495
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:48,199
but it's definitely

2496
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:50,199
as slow as

2497
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:52,199
a paid service

2498
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:54,199
where you upload

2499
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:56,199
a prompt and you get

2500
01:35:56,199 --> 01:35:58,199
a relatively fast response.

2501
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:00,199
Now I will go back

2502
01:36:00,199 --> 01:36:02,199
to the question

2503
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:04,199
how did it affect you as a junior?

2504
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:06,199
Terrible.

2505
01:36:06,199 --> 01:36:08,199
Why?

2506
01:36:08,199 --> 01:36:10,199
It's so hard now

2507
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:12,199
It's so depressing.

2508
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:14,199
It's like

2509
01:36:14,199 --> 01:36:16,199
you have a mentor

2510
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:18,199
and you encourage him

2511
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:20,199
and you tell him

2512
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:22,199
that you are doing well

2513
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:24,199
and that you are learning

2514
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:26,199
for example

2515
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:28,199
if you are older

2516
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:30,199
and you have to pay the rent

2517
01:36:30,199 --> 01:36:32,199
you tell him

2518
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:34,199
that he can find

2519
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:36,199
a job

2520
01:36:36,199 --> 01:36:38,199
and that he will be the first

2521
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:40,199
in a month

2522
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:42,199
to work on low-hanging fruit

2523
01:36:42,199 --> 01:36:44,199
which is a mechanic

2524
01:36:44,199 --> 01:36:46,199
which is not

2525
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:48,199
a system design

2526
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:50,199
for a normal engineer

2527
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:52,199
and that it's a bit of a pain

2528
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:54,199
and that's the problem now.

2529
01:36:54,199 --> 01:36:56,199
Those tasks are getting harder

2530
01:36:56,199 --> 01:36:58,199
and if I need a shot

2531
01:36:58,199 --> 01:37:00,199
or something that is not

2532
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:02,199
very architectural

2533
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:04,199
which is ideal for a beginner

2534
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:06,199
then it's not a big deal.

2535
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:08,199
And now

2536
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:10,199
my productivity

2537
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:12,199
has increased a lot

2538
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:14,199
and I don't say it like that

2539
01:37:14,199 --> 01:37:16,199
it's a part of the job

2540
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:18,199
For example, I was

2541
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:20,199
No, but I don't know

2542
01:37:20,199 --> 01:37:22,199
I am 2x faster

2543
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:24,199
If I was, in the past

2544
01:37:24,199 --> 01:37:26,199
it was a shell check

2545
01:37:26,199 --> 01:37:28,199
and you forgot something

2546
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:30,199
and now it's done

2547
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:32,199
it works

2548
01:37:32,199 --> 01:37:34,199
and you can test it

2549
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:36,199
but it's very fast

2550
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:38,199
and it's a huge

2551
01:37:38,199 --> 01:37:40,199
problem

2552
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:42,199
which I hope the industry

2553
01:37:42,199 --> 01:37:44,199
will realize that the gap

2554
01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:46,199
has widened a bit

2555
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:48,199
On the other hand,

2556
01:37:48,199 --> 01:37:50,199
you have a body

2557
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:52,199
which is indestructible

2558
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:54,199
and you can chat with it

2559
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:56,199
I ask myself

2560
01:37:56,199 --> 01:37:58,199
how do I poison it

2561
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:00,199
it answers me

2562
01:38:00,199 --> 01:38:02,199
like it's fresh

2563
01:38:02,199 --> 01:38:04,199
when I'm not thinking

2564
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:06,199
and then

2565
01:38:06,199 --> 01:38:08,199
how do we solve

2566
01:38:08,199 --> 01:38:10,199
problems we need to change

2567
01:38:10,199 --> 01:38:12,199
both seniors and juniors

2568
01:38:12,199 --> 01:38:14,199
if you say, I don't know

2569
01:38:14,199 --> 01:38:16,199
what you told me

2570
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:18,199
write it down

2571
01:38:18,199 --> 01:38:20,199
the psychologist will calm you down

2572
01:38:20,199 --> 01:38:22,199
he will ask you

2573
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:24,199
don't ask him

2574
01:38:24,199 --> 01:38:26,199
for deterministic results

2575
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:28,199
I have this problem

2576
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:30,199
write me a syntax code

2577
01:38:30,199 --> 01:38:32,199
and when you ask him

2578
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:34,199
how do I get rid of it

2579
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:36,199
you can hurt them

2580
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:38,199
if you ask procedurally

2581
01:38:38,199 --> 01:38:40,199
what do I do

2582
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:42,199
or I don't know

2583
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:44,199
how do I recommend it to my superiors

2584
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:46,199
he can give you

2585
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:48,199
a very simple answer

2586
01:38:48,199 --> 01:38:50,199
I know it's a bit creepy

2587
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:52,199
but it helps me a lot

2588
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:54,199
I do a lot of tests

2589
01:38:54,199 --> 01:38:56,199
which are complex

2590
01:38:56,199 --> 01:38:58,199
and then I have a rubber duck

2591
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:00,199
and then I challenge myself

2592
01:39:02,199 --> 01:39:04,199
I think

2593
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:06,199
that you will

2594
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:08,199
for all the new people

2595
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:10,199
coming to the industry

2596
01:39:10,199 --> 01:39:12,199
who are at the very beginning

2597
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:14,199
or for example

2598
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:16,199
those who are not registered

2599
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:18,199
it's

2600
01:39:18,199 --> 01:39:20,199
an opportunity

2601
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:22,199
it will be their new reality

2602
01:39:22,199 --> 01:39:24,199
I am more afraid

2603
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:26,199
that all those who

2604
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:28,199
in the last 10 years

2605
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:30,199
in this industry

2606
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:32,199
and now

2607
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:34,199
they didn't manage

2608
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:36,199
to grow up

2609
01:39:36,199 --> 01:39:38,199
and it will

2610
01:39:38,199 --> 01:39:40,199
present a problem

2611
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:44,199
I think

2612
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:46,199
I don't know if

2613
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:48,199
they will take

2614
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:50,199
their services

2615
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:52,199
but they will be able

2616
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:54,199
to show something more

2617
01:39:54,199 --> 01:39:56,199
they will need

2618
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:58,199
country to...

2619
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I don't want to sound like an ex-developer, but if this automatic will be lost in the blink of an eye,

2620
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
then you need fewer people to do these things.

2621
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
You know, this is where it all comes down to.

2622
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Not that we have changed things more effectively,

2623
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,000
but now we have added additional tasks to them.

2624
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Because they will perform better anyway,

2625
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
because they have the right tooling,

2626
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Andral can now do a lot more tasks,

2627
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
he doesn't have to write code anymore,

2628
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
it's less of a problem,

2629
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
he talks to himself, the code is written.

2630
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Let's give him more things to do.

2631
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So I don't know if this is a parallel,

2632
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
that there will be fewer people now.

2633
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I think that a certain number of people will be lost.

2634
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:06,000
AI will also need to be directed to some extent,

2635
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
it will need to be programmed,

2636
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
it will need to write good prompts,

2637
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
it will need to check if things are going in the right direction.

2638
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Maybe it will be a part of knowing that AI is a blood,

2639
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
that it will dedicate roles to people who specialize in that direction.

2640
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So I wouldn't say that it's a black scenario.

2641
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
The biggest problem we probably have,

2642
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
because we've been in the industry for a long time,

2643
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
and in a way we're used to it.

2644
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
You know what I find really interesting?

2645
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
If you look at last season,

2646
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
we had people who had a lack of sleep,

2647
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
or had gray hair,

2648
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and everyone told you,

2649
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
lack of sleep, lack of sleep,

2650
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
lack of sleep in networking,

2651
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
lack of sleep in system engineering,

2652
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
everyone argues that people lack sleep,

2653
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
that people fall asleep a lot.

2654
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
This tooling,

2655
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
it gives you some answers,

2656
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
and you're more productive.

2657
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
But how reliable is that code,

2658
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
how safe is that code?

2659
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
If Andraž generates 10 times more code,

2660
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
the whole software development life cycle is different.

2661
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
You will still need sleep.

2662
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
You will be more effective,

2663
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,000
you are more effective in determining those tasks

2664
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
that are time consuming,

2665
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
that will go away now,

2666
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
but you will still need to be successful,

2667
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
you will need critical distance,

2668
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
you will need to have some knowledge,

2669
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
some skills.

2670
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Or a better model.

2671
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Look, it's very simple.

2672
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
What is it to be a liar?

2673
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
A journalist who writes a bad article,

2674
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
or an editor of ten journalists

2675
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
who writes bad articles?

2676
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I'm a journalist who worked on bad articles,

2677
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I'm not an editor who evaluates through AI

2678
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
if the output is OK or not.

2679
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
But I'm still responsible, aren't I?

2680
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That's right, dear juniors.

2681
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Everything will be fine.

2682
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Everything will be fine.

2683
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
That's true,

2684
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
what's the variant of stop, precedent, panic?

2685
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
No, but look,

2686
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
if we say, hey, you didn't fall asleep,

2687
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
or people who go on interviews tell me,

2688
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
hey, you didn't know that.

2689
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Your mentor is relentless.

2690
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And at will, too,

2691
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
at three in the morning,

2692
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
you let him talk to you.

2693
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's not just that.

2694
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
In practice, you can ask him

2695
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
even more stupid questions.

2696
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
When you do an interview,

2697
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
you think, if he asks me that,

2698
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I'll really know that I don't know.

2699
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
In practice, you can ask him that.

2700
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
And the probability that he will answer

2701
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
a statistical question for a junior

2702
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
is really good.

2703
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
In the case of legacy systems,

2704
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
which are not Greenfield projects,

2705
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
which are complex,

2706
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
you won't miss the chance

2707
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
to magically solve AI.

2708
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
And we've had that in history a hundred times.

2709
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
From graphic programming to...

2710
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
You just forget that in history

2711
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
we haven't learned anything yet.

2712
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yes, yes.

2713
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
With this conversation,

2714
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I realized that most of my time

2715
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
has passed today.

2716
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
What do you mean?

2717
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
In the beginning, you said you were a host.

2718
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

2719
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
it's time for a beer.

2720
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
It's time for a beer

2721
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
in the Gospodar's exhibition.

2722
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
We won't say more.

2723
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Let's bring this ship down.

2724
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Let's thank the people

2725
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
and give them a beer.

2726
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Thank you for being

2727
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
our listeners in Grodno today.

2728
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Thank you for supporting us.

2729
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Thank you for hanging out

2730
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
with us in our Discord.

2731
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I hope to see you

2732
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
at some of the events.

2733
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Thank you for your support.

2734
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Anything else you want to add?

2735
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Thank you, Jan, for recording us.

2736
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Thank you, Jan, for taking the time

2737
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
to be here with the other two teams.

2738
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Thank you all for your help

2739
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
and see you soon.

2740
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Bye-bye!
